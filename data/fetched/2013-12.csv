Mechanical personnel notified the trainmaster who then made the appropriate notifications. The car was isolated, a buffer zone established for safety, and emergency responders activated.    Once on site responders conducted a safety briefing and then accessed the railcar. All tank car appurtenances were inspected for tightness and upon further inspection it was determined that the fill hole cover was improperly tightened during loading, creating a small gap for product to escape on one side. The fill hole gasket was verified compatible and in good repair and responders re-tightened fill hole cover in appropriate order. Once tightened, a slosh test was performed on the car. No new leaks detected. Lading that had leaked was neutralized and wiped from the top and sides of the railcar. Once tank car was decontaminated adequately, it was released for normal transportation.    * No injuries reported    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.      (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O. Box 219335, Kansas City, MO 64121.  The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

Appropriate notifications were made and hazmat responders activated.     *No injuries reported    At approximately 3:00 AM on 12/4/13 (the following morning) responders arrived on site, met with KCSR representative to discuss safety briefing and locate the car. Once the site was deemed safe, responders accessed the tank car. Upon further inspection of the car, it was noted that the release point was coming from the O-Ring cap of the Pressure Relief Device (PRD). Incorrect/incompatible o-ring in PRD. Responders removed o-rings, cleaned, and replaced ""flipped around,"" the o-rings into the PRD. After several air monitoring events, it was noted that the leak had stopped and the field repair was deemed adequate for the package to continue to final destination.     The tank car was secured and responders demobilized from location    File Note: Item 13-The consignee address and final destination are different according to the waybill.

The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.      (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O. Box 219335, Kansas City, MO 64121.  The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

About 5 miles north of the facility on US Hwy 169, the driver had to apply his brakes very hard to avoid a collision and the load shifted.  The driver inspected the load and noticed a small drip from one of the transformers.  Apparently one of the radiator fins was breached when the rear transformer slid into the front transformer and PCB oil began to leak.  As the truck continued to the in the intended waste treatment facility located in Coffeyville some PCB oil was lost.  When the load arrived at the waste treatment facility there was leaked PCB oil both in the pan and on the trailer. A response crew was summoned, donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and worked through the night cleaning the oil trail on the highway from the location where the incident occurred to the disposal facility.  The sheriff's department and local fire department was notified and came to the scene to monitor the cleanup activities.  The KDHE (Mr. John Jones) was notified, incident # 35001; EPA (Mr. John Frey) was notified; and, the NRC (Officer Hardy) was notified, incident # 1067360. The total volume lost from the transformer was estimated to be 28 gallons.  Of the total volume lost, 8 gallons was contained in the spill pan and the remaining 20 gallons was released.  Of the 20 gallons released, 10 gallons was released to the highway access with 5 gallons of the 10 gallons spilled in a localized area approximately 100 yards north of where the railroad crosses the highway.  The localized release was excavated, removed, sampled and backfilled.  The remaining 10 gallons was released on the waste management facility property.  Discernible release points on the Hwy. were hexane rinsed, absorbed with oil absorbent, then the absorbent was removed.  The concentration of the released PCB liquid was 760,000 ppm.","The driver was suspended for 10 days, was re-trained on load securement, accident/incident reporting and on-road contingency plan.  In addition, the dispatcher received a written warning and retraining on incident reporting/spill plan.  Both individuals will present a lessons learned to the entire staff at an upcoming safety meeting.  As far as the cleanup goes the activities continue.

The driver stopped the unit and the local hazmat team responded to secure the release and a second unit was dispatched to transfer the material. It was originally reported that up to 30 gallons of material was released onto the asphalt parking area. Upon arrival of a response contractor it was discovered that approximately 500 gallons of material had been released prior to the transfer being completed. The material impacted an approximate 60'x500' area of the parking area and had entered a storm drain which leads to a dry retention basin.

CELLUCCI,SVP TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE,42 LONGWATER DR,NORWELL,MA,02061-1612,Carrier,"On 12-4-2013 at approximately 8:45 AM, a Roche Carolina Inc. (RCI) utilities operator observed material overflowing from the top of a Clean Harbors tanker truck.  Organic waste from an RCI hazardous waste storage tank was being loaded to the tanker truck.  The utilities operator contacted the tank farm control room and instructed the tank farm operator to shut off the transfer pump.  The tank farm operator shutdown the pump and responded to the tank truck.  Site Emergency Response personnel were immediately notified of the incident.  The material that overflowed the tanker truck was fully contained in an epoxy-lined, concrete containment sump.  Based on observations from material handling personnel, it is estimated that 100 gallons of hazardous organic waste was released to the containment sump.  The area was isolated and incident responders began washing down the area to the sump.  The released material and water was then pumped to a safe location.  A diaphram pump was used to pump the excess material from the tanker back to the hazardous waste storage tank.  The exterior of the tanker was washed down and the driver released to leave.  Because the material was fully contained and the contents of the wastestream were known, the release did not exceed the reportable quantity.","On 12-4-2013 at 2:00 PM, an incident investigation was held.  The events of the incident were reviewed and discussed.  Based on the results of the incident investigation, the following items were determined to be the causes (direct or indirect) of this incident:   1) The material Information (data) plate was not reviewed prior to the start of loading.  Typically, a 6,000 – 7,000 gallon tanker is delivered to the site to transport waste.  On this occasion, a 4,600 gallon tanker was delivered.  If the requested tanker truck was sent, the overflow would not have occurred.    2) There is a local high level transmitter that is inserted into the tanker truck in order to alert the material handler that the tanker is reaching a high level.  In talking with all personnel present or in the area just prior to the incident, the audible alarm was not heard.  The most likely cause of the alarm not being activated is due to debris in the tank interfering with the movement of the float on the level transmitter.    3) There is a high/high level alarm that includes both visual alarms as well as action alarms.  The DCS computer screen in the tank farm control room indicated the high/high level alarm was activated.  However, the action alarm (which is intended to cutoff the transfer pump) did not work.  During a prior automation software upgrade, the action alarm was disabled on the DCS controlling module.  Therefore, there was no automatic shutoff.

The spill was reported to be coming from tank car AGCX 10153  located on the 30 track adjacent to Shanty road. Upon initial site arrival it was observed approximately 5-10 gallons had been released  with the majority of the product located between 30 track and Shanty road. AGCX 10153 was observed to have the manway open with no manway gasket present. Upon closer investigation it was found that the manway bracket was cracked. This deformation in the manway bracket did not allow the KCS responders to install a manway gasket to the nozzle.     The responders were able to close the manway and tighten all manway bolts tool tight. The non-complying DOT specification packaged was moved a short distance via supervised special switch, approximately 4,500 feet, per 49CFR174.50, to the waybill consigned location for unloading. AGCX arrived at the  unloading location with no further product released. AGCX 10153 has been bad ordered with the car department.    On 12/16/13 the fuel from tank car ACGX 10153 was successfully off-loaded by the KCS diesel shop into an on-site above ground diesel storage tank utilizing the fueling track and standard off-loading procedures. This tank car will be purged and cleaned of hazmat residue, placards removed, appropriately tagged and marked, and then the non-complying tank car will be transported under FRA One Time Movement Approval (OTMA) to car owners home-shop for repairs to manway hinge.    * No injuries reported    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier.

NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.      (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

He failed to unhook the acid transfer pump power cord from the reel.  He then proceeded to plug the extension cord back into the customers outlet so that I could pump the next product.  The customers outlet was directly next to the tanks where the product is located.  after observing that the product was going into the customers tank with no leaks (25 to 30 seconds) he proceeded to walk to the truck to check the connection.  He noticed Hydrochloric acid dripping from the bottom of the box truck. He unplugged the extension cord from the outlet and went to the truck to assess the damage.  The Hydrochloric Acid transfer pump had energized and pumped material into the back of the truck.    The employee began using a garden hose to wash the truck, but discontinued due to low pressure. He notificed the customer, and a decision was made to notify the locadl fire department. They arrived within 2-5 minutes of the phone call.  When the Fire Department arrived they flushed the acid down the storm drain and flushed the area with water for about 30 minutes.

It swerved off the Turnpikeand overturned in a drainage ditch of a grassy shoulder along the east side of the I-35. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) was notified. KDHE notified the Local EmergencyManager who sent the local fire department to the site. To prevent the flow of fuel toward Jacobs Creek(approx 1/4 mile south), the fire dept. constructed a berm along the south end of ditch. A private Emergency Response Contractor arrived at the site on December 7, 2013. They observed that the majority of the fuel had already seeped into the soil. On December 7, 2013, the Contractor dug potholes(12 to 24 inches deep) across the ditch to recover free product. No product was recovered. FromDecember 12 to 13, 2013, the impacted soils were excavated from the site and transported to the Coffee County Landfill in Burlington, Kansas, for disposal; the excavation was backfilled beginning on December16, 2013, and was completed on December 18, 2013. The KDHE was on site during the initial portion ofthe soil excavation. Following the excavation, a field device (flame ionization detector) indicated very lowto non-detect concentrations of diesel fuel in the soil. The backfill and reseeding of the area werecompleted to the satisfaction of the Kansas Turnpike Authority.","Ongoing safety training & preparedness for the drivers, as well as other employees and subcontractors of Pilot TravelCenters.
