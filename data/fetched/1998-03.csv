IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE CAUSE OF THE SPILL WAS CREATED FROM THE DRUM BEING SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO PALLETS OF FREIGHT AND BEING CRUSHED.  THIS COULD HAVE OCCURRED EITHER WHEN THE FREIGHT WAS LOADED OR FROM FREIGHT SHIFTING DURING TRANSPORTATION OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. LOCATION OF SPILL SOUTHBOUND REST AREA ON I-65 & ROUTE 10 IN DEMOTTE, INDIANA.  AMOUNT SPILLED: APPROX < 15 GALLONS SPILLED - TRAILER AND GROUND.  AMOUNT RECOVERED: ONE 85 GALLON POLY-OVERPACK DRUM (30 GAL CONTAINER INSIDE), 2-55 GALLON DRUMS OF SPILL CLEAN-UP, AND 1-55 GALLON DRUM OF USED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND DEBRI. INITIAL CONTAINMENT:  WAS CONDUCTED BY THE JASPER COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENT, THE KEENER TOWNSHIP FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND THE INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION.  THE REST AREA WAS IMMEDIATELY CLOSED AND THE SEMI TRAILER WAS ISOLATED.  INITIAL ENTRY WAS CONDUCTED BY THE KEENER TOWNSHIP FIRE DEPARTMENT IN LEVEL-A PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WITH DECONTAMINATION SET-UP. ABSORBENT PADS WERE PLACED ON THE PERIMETER OF THE SPILLED PRODUCT ON PAVEMENT AND THE REAR OF THE TRAILER.  ENTRY INTO THE TRAILER WAS MADE AND A VISUAL INSPECTION WAS DONE.  IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THIS WAS THE MATERIAL LEAKING AND THE ""CAUSE OF THE SPILL"" SCENARIO.  CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES:  UPON OSI PERSONNEL ARRIVING TO THE SITE PERSONNEL DONNED LEVEL-C PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO CLEAN-UP ALL PRODUCT OUTSIDE THE TRAILER.  THE IMPACTED CONCRETE SURFACE AREA WAS SCRUBBED WITH A WATER & DETERGENT SOAP SOLUTION.  DRY-SORB WAS PLACED TO ABSORB ALL LIQUIDS>  ALL USED DRY-SORB WAS THEN REMOVED AND PLACED INTO DRUMS.  THIS PROCESS WAS REPEATED TWICE. PERSONNEL THEN DONNED LEVEL-B PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND ENTERED THE SEMI-TRAILER (TRAILER AT THIS POINT IT IS CONSIDERED A CONFINED SPACE).  ALL FREIGHT IN THE REAR OF THE TRAILER WAS UNLOADED, STAGED OUTSIDE, AND INSPECTED.  THEIR WERE FOUR PIECES OF ROUND STOCK METAL, ONE CRATE OF A METAL PRODUCT, ONE PALLET OF A SOME TYPE OF A MACHINE, ONE PALLET OF DINNER NAPKINS, AND ONE PALLET OF COFFEE FILTERS IN THE REAR IMPACTED AREA OF THE TRAILER.  THE WOODEN PALLETS FROM THE DINNER NAPKINS AND COFFEE FILTERS WERE REMOVED DUE TO EXCESSIVE CONTAMINATION.  THESE TWO PALLETS WERE REMOVED CUT-UP AND DRUMMED. THE METAL ROUND STOCK WAS DECONTAMINATED BY WIPING IT DOWN WITH A DETERGENT SOLUTION AND DRYING WITH RAGS.  THE CRATE OF METAL PRODUCT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE CONTAMINATED (IT WAS STACKED ON TOP OF THE METAL ROUND STOCK).  THE BOTTOM BOARDS OF THE PALLET THAT HAD THE MACHINE WERE REMOVED AND DRUMMED. THE LEAKING DRUM OF PRODUCT WAS THEN OVERPACKED AND REMOVED FROM THE TRAILER.  THE REAR 12"" SECTION OF THE TRAILER WAS THEN SCRUBBED WITH A WATER AND A DETERGENT SOAP SOLUTION.

CODE 3, INC., ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, WAS IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED OF THE SPILL BY CAMERON COUNTY SHERIFF'S DISPATCH AND TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. BOTH OFFICIALS REQUESTED THAT CODE 3, INC. RESPOND AND MITIGATE THE INCIDENT. UPON ARRIVAL CODE 3, INC. FOUND DIESEL FUEL BEING RELEASED FROM THE DOME LID ON THE TRAILER AND SMALLER LOCATIONS AS WELL. CODE 3, CONTACTED OUR ORGANIZATION, THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE TEXAS NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION COMMISSION. SIMONS PETROLEUM DISPATCHED A TRUCK TO THE AREA TO ASSIST WITH THE FUEL RECOVERY EFFORTS. HOLES WERE DRILLED INTO EACH COMPARTMENT OF THE TRAILER ABOVE THE PRODUCT LEVEL TO PREVENT FURTHER FUEL FROM BEING RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT.

A BERM WAS CONSTRUCTED AND LINED WITH PLASTIC FOR THE CONTAMINATED SOIL TO BE PLACED ON, THEN COVERED WITH PLASTIC TO PREVENT ANY RUNOFF DURING A RAINFALL EVENT FROM CONTAMINATING THE PROPERTY.
