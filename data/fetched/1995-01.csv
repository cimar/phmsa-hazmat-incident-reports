AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE TRANSFER OPERATION, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS OVERWEIGHT AND THAT A PORTION OF THE LOAD HAD TO BE REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE BEFORE IT LEFT THE SITE. THE DRIVER CLOSED AND SECURED THE DOME HATCH AND PRESSURIZED THE TANK IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF THE EXCESS MATERIAL. ONE PRESSURIZED, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT APPROXIMATELY 3 GALLONS OF OIL HAD SPRAYED OUT FROM THE DOME HATCH CONTAMINATING TWO CARS PARKED ADJACENT TO THE VACUUM TRAILER. THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY IN TURN DISPATCHED AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE CREW TO THE SCENE. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SCENE, THE CREW ABSORBED ALL FREE LIQUID FROM BOTH CONTAMINATED VEHICLES AND THE VACUUM TRAILER WITH ABSORBENT PADS. THE CLEAN-UP DEBRIS WAS PLACED INTO STORAGE AT THIS LOCATION FOR SHIPMENT TO A SUITABLE WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITY AT A LATER DATE. A MECHANIC WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND HIS INSPECTION OF THE DOME HATCH WAS PARTIALLY STRIPPED ALLOWING IT TO BE SECURED BY HAND BUT WHEN PRESSURE WAS ADDED, THE FORCE WAS GREAT ENOUGH TO MOVE THE BOLT FAR ENOUGH TO BREAK THE SEAL BETWEEN THE GASKET AND THE DOME HATCH.

UPON ARRIVAL THERE WAS NO FIRE BUT FUMES FROM THE DRUM CONTENTS REACTING WITH THE GROUND, RAIL AND TIRES. INSPECTION REVEAL THAT DUE TO A LOADSHIFT OF AN IMPROPERLY BLOCKED AND BRACED LOAD OF 86 DRUMS OF HYDROFLOURIC ACID (70%) SOLUTION, FOUR LOOSE DRUMS FELL FROM THE TRAILER WHILE TWO OTHERS WERE SUSPENDED IN THE DOORWAY OF THE TRAILER. THESE TWO WERE WEDGED BETWEEN THE SHIFTED CARGO AND THE DOORS THAT HAD BEEN FORCED FROM THEIR LOCKS BY THE SHIFTED LOAD. THE DRUMS WERE LOADED IN THE TRAILER FOUR AT A TIME BANDED TOGETHER. THERE WERE 20 SUCH BANDED GROUPS EQUALING 80 DRUMS. A WALL-TO-WALL BRACE WAS BANDED TO THE LOAD IN A STANDING POSITION. TWO 1 1/2 FOOT PIECES OF 2X4 WERE NAILED TO THE FLOOR HOLDING THE BRACE IN PLACE AND SIX LOOSE DRUMS WERE ADDED BETWEEN THE BRACE AND THE DOOR WITH NO BRACING OR BANDING. DURING THIS PARTICULAR SWITCHING MOVE 5 COVERED HOPPERS, ONE TANKCAR AND SIX OTHER TOFC LOADS WERE INVOLVED. NO OTHER LOADS OR CAR WERE AFFECTED. INSPECTION OF THE INTERIOR OF THE TRAILER SHOWED ABOUT FOUR AND ONE HALF FOOT CARGO SHIFT FROM THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER TOWARD THE DOORS BY THE WHOLE LOAD. FERTECH EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPANY WAS CALLED IN TO HELP CONTAIN THE LEAKING PRODUCT AND SECURE THE RAMAINING LOADS. THE FIRST DRUM HAD SPILLED ALL IT CONTENTS DUE TO BEING CRUSHED UNDER THE MOVING RAILCAR. THE SECOND DRUM WAS DAMAGED BUT NOT LEAKING BY BEING ROLLED UNDER THE FOOT STEP ON THE END OF THE RAILCAR. DRUM THREE AND FOUR ROLLED INTO THE CLEAR AND SUSTAINED MINIMUM DAMAGE. DRUM FIVE AND SIX WERE SUSPENDED IN THE AIR, NO TRAILER FLOOR BENEATH THEM, OUTSIDE THE TRAILER BETWEEN THE LEFT TRAILER DOOR AND THE REMAINING SHIFTED CARGO. THE RIGHT SIDE DOOR HAD BEEN COMPLETELY PUSHED OPEN WHILE THE LEFT DOOR WAS BROKEN LOOSE FROM THE BOTTOM LOCKING DEVICES ONLY. DURING THE TIME THE PRODUCTING LEAKING DRUMS WERE ATTENDED TO DRUMS 5 AND 6, DUE TO THEIR WEIGHT, SLIPPED THE REMAINING DISTANCE TO THE FLOOR OF THE RAILCAR, NOT THE TRAILER, THE IMPACT CAUSING DRUM 5 TO BEGIN LEAKING FROM CRIMPED EDGES. THE EDGES WERE CRIMPED DURING THE TIME THEY WERE CAUGHT BETWEEN THE DOORS AND THE SHIFTED CARGO.
