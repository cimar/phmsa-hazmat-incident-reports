Once completed, the liquid valve was re-opened, allowing contained product remaining above the closed ball, to empty back into the car.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, was notified CHEMTREC Report 2017-01-05-00053.  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a product leak at the connection between the threaded valve and the tank car on the liquid line due to the valve being less than tool tight.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative, Daniel Lopez 281-900-6677.  Contractor personnel removed the liquid valve, inspected and cleaned the valve and liquid line threads, applied thread sealant, and re-installed the liquid line valve.  The leak was secured and the car was released for transport under a OTMA to allow offloading, and subsequent re-qualification of the liquid line valve.

Upon further investigation, he observed that all the shipping labels attached to the packagings had turned to a light orange and there was a bulging drum labeled Oxidizer & Corrosive at the rear of truck. The Veolia driver immediately called his supervisor to report the incident. FCI secured their property by closing gates and sheltered all personnel on site in office building.

BNSF responders were able to stop the dripping by tightening the threaded BOC connection. ECLX 16131 was isolated in the railyard for continued observation.  On 1/09/2014, ECLX 16131 was observed dripping residue commodity again and a containment receptacle placed under the BOV. BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders closed the top operated bottom outlet valve's (TOBOV) operating rod 1/8 turn and retightened the BOC connection. The dripping ebbed to approximately one drop per minute. Contract responders were summoned to assist in ending the commodity drips and secure the BOV-BOC connection. The responders removed residual commodity from within ECLX 16131 which ended any further residue commodity drips. Afterwards, responders cycled the TOBOV and cleaned some debris from the bottom valve seat area. The inside of the BOC was cleaned and the BOC gasket replaced. New Teflon tape was applied to the threaded BOC connection and the BOC was tool tightened. Two disposal drums of removed commodity and contaminated materials were earmarked for appropriate disposal.   ECLX 16131's side stenciling indicated that its last tank qualification was accomplished in the year 2007.   ECLX 16131 was redirected to a qualified repair facility.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and the mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4003,BNSF Railway Company,US,

While performing the inbound railcar arrival inspection on Sunday 1/13/2014, it was discovered that this railcar was leaking on arrival. Upon inspection, it was found that it was dripping very slowly out of the unloading lower valve from the flange where the main valve or lower external valve bolts to the tank of the railcar. A catch pan was put under the leak. We collected product that leaked into pan and found it was about 1 oz. a day of leaked product. We contacted the Shipper (BASF) to notify them of the leaking railcar. We also contacted our local DOT ""Railroad Safety Inspector Hazardous Materials"" contact, Gary Flores. We also took pictures and brought them down to our local fire department in Fremont CA and provided them the MSDS, BOL for the railcar, and the pictures taken. Tom Hervey (State of California Association, Transportation Supervisor Hazardous Materials) was notified by our DOT contact. We also notified the State of California Governor's Office Emergency Services (OES) which in turn provided a control number(14-0252). After the (OES) notice went out to Government agencies, we received a call from Fremont Fire Department (Hazardous Materials Technician) Jacqueline Nomany. Jacqueline Nomany came out to verify the extend of the leak. The Shipper (BASF) scheduled the UTLX maintenance crew to come out and inspect the railcar and see if they can tighten the bolts of the leaking flange gasket and stop the leak. The UTLX maintenance crew was not able to fix the leak, so on Thursday 1/23/2014, the product was transferred out of the leaking railcar into a recently emptied railcar that contained the same product. We will now use the new railcar for future loads. The defective railcar will be shipped out by the Shipper (BASF) who is requesting an OTMA.",At this time I cannot give recommendations do to the failure of this car occurring outside of our facility.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,TRUCK-RAIL HANDLING INC.,US,

While traveling in the left lane, for an unknown reason the driver failed to maintain his lane and departed the roadway left striking a guard rail and subsequent bridge barrier. After crossing the bridge, the transport truck departed the roadway completely and entered the center median causing the transport to roll-over and separated the tractor from the trailer. The tractor rolled over one complete time, and the trailer rolled over and come to reset lying on its side. As a result of the crash the driver sustained multiple blunt force injuries and approximately 300 gallons of diesel fuel was released from the manway hatch of the front compartment on the cargo tank. The spill area impacted an approximate area of 20x30 yards. No waterway was impacted. Duration of release was approximately five hours at an unknown rate of loss. Environmental response team was immediately dispatched to respond to the spilled diesel fuel.

The mail shipment originated in New York (JFKIA) and was accepted by Emirates from the United States Post Office as a mail consignment, under  document number AV-7: US14MOR04024. The parcel was then transported on flight EK206 on January 22nd, 2014 from JFK International Airport to Dubai  International Airport. The shipment was packaged in a way that prevented Emirates’ handling staff from verifying its contents without opening the  parcel. Contents were discovered during a routine x-ray screening of transit mail by the Dubai Police. After Dubai Police opened the package, it was  discovered that the internal containers contained the Dust-off Dusters in original packaging. Hazmat documentation was not provided to Emirates by the  shipper at the time of tender. After classifying shipment as suspect D.G., Emirates contacted the shipper for confirmation of the contents. At which  point the shipper confirmed that the aerosol cans had been shipped in the US Mail in error. The shipment is currently being held in Dubai, until shipper  appoints an agent to perform proper markings, labeling, and documentation. Only after all IATA/ICAO and FAA requirements have been met, the  shipment will be moved to its final destination Djibouti, or returned back to the shipper.","Shipper appears to be a wholesaler operating under Amazon.com.

This was found during an interplant switch move for the customer and tank car was not in possession by CSX. The tank car was isolated. The shipper, Bayer Corporation, was notified directly by yard personnel. Quick Response, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the South Charleston Yard. Quick Response found the bottom outlet valve cap and the bell housing less than tool tight and each were tightened approximately one complete turn each. The shipper representative, Fred McCarty, 304 746-8033 was notified of the situation found. The release was secured and PROX 40410 was released for disposition.

UTLX 207218 was set-out from its train at a nearby industrial track. On 1/13/2014, a BNSF track inspector observed and reported a commodity stain that emanated from the top fitting area of UTLX 207218 while it remained motionless at its current location. Afterwards, inspection by BNSF mechanical responders revealed that UTLX 207218's liquid valve was not fully closed and this valve's closure plug was not in a tool tight condition. The responders closed the liquid valve and tool tightened its closure plug which ended any further commodity release at the closure plug's orifice. Responders wiped spillage from around the liquid valve, atop the valve housing plate and the top side shell of UTLX 207218. On 1/20/2014, contract responders re-inspected UTLX 207218's securement with no exceptions noted.

At approximate mile marker 211.4 the vehicle’s right front steer tire left the roadway and entered the soft shoulder causing the power unit and semi trailer to lose control and travel down an inclined ditch and overturn onto the vehicle’s right side.  The loss of control and subsequent rollover collision caused the semi trailer’s contents to become unsecured. A total of two drums were ejected from the trailer and multiple additional containers within the semi trailer experienced a physical breach causing the release of their contents. An emergenciy response team was summoned, donned the proper personal protective equipment, and remediated the release. Several non regulated containers and one cubic yard container of regulated, packing group III material were remediated, repackaged, and sent to the original designated disposal facility.","Counsel the driver on the importance of being attentive to and aware of road conditions at all times and operating the vehicle in the safest manner that conditions allow.

GMLZ 221 was carefully taken to the facility's containment area for cargo inspection and spill remediation. Contract responders' investigating the leak source within GMLZ 221 reported finding four 55 gallon steel drums with minor cuts/punctures to their sidewalls. Three drums incurred small nicks/cuts under their top lids and the commodity seepage from these small cuts was drying on these drums sidewalls. Damage to these drums was suspected occurring during drum loading. One drum was found with an abrasion cut/puncture at its middle rolling hoop from rubbing against a metal cargo rack inside GMLZ 221. This drum's spillage seeped through the trailer flooring. All four damaged drums were placed into over-pack drums and returned to the lading after the spillage inside and outside of GMLZ 221 was cleaned. On site response was concluded by 1700 hrs.

Juan Corona and Steve Williams responded to the call and went to the location to check out the tank. An ABF employee had reported smelling ammonia. ABF isolated this tank in an empty trailer in a remote part of their yard and blocked off access to the tank. We arrived and used litmus paper to identify the point of the leak, which was very small. We dispatch Airgas Specialty Products field service to the site where the tank was pumped out into a truck designed to pump out ammonia. When the tank was empty and everything was contained, the empty tank was transported back to the Airgas plant in La Mirada. The tank was filled to approximately 325 gallons of ammonia and the amount recovered in the pump out unit was also approximately 325 gallons.","According to the personal who filled the tank, the tank was filled to 85% of fill capacity according to the float gauge on the tank. When field service arrived to pump out the tank, the float gauge was reading 90% which is higher than we fill these tanks. Also there was some corrosion on the relief valve that may have contributed to the leaking tank.

Highland Road,Twinsburg,OH,44087,Carrier,"At approximately 8:30 AM on January 20th, a Univar USA Inc. tractor-trailer was travelling east on the Pennsylvania Turnpike enroute to our facility in Morrisville PA.  The load had originated at our Middletown, PA facility.  In the area of mile marker 306, just west of the Morgantown exit, our driver was forced to brake very hard to avoid a vehicle that abruptly pulled off the road.  During this maneuver, the load shifted towards the front of the trailer.  A 330 gal Intermediate Bulk Container (IBC) filled with a 12.5% sodium hypochlorite solution, pushed forward into the wooden dunnage at the front of the trailer. The IBC was punctured by a board in the bottom third of the container, releasing an estimated 200-250 gallons of material into the roadway, shoulder and adjacent grassy area. There were no injuries.  The PA Turnpike Authority and Univar activated a spill response contractor (Lewis Environmental Inc.) to provide cleanup services.  The spilled hypochlorite was picked up by absorbents and the impacted soils excavated into a roadside stockpile.   An estimated 40 tons of vegetation and soils were excavated. The final site restoration is pending improvement in weather conditions.","The Univar investigation has identified the following corrective measures:  -Purchase of additional securement load bars and straps,  -Refresher training for Univar operations employees.",Yes,IBC,"For liquids, when stacked",31H1,Yes,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,23676,Univar USA Inc.,US,

Webster  Rd. Dekalb, IL. He was delivering #2 clear diesel and had never been  there before. He went inside and Julie that work there told him to put  it into tank # 1. As he started to pump the load off, he went out and  looked to make sure everything was going good and it was. When the first  compartment went empty ( 3000 gallons ) is when he noticed the large  spill ( 2010 gallons ). When he first read the tank he wrote down 3'.  The previous driver that had just left wrote down 26'-3"" for his ending  reading. Mike read the tank wrong and thinking it would fit. The  location then sent him to another bulk plant to finish unloading because  it would not fit there. There was no overfill alarm on the tank, and no  containment for the tanks as they were double walled. The diesel ran off  the cement pad and onto a large ice cover area.    Update - I spoke to Julie at the site the day of incident - She state  the that driver did come in and talk to her. She informed him that tank  #1 and Tank #3 both were clear diesel tanks and that he would need to  get a reading prior to deliver. She also stated that the overfill  alarms were going off both flash light and sound. I also spoke with the  IL EPA contact that was on site yesterday and he tested the overfill  alarms and they were working appropriately.","Action Taken:   Trans Environmental, 815-885-4840, came to clean up the spill. They had  a vac truck and a pickup and trailer full of supplies. They arrived at  11:45 AM and left at 2:00 PM All the puddled product was cleaned up.  Some snow / diesel was put into large totes. The tanks and surrounding  area would have to be cleaned up at a later date do to the weather.  There was some frozen soil involved which they said would have to be  scraped. David Myroth with Conserve FS (815-703-7915 ) is in charge of  the cleanup.    Root Cause:   Mike failed to read the guage properly and failed to notice the tank was  over filling.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,10000,Klemm Tank Lines,US,

The IBCs were to be delivered to Alpha Omega Recycling Inc. located at 315 Whatley Rd in Longview, TX.  While in transport, our driver Mr. Raymond Lee, advised he was in heavy traffic on I-20 in a construction zone just prior to Little Rock, Arkansas when he had to brake harder then usual to avoid hitting a car. Mr. Lee stopped at a truck stop to get fuel for his truck when the leak was discovered.  Mr. Lee contacted his dispatcher and advised of the situation. At some point in the conversation with Mr.Lee and his dispatcher information was exchanged and the dispatcher believed that this was not a active leaking container. Mr. Lee was then told to drive to a clean-up contractors location approximately 15 miles away. Mr. Lee proceeded to Rineco to obtain assistance with the clean-up stopped along the side of Vulcan Road which is beside Rineco. A clean-up crew from Rineco arrived on location and began to attend to the leaking IBC.  It was determined that a IBC had shifted and a load lock handle puncture the IBC causing the leak.  Approximately 100 gallons of material had leaked and was recovered during the clean-up. After the clean occurred the tractor trailer delivered the remaining materials to Longview TX. There were no injuries or evacuations associated with the incident.","Both the Drive and Dispatcher have received discipline. They both have been scheduled for specialized retraining.

They could not find any issues with the washout cap or gasket so they thought maybe there was a crack on the neck of the washout port.

THEY ALSO CUT INTO THE SIDES OF THE TRAILER AND BROKE THE SEAL AT THE REAR OF THE TRAILER FOR ACCESS. AFTER THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED, THE LEXINGTON FIRE DEPARTMENT ENTERED THE TRAILER, FINDING SEVERAL BOXES OF SCORCHED BEGGING, PILLOWS, AND OTHER ITEMS.  PICTURES TAKEN AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT INDICATE THAT SEVERAL ITEMS WERE REMOVED FROM THE TRAILER DURING THE RESPONSE. THE LEXINGTON FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORT NOTES THAT THE TRAILER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE IGNITION, AND THAT THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE IS UNDETERMINED. HOWEVER, A REPORT FROM THE LEXINGTON POLICE DEPARTMENT DOES NOTE A SUSPECTED SOURCE OF IGNITION: ""FIRE PATTERNS SUGGEST THAT THE FIRE ORIGINATED AT FLOOR LEVEL IN AN AREA WHERE MULTIPLE PALLETS OF USED NI-CD/RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES WERE PLACED FOR TRANSPORT. AFTER OBTAINING A COPY OF EACH BILL OF LADING, THE ONLY POSSIBLE IGNITION SEQUENCE COULD HAVE AND/OR WOULD HAVE BEEN FROM THE BATTERY AREA."" THE LEXINGTON FIRE DEPARTMENT THEN RELEASED THE VEHICLE TO UPS FOR CLEAN UP AND DISPOSAL, THE CONTENTS WERE RELOADED INTO THE TRAILER, AND THE TRAILER WAS TOWED BACK TO THE LEXINGTON UPS FREIGHT TERMINAL. THE FOLLOWING DAY, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL SPILL RESPONSE CONTRACTORS, THE TRAILER WAS UNLOADED AND SEVERAL PALLETS OF USED BATTERIES OF VARYING CHEMISTRIES WITH EXTENSIVE FIRE DAMAGE WERE FOUND IN THE AFFECTED AREA. THE CONSENSUS FROM THE RESPONDERS AND UPS MANAGEMENT ON SCENE WAS THAT THE FIRE HAD ORIGINATED FROM A PALLET CONTAINING LEAD-ACID BATTERIES, THOUGH THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WHICH CAUSED THE BATTERIES TO IGNITED COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.

LOCATED AT 2325 NORTH LOOP ROAD AMES, IOWAW 50010.  I ARRIVED AT 10:50 AM AT WHICH TIME I WAS MET BY A WORKER, WHO OPENED THE GATE FOR ME.  THIS WORKER WENT BACK TO PLACING A SIGN ON THE TANK MARKING IT AS SULFURIC AICD, I ASKED HIM IF THEY HAD FROOM FOR MY LOAD OF SULFURIC ACID AND IF THEY HAD THE OTHER HALF OF THE FLANGE.  WE DRIVERS DO NOT CARRY FLANGES ON OUR TRUCK AND I NEEDED THIS PART TO HOOK MY 2"" HOSE TO THEIR TANK HE WAS NOT SURE SO HE WENT INTO THE OFFICE AND I MET MICHAEL DEJONG, WHO WAS SIAD TO BE THE HEAD PERSON IN CHARGE.    I TOLD MICHAEL DEJONG I WAS THERE TO DELIVER A LOAD OF SULFURIC ACID AND I NEEDED A WAY TO HOOK UP TO THEIR TANK.  MICHAEL AND I WENT INTO THE SUPPLY ROOM AND FOUND A 2"" COUPLER THAT WOULD WORK TO OFF LOAD FROM MY TRUCK INTO THE SULFURIC ACID TANK.  BOTH MICHAEL DEJONG AND I PLACED THE NEW FITTING ON THEIR SULFURIC ACID TANK.  AT THIS TIME I SHOWED MICHAEL THE BILL OF LADING AND THE CERTIFICATE OF ANALYSIS AND HE SIGNED MY COPY.  AFTER SIGNING MY BILL OF LADING, I ASKED MICHAEL DEJONG IF THEY HAD ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE LOAD OF SULFURIC ACID.  MR. DEJONG SAID ""OUR TANK IS A 3000 GALLON TANK AND THERE IS 500 GALLONS OF SULFURIC ACID IN THE TANK"".  I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD ABOUT 2000 GALLONS AND ASKED HIM IF IT WAS OKAY TO UNLOAD, MICHAEL DEJONG SAID ""GO AHEAD"".    I HOOKED UP THE 2"" HOSE FROM MY SULFURIC ACID TANKER ONTO THEIR SULFURIC ACID TANK AND OPENED THEIR VALVE.  AFTER OPENING THE VALVE ON MY TANKER I WALKED OVER TO THE CONNECTION AT THE BIOVA SULFURIC ACID TANK, THATS WHEN THE TANK STARTED TO SHAKE.  A CLOUD OF GAS STARTED DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE BIOVA SULFURIC ACID TANK AND I RAN BACK TO MY TANK TO SHUT OFF THE VALVE.  WHILE SHUTTING OFF THE VALVE I WAS OVER TAKEN BY THE GAS.  THE VALVE WAS NOW CLOSED SO I HEADED INTO THE BIOVA OFFICE TO INFORM MR. DEJUNG THAT THERE WAS GAS COMING OUT OF THEIR SULFURIC ACID TANK AND IF HE WAS SURE THAT IT WAS SULFURIC ACID IN THE TANK.  MICHAEL DEJONG REPLIED ""THERE IS HYDROCHLORIC ACID BUT THAT'S OKAY THEY ARE COMPATIBLE ACIDS.""  I SAID ""NO THEY ARE NOT, YOU NEED TO COME AND SEE THE CLOUD OF GAS, I NEED HELP!""  I LEFT MICHAEL DEJONG AND WENT OUTSIDE TO SHUT MY TRUCK OFF AND TO CALL MY BOSS.    I CALLED CHRIS BALTUSHIS (MY BOSS) HE ASKED IF 911 WAS CALLED AND IF NOT WE NEEDED TO CALL THEM NOW.  MICHAEL DEJONG CAME OUT OF THE BIOVA BUILDING AND TOLD ME THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON THE WAY.  CHRIS ASKED ME WHO AUTHORIZED ME TO UNLOAD THE LOAD OF SULFURIC ACID, I TOLD HIM THAT MICHAEL DEJONG AUTHORIZED IT AND AT THIS TIME HANDED MR. DEJONG MY PHONE.  MICHAEL DEJONG TOLD CHRIS THAT HE AUTHORIZED ME TO UNLOAD THE SULFURIC ACID INTO THEIR SULFURIC ACID TANK.    THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED AND MICHAEL DEJONG ASKED THEM TO GIVE ME MEDICAL TREATMENT.
