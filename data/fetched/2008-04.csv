The van was temporarily remediated in order to move it across the street into the Veolia permitted facility where the leaking container could be safely handled and prepared for disposal.  A crew of six Veolia hazmat employees managed the cleanup at the temporary 10-day intransit yard where the van had been parked.  Upon arrival at the Veolia disposal facility, a crew donning Level C PPE began removing drums from the shipment to retrieve the leaking container.  A leaking 20 gallon white poly drum was identified with most of the liquid leaked from it.  It was discovered that the drum had a nail-sized hole at the bottom of it.  The drum was flipped upside down to stop the leak and then overpacked.  The van was cleaned with hidry until all visible signs of waste were removed.  It appears the direct cause was the small hole in the bottom of the drum that might have been caused from the loading of the van or the load shifting during transport.  The generator was contacted to discuss possible prevention of reoccurance.  Veolia environmental personnel were contacted to make notifications/reports to the TCEQ.   The van was pressure washed to remove acid from inside the van floor and the under carriage.","The local Veolia operations teams have been reminded to inspect all pallets for nails, etc. prior to loading.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2000,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

It is known that there are UN1719, UN1993, UN2922, and UN3266 on board the trailer.  After speaking with the driver I have found that there the material has not dripped onto the ground and the release is contianed within the trailer.   The Kansas City fire department and hazmat team is now on site.  KC Fire Dept/Hazmat has assumed control of the scene at this time.  They have decided that they would like to be the first to enter the leaking trailer.  Since there is no MSDS sheet with the driver, the hazmat team will be sampling via a HazCat kit.  Once the material has been determined, the network contractor will then be allowed to assess the situation.   The contractor has indicated that the material released is High Shine Purple Dressing UN1993 PGII Class 3.The damaged container was 3 rows back from the trailer door and had released material over the trailer floor.  Given that the released material was a class 8 the floor needed to be washed down.  The trailer contents were removed and the floor was cleaned.  The network contractor indicated that it seemed that the package was loaded damaged.  On the bottom of the container there appeared what seemed to be a razor cut.

TILX 290308 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard, awaiting a detailed inspection. BNSF contract responders inspected TILX 290308 the morning of 4/06/08 and determined that the product release emanated from the 75 psi pressure relief device (PRD). Preliminary inspection of the PRD revealed no visual defects. The secured manway lid was opened and responders noted two inches of product outage inside TILX 290308; therefore concluding that TILX 290308 was in an overfilled condition which caused the PRD to expel liquid product during movement. On 4/07/08, the BNSF contractor assisted the shipper in reducing 983 gallons of product into a tank truck via the bottom outlet valve without further incident. The contract responders disassembled the PRD, cleaned and reversed the PRD O-rings since the face of one O-ring had some flat spots. The reassembled PRD was tested using a nitrogen blanket induced inside TILX 290308 with no vapor release observed at the internal pressure of 20 psi. The spillage on TILX 290308 was wiped and it was released to proceed to its destination by approximately 1415 hrs. MDT, 4/07/08. No ground impact from this product release was evident.","Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the adherence of proper product outages for anticipated ambient temperatures, as well as, the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.",No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3533,BNSF Railway Company,US,

It was found that the top vent was leaking the material.  The fire department plugged the leak and no more material had been released.  It is estimated that a total of 40 gallons of bleach were released onto the concrete surface (not soil as originally thought)and traveled 15ft into a nearby storm drain.  The material does not seem to have migrated far from the site.  A vac truck will be utilized to remove the product from the storm drain.

The driver heard a “popping” noise coming from the hopper, he moved away from the truck to investigate.  The driver and two other employees noticed smoke billowing from the hopper.     Immediately he discontinued fueling the truck and moved the truck approximately 40 feet away from the fueling station and offloaded the waste that was in the truck onto a concrete slab.    The area that was on fire was near the cab of the truck, which means that it was one of the last loads placed into the truck. Immediately water was applied to the burning area. It was noticed that there was one metal cylinder that was the cause of the fire.     After removing the metal cylinder the load was spread out to search for more. A total of 6 cylinders were located. The markings are Scott, Oxygen Generating, Serial numbers 00023928, 00023927, 00023931, 00023952, 00023920, the unit that burnt no longer had any markings. Fearing further fires all of the units were placed into a drum of water.    After a brief internet search it was clear that these units are aviation oxygen generating units. Phone calls were immediately made to the DOT, FAA, TSA, and ultimately to the Department Homeland Security to find someone to report this to. In the end the Federal Aviation Administration Office of Security and Hazardous Materials office was reached.     On 4-18-08 at approximately 9:00am David Murphy and Kevin Fitzpatrick of the US Department of Transportation Federal Aviation Administration Office of Security and Hazardous Materials arrived. They took statements and said that the investigation on the dumping of these unites would start.    On 4-21-08 at approximately 11:00am the two investigators mentioned above along with Bob Burns and Sean Lynum from the US Department of Transportation Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration continued the investigation.

GATX 22283 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard with a receptacle placed under the BOC to catch drippage. BNSF contract responders and a BNSF mechanical responder inspected GATX 22283 finding the top operated bottom outlet valve's (TOBOV) operating rod in a partial open position. Responders closed the TOBOV, taking two full turns to do so. Also, the BOC was found less than tool tight. During the tightening of the BOC, responders reported some resistance; but once it was tightened beyond the threaded area of resistance, an additional 3-4 turns fully tool tightened the BOC. After securement was completed by 1730 hrs. CDT, 4/03/08, product drips ceased. The spillage collected in the catch receptacle (approximately two gallons) was neutralized.

Driver pulled to the shoulder of the highway, and determined leak was coming from trailer.  Fire, police, Univar managmement personnel arrived at the scene.  Representatives from City of Dallas public works, TXDOT, and EPA also arrived.  Fire department used absorbent materials to contain the flow of material.  Independent hazmat response team was contracted by Unviar to respond, clean, and remediate the spill.  Containers from trailer were decontaminated along with the trailer itself.  Material from failed container was transferred into another suitable container. Cleaned materials were placed in another Univar trailer and both trailers returned to Univar facility.  Emergency response contractor removed contaminated soil for disposal, and replaced.  This cleanup plan was reviewed and approved by the City of Dallas and EPA representatives.      Incident was determined to be caused by failure of load locking bar inside trailer.  When bar failed, it caused the IBC to shift inside the trailer.  The IBC struck the front wall of the trailer, and cracked along the side corner.",Load locking bars and all load securement devices will be inspected before use and any devices in need of repair will be serviced or removed from use.

When doing so the employee failed to check whether the tank car's primary and secondary liquid product fitting valves were in the closed position, prior to pressurizing the tank car.  The Mr. Marinaccio then proceeded to establish connections on the trailer's end (e.g., apply loading tube and apply the transfer hose), when doing so the H2SO4 Acid then began to discharge from the transfer hose uninhibited and Mr. Marinaccio was splashed when the H2SO4 deflected off the side of the CCC trailer.  The H2SO4 Acid came into contact with Mr. Marinaccio's chin area and the back of his neck.  Once the employee was splashed with acid, he panicked and immediately descended from the transfer rack without shutting off either the tank car's product valve and the air pressure going into the tank car.  Another Transfer Operator - Greg Hepfer who was working in the vicinity on another transfer track heard the commotion and immediately donned this PPE and proceeded to investigate the situation; Mr. Hepfer made the radio call to alert the his fellow team members of the spill and immediately went up to the top of the car and saw that the product (primary & secondary) valves were in fact in the open position.  Mr. Hepfer then immediately closed the valves and the product began to stop discharging.  Mr. Hepfer then proceeded to rinse off the CCC trailer and establish the trailer connection to purge the residual product from the transfer lines.   By 7:00, facility's Emergency Response Plan was fully activated, and onsite personnel then began the process of containing and remediation the spill, by utilizing sodium bicarbonate to neutralize and dike off the spillage.  The National Response Center and PADEP were notified of the incident and Emergency Response/Environmental Contractor - React Environmental handled the cleanup efforts and removal of ballast.  Approximately 250 Gallons of Sulfuric Acid spilled on the CCC trailer #181, asphalt aisle way in between transfer tracks # 2 and three, corresponding ballast and also onto two adjacent DuPont TiO2 tank cars ACFX 71636, DUPX 80238.      Mr. Marinaccia sustained a 2nd degree chemical burn to the back of the back of his neck; and was treated and evaluated the physician at Concentra Medical Center located at 7000 Holstein Ave Philadelphia, PA   19153 (215) 365-7510.  Mr. Marinaccia was prescribed a pain medication and was released back to full duty the proceeding day (Tuesday 4/22).","• The involved employee shall be disciplined (e.g., company performance improvement process) for his negligence in complying with standard operating procedures for transferring Sulfuric Acid from tank car -to- tank truck.    • Savage's Management shall evaluate the present skills and knowledge of Philadelphia's operational staff to ensure that individuals are complying with the applicable transfer procedures.    • Savage shall accelerate the implementation of their operating procedural (administrative; transfer; equipment) training program, this includes: educating the employees on the specific standards and steps in the procedure; administer procedural exams and proficiency/competency exercises.

The area around the rail car was isolated.  Chemtrec (report number 2008-04-11-00030) assisted in contacting the shipper, DSM Chemicals North America.  DSM dispatched a response crew to the scene and found that the container was releasing nitogen and possibly cyclohexanone vapors from the manway cover gasket area.  DSM personnel advised that they pressurize the car with nitrogen when off loading at their facility.  DSM  personnel opened the manway cover to inspect the gasket for defects.  After taking no exceptions, they closed the cover, and properly tightened the fasteners.  The car was tested for securement then released to destination.  Approximately one pound of vapor was released into the atmosphere.

The car was isolated and Marsulex, Chemtrec, the Riverdale Fire Department, National Response Center and Illinois EMA were notified (CHEMTREC Report #2008-0423-00083, NRC report # 868821, IL EMA report # H2008-0537). SunPro Environmental Services, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the 4 bolt flange on the top of the liquid line leaking.  Sunpro personnel tightened the flange and observed leaking product from the bottom of the modified spool piece after the bolts were made tight.  All bolts were secured and tool tight.  A pressure gauge was placed on the vapor line and found pressure steady at 2 psi. Contractor personnel decontaminated the car and immediate ground area of spilled material. The leak was secured and the car released for transport. This incident did require a special switching move.

No injuries or waterways were involved. The liquid was described as clear and had a strong odor. Mr. Rodriguez stated the outbound load was still releasing at a rate of one-half gallon per hour. The amount on the ground and the cause were unknown. Mr. Rodriguez advised a ten-inch puddle of product pooled on the dirt. Tom Robinson, Manager of Hazardous Materials, was notified, stated he would follow up with Mr. Rodriguez, advised a contractor would be dispatched, and requested RMCC notify Thomas Carmichael, Senior Special Agent, to provide site security until the contractor arrived. Agent Carmichael was notified stated he would investi9ate the incident, and advised he would follow up with Mr. Rodriguez. State regulatory agencies were notified within the prescribed time parameters.   UPDATE: At 10:42 AM, Tom Robinson,   Manager of Hazardous Materials, was contacted, stated the bulletined was isolated, and advised he was en route with a two hour ETA.   Mr. Robinson further stated United States Environmental Services, Contractor, was en route with a one hour ETA. Mr. Robinson advised the release did not appear to be due to damage to the bulktainer. Mr. Robinson requested RMCC have the shipper contact him. John Stein, Chemtrec, was notified and stated the shipper would contact Mr. Robinson. UPDATE: At 01 :10 PM, Tom Robinson.   Manager of Hazardous Materials advised he was on scene, estimated that approximately one gallon of product was on the ground, and the release was contained and slowed to a drip. Mr. Robinson further advised the container was missing the external bottom outlet valve and a contractor was searching for a new valve.   UPDATE: At 05:11 PM, Tom Robinson, Manager of Hazardous Materials,   advised there was no leak from the bottom just a dripping of condensation, and the leak on the top was repaired by changing gaskets   on the valve flanges and properly closing the butterfly valve.

The Trailer was immediately pulled out to the yard and door opened for ventilation. Saety Manager Jeff Turner,CHEMTREC, and the shipper where all contacted. NRC Environmental was called in to handle the spill & clean up.  NRC Report:  NRC Environmental Services (NRCES) was called by Conway Freight to a possible flammable liquid spill in the back of a Conway Freight trailer (3176651) April 11, 2008. Conway Freight personnel noticed a strong odor in the trailer as it was being unloaded. NRCES was called to investigate the source of the odor and clean up any spill if necessary.  NRCES used Level C PPE and a four-gas meter during the investigation of the odor. NRCES found that one, five-gallon pail of Carboline #2 Thinner (Flammable Liquid) was damaged and had leaked an estimated two to three gallons of material. NRCES overpacked the damaged pail of material. NRCES then re-palletized the rest of the material that was on the pallet. The material that had spilled from the drum had evaporated shortly after leaking from the pail.

During the night fire department got a call complaining of an odor something like burning plastic. Fire department responded and evacuated the hotel. The hotel was searched for two hours with no results. Fire department went outside and began searching the nearby truck stop for something that may be leaking, when they spotted ammonia trailer. Testing was done with a Drager tube and a reading of 10 ppm was found under the truck. Truck was moved to a separate area and valves were opened in an effort to search for leak. Per Fire Department testing, with a Drager tube, testing resulted in an initial reading of 20 ppm which quickly disappeared. State Police conducted further inspection on the trailer and then released to destination. Further inspection at Massey's Tank facility in Phoenix, AZ, resulted in no leaks found.

PROX 82980 was in the process of being unloaded, the unloading pipes where ripped from one liquid and one vapor line. The chlorine unloading rack emergency shutdown system operated along with the PROX 82980 liquid line excess flow check valve and an employee of HK Krevit company donned personal protective equipment and closed the liquid and vapor line valves on he tank car. The New Haven Fire Department and Hazardous Material Team responded, and found two railroad employees and eleven personnel at the HK Krevit Company, (six Krevit employees and five outside contractor employees) requested medical treatment for possible chlorine exposure, and two employees from Patient Care Services at Leeway (across the street from the Krevit Company) requested medical treatment. None of the persons treated were hospitalized.  Air monitoring conducted by Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection at the facility found no traces of chlorine vapors inside facility or near the tank car unloading rack. CT-DEP allowed personnel to return to work and allow CSX, FRA and emergency response personnel to review the site and inspect the tank car valves and fittings for proper securement.  PROX 82980 was re-spotted at the unloading rack at 22:30 hours, April 17th, 2008.

The car was isolated and shipper was notified. CSXT dispatched a response contractor, Eagle Construction + Environmental Services, Inc. (ECESI), Findlay, OH. Upon inspection of UTLX 500010 evidence of a liquid leak was noted on both sides of the tank emanating from within the loading valve protective cover. ECESI personnel broke the seal, and liquid was noted about the threads of the liquid line valve. The liquid line valve appeared closed, i.e. 90 degrees to the valve body, with handle against its stop. ECESI, using an 18 inch pipe, turned the plug for the liquid line valve less than 1/8 turn and the leak ceased. CSXT personnel moved UTLX 500010 to and fro and again insepcted UTLX 500010. ECESI personnel removed the plug for the liquid line valve and noted the entire chamber between the top of the ball valve of the liquid line valve and underside of its plug to be full of toluene. This product was collected by ECESI personnel. CSXT personnel set the car over the spill pan in the Willard Terminal. ECESI returned April 26, 2008 to inspect UTLX 500010. The car was again moved to and fro, and ECESI personnel reported liquid present above the ball valve. Marathon Petroleum Inc. was advised of this, and arranged for delivery of a replacement valve to Specialized Professional Services, Inc. (SPSI). SPSI personnel replaced and leak tested of the replacement valve on April 28, 2008 with no exceptions noted.

Facility personnel immediately donned appropriate protective equipment and initiated appropriate response procedures.  Upon identification of the damaged container, it was determined that a 55 gallon steel drum had developed a small puncture.  During transportation, the  load movement allowed the liquid to escape.  The response crew collected all spill material using a suitable absorbent material and disposed of it into a 55 gallon drum.  The leaking drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon salvage drum.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Regional Enterprises, was notified via CHEMTREC Report 2008-04-22-00150.  CSXT's trainmaster stopped the release by tightening the bottom outlet valve cap.  SWS Services, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that the bottom operating handle for the bottom outlet valve was not pinned in the closed position allowing the operating handle fall and open the bottom outlet valve. Contractor personnel secured (pinned) the operating handle in the closed position and ensured the bottom outlet valve cap was wrench tight. The leak was secured and the car released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move.

Approximately 4740 pounds of NH3 liquid escaped from the tank through the damaged pressure relief device as vapor into the atmosphere.  The remaining liquid in the tank auto-refrigerated below the boiling point of NH3 and no additional product was released.  Because of the decisive actions on the scene by another Grammer Industries, Inc. driver, the remaining product was able to be transferred to another cargo tank to prevent further release of the product.      The temperature of the anhydrous ammonia that was loaded in the tank was estimated between 0° and 40° Fahrenheit as evidenced by the frost forming on the tank and associated piping (cold shock see note 5 in 49 CFR 173.315(a)(2)).   The cargo tank was subjected to extreme temperature swings because of this “cold shock” loading.  The differences in the expansion and contraction rates for steel versus aluminum may have contributed to the elongation of the bolted connections and “cold shocking” the trailer would only exacerbate this condition.      The cargo tank was designed with three baffle assemblies.  The rear most baffle assembly’s lower curb side bracket that was attached to the baffle bracket through a bolted connection and attached to cargo tank wall on a pad failed in bending fatigue, resulting in a series of events that ultimately caused the failure of the rear most re-closing pressure relief device.  After the initial failure of the lower curb side bracket, the fore and aft movement of the liquid in the tank created a twisting motion on the upper curb side bracket attachment.  The result was a flexing and swinging motion of the baffle assembly, causing the transfer of high bending stresses and an exaggerated twisting motion to the baffle assembly’s upper (curb side) baffle attachment bracket.  The baffle’s upper bracket then failed primarily due to a combination of bending fatigue and shear type failure.     Once the upper and lower baffle attachment brackets failed, the baffle assembly was then free to “swing” fore and aft with the motion of the liquid in the cargo tank with the driver side upper and lower attachment points acting as hinges on a door.  The repeated contact between the relief valve spring and the baffle assembly eventually led to the failure of the relief stem in the pressure relief device.  The failure of the stem was caused by a bending fatigue crack growth from constant impact of the baffle assembly.  When the stem finally failed, this resulted in the release of liquid anhydrous ammonia to the atmosphere through the failed re-closing pressure device opening in the top of the cargo tank.","1. Modify the baffles to reduce the possibility that a baffle assembly could make contact with a re-closing pressure relief device if the attachment of the baffle assembly to the cargo tank wall failed.    2. Modify the inspection procedure to include the inspection of the baffle clips, weld attachments and bolt holes and bolted attachments for fatigue cracks, loose bolts or elongated bolt holes.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7150,,,

He then removed the seal plug on the unloading line on the bottom of the car. At this time a small amount of caustic drained out of the unloading line and into a bucket. The unloader noticed that caustic continued to drip out of the line for about one minute. Heverified again that the internal tank valve was closed and noticed that caustic was still dripping. He then replaced the seal plug on the tank car. The only way that caustic could continue to drip was because both the internal valve and the external ball valve leaked passed the seals.In order to safely unload the caustic car, Rescar was called in to install two additional external ball valves to the bottom of the tank car. Using the two new valves, SCA Tissue was able to safely unload the caustic tank car.SCA Tissue was not able to determine the cause of the failure with the valves due to the limited access tothe valves.

After the mechanic changed out the battery, he placed an unserviceable tag on the used battery and placed it on the forward cargo bin door threshold. At that time, he was called to complete the NAV data and OPC data loads. The Data loader was not working correctly so it required the mechanic to perform a bench load which took longer than expected. When the mechanic completed the data loads, he performed his walk around and did not notice that the battery was still there or that the belt loader had been there.

Upon arrival , the driver was instructed to lower the bulk bin from the transport vehicle.  While lovering the bulk bin from the transport vehicle, approximately one gallon of liquid escaped from the top seal of the bulk bin onto an area of soil adjacent to the off-loading area.  Facility personnel immediatley seured the container and proceeded to remove the contaminated soil. All collected spill material was containerized and disposed of along with the contensts of the bulk bin.","The non-secification bulk bin utilized for the transportation of the material in question is designed for the safe transport of liquid solid mixtures (sludges).  At the time of loading, the load was inspected and all closures were intact and no evidence of leakage was observed.  It is believed that upon arrival at the disposal facility, liquid that was incorporated into the sludge at the time of loading separated out of the material and the presence of this liquid and the angle at which the bulk bin was being lowered to the ground allowed a small amount of liquid to pass through the top seal of the package. It is susspected that the cloure loosened slightly during transportation allowing the lquid to pass between the gasket and closure device. In order to prevent a recurrence, drivers will continue to inspect each package accepted for transportation and insure all closures are adequately closed and take all appropriate actions should a closure loosen during transport to prevent an unintentional release.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

Upon arrival, the driver prepared to pump off the load into an above ground tank. He got his hoses hooked up with the safety pins in the pressure hose, he opened all the valves, vents and the tank valve. After all connections were made, the driver engaged the PTO and ran the rpm’s up to 900. He then got out of the truck and was proceeding toward the belly valve area. As he got to the pump, the hose slid off it’s fitting. The driver ran to the PTO and shut down, then to the belly valve and shut down, then to the loading head and shut down and finally the tank valve and shut down. He saw that the hose had a loose clamp. He put the hose back on the fitting to catch any remaining fuel. At that time he called dispatch and started the remediation process immediately.  *The hose used in the pump off was a brand new hose. The hose should have been able to withstand the pressure.  Gra-Kat arrived on site and met with the local fire department. Personnel from Gra-Kat utilized a vacuum truck to collect the material. An asphalt area approx. 300 feet by 3 feet wide had been impacted by the release. The crew deployed granular absorbents to the freestanding fuel, worked them in with brooms, and secured them in a dump truck pending disposal.

What Happened? On Friday, 4/18/08, around 1100 a Crowley employee at McGrath started the Jet fuel truck to warm it up for use later and it ran for about an hour.  The Crowley supervisor came out of the office around 1410 and walked over to the truck to start deliveries, at which time she saw fuel leaking from the truck.  She could not stop the leak, so she placed a bucket under the point where the fuel was running to the ground and then commenced to transfer the fuel to the Crowley truck adjacent to the leaking truck.  Terminal personnel used a barrel pump and an electric pump to recover about 80 gallons of fuel, which was in two barrels on site.  They placed absorbent boom and pad at the perimeter of the puddled fuel.  After all the free liquid was removed, they backed the truck out and placed absorbent pads on the spill area. The spill site is a slab of ice approximately 8' wide and 20' long, where the truck has been parked during the winter.  The ice slab sits below the prevailing grade in the area and is surrounded by snow berms.  They could get very little additional fuel using absorbent pads to wipe the ice.  The response was complete and the area was secured at around 1700.      An incident response team deployed to McGrath the following day.  The team excavated several spots in the snow around the perimeter and used absorbent pads to wick up any fuel at the base of the snow, but got little or nothing.  They drilled through the ice slab and again tried to wick up any fuel that might be lying under the ice, but got little or nothing.      At this point, we consider the clean up to be complete, subject to soil sampling this spring to confirm that indeed no fuel flowed off of or underneath the ice slab during the spill.     Subsequent inspection of the truck revealed that the water drain pipe running from the tank roof gutter down through the product tank and out the bottom of the tank had a crack.  The likely cause was water freezing in the pipe during the spring thaw/freeze cycle, which was unknown to the operating personnel until the spill occurred.",> Park truck in warm storage when possible.  > Keep roof of tank clear of snow and ice.  > Phase out tank trucks with this design.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2900,"Crowley Petroleum Distribution, Inc.",US,

On Impact, our truck became fully engulfed in fire from leaking diesel fuel and leaking drums of waste flammable liquids. 98% of all hazardous materials being transported were consumed in the fire. The other truck overturned but did not catch fire and was not transporting any hazardous materials. Neither driver survived the crash.  There were 8055 gallon drums from 22 different shippers on our truck. The majority of the hazardous materials were paint related material.  Many of the drums failed with the initial impact, others failed as a resuft of the intese heat from the fire. The fire burned for approximately 6 hours.
