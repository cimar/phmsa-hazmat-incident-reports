THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A RURAL STRETCH OF HIGHWAY 487.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH COMPANY PROCEDURES, THE DRIVER TELEPHONED POWER RESOURCES, INC. (PRI) AS SOON AS THE LEAK HAD BEEN DETECTED.  PRI PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE SCENE WITH SPILL CLEAN-UP MATERIALS AND RADIATION MONITORING EQUIPMENT.  IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 3-5 GALLONS OF LIQUID SPILLED ONTO THE PAVEMENT NEXT TO THE HIGHWAY.  DUE TO THE HOT TEMPERATURE, THE LIQUID QUICKLY EVAPORATED.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT VIBRATION PROBABLY CAUSED RESIDUAL WATER TO COME OUT OF THE MATERIAL, WHICH THEN LEAKED THROUGH A HOLE WORN IN THE PLASTIC LINER AND THROUGH THE RUBBER GASKET ON THE REAR DOOR.  THE DRIED MATERIAL ON THE PAVEMENT WAS CLEANED UP AND SURVEYED WITH MONITORING EQUIPMENT.  THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO PERSONNEL INVOLVED AT THE SCENE, THE PUBLIC OR THE ENVIRONMENT.  THE MINOR AMOUNT OF MATERIAL WHICH LEAKED WAS MANY TIMES LESS THAN THE RQ ( REPORTABLE QUANTITY OF 0. 1 CI). IN ORDER THAT THE SHIPMENT COULD PROCEED TO THE DESTINATION, BENTONITE WAS ADDED TO THE REAR OF THE DUMPSTER TO SEAL THE LEAK AT THE REAR DOOR.  THE SHIPMENT CONTINUED ON THE REMAINING 12 MILES OF TRANSPORT WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL INCIDENTS.  PRI PERSONNEL FOLLOWED CLOSE BEHIND TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL LEAKAGE.

The outer box was marked, labeled and had the following attachments: the top of the box had the shipper's declaration for dangerous goods attached to the top. Side 1 of the box had a flammable liquid label. Side 2 of the box had orientation arrows only. Side 3 of the box had orientation arrows and these markings (ltd. qty., UN1263, Paint). Side 4 of the box was marked (UN1263, to: Acorn Windows Systems, 42 Cole Street, Quincy MI 48202). The bottom of the box had the following manufacturer's seal: Chesapeake fiber packaging, Hunt Valley, MD. Upon inspection of the inner package, the following was found: 1 metal receptacle with a friction type closure. There were no positive means to secure the closure which resulted in a loose closure allowing approximately eight ounces of a one quart receptacle to leak.
