LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND WASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (DOT) CALLED TO SCENE.  STATE DOT ASSUMED COMMAND AND REPORTED INCIDENT TO THE WASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGY (DOE).  DUE TO A LESSER AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT SPILLED ONTO ROADWAY AND HEAVY RAIN WAS IMMINENT AT THIS TIME, NO ACTION WAS TAKEN TO CLEANUP ROADWAY.

DOME WAS SECURED, BUT WAS NOT TIGHT ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE LEAKS WHEN THE LIQUID MATERIAL SURGED AGAINST IT.  THE CAUSE WAS THE DRIVER'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY THE DOME COVER ON THE CARGO TANK AFTER LOADING THE MATERIAL. CARGO TANK WAS RETURNED TO OUR TERMINAL AFTER UNLOADING AND INSPECTED BY A QUALIFIED MECHANIC, HIS CONCLUSION IS THE CARGO TANK IS IN PROPER WORKING ORDER AND NO REPAIRS WHERE REQUIRED.

AFTER ASSESSING THE SITUATION I CONTACTED CHEMTREC, PER CN POLICY, AT 2130, THE CHEMTREC INCIDENT REPORT NUMBER IS 05252003015, I STATED TO THEM THE SITUATION WAS UNDER CONTROL AND NO OTHER RESOURCES WERE NEEDED.

THE CONNECTION ON THE TANK END WAS REINFORCED WITH RUBBER BUNGIE CHORDS.  AFTER CONNECTIONS WERE MADE AND FILLING COMMENCED, THE TRUCK WAS LEFT UNATTENDED.  AS STATED BY MR. DURNEZ, ""PUMP VIBRATIONS CAUSED THE EARS TO MIGRATE TO (THE) OPEN POSITION AND (THE) OFF-LOAD HOSE BUILT ENOUGH PRESSURE TO COME LOOSE.""  INITIALLY THE DRIVER INDICATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 500 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL WERE RELEASED, AND AN UNKNOWN CALLER MADE A 911 CALL.  HAZMAT RECEIVED A CALL NOTIFYING THEM OF A SPILL AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30 AM.  THE FUEL FOLLOWED THE GRADE OF THE LOT EAST APPROXIMATELY 46 FEET TO  A STORM WATER WASH THAT RUNS ALONG THE WEST SIDE OF SANFORD STREET.  THE FUEL FOLLOWED THIS ""GUTTER"" SOUTH TOWARDS HIGHWAY 6 & 50 APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET.  RAINY CONDITIONS AIDED IN WASHING ALL OF THE FUEL ALONG THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE, LEAVING BEHIND LITTLE RESIDUE.  CONTAMINATION THEN PROCESSED TO FOLLOW GRAVITY TO A STORM WATER DITCH RUNNING ALONG HIGHWAY  6 & 50, FLOWING WEST.  BECAUSE OF RAINY CONDITIONS, WATER WAS PRESENT IN THE DITCH AND ACTED AS A BARRIER BETWEEN THE FUEL AND SOIL (DIESEL FUEL LAID ON TOP OF THE WATER).  UPON ARRIVAL, HAZMAT WAS ON SITE AND HAD CONTAINED THE DIESEL RELEASE WITHIN THE STORM WATER DITCH BETWEEN HIGHWAY 6 & 50 AND THE ACORN STATION BY CONSTRUCTING A SAND DIKE.  THE SAND DIKE WAS LOCATED ADJACENT TO AN I-70 SIGN IN FRONT OF THE WEST GATE INN.  A MAKESHIFT OIL/WATER SEPARATOR WAS CONSTRUCTED WITHIN THE DIKE USING A LENGTH OF 4"" PVC THAT WAS LAID AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER.  THE LOW END WAS SUBMERGED IN THE CONTAMINATED SIDE OF THE DIKE, AND THE HIGH END EMPTIED INTO THE UNAFFECTED SIDE OF THE SAND DIKE.  ALONG THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE DITCH FROM THE STAND DIKE TO SANFORD STREET, FREE PRODUCT COULD BE SEEN ON THE WATER SURFACE.  A VERY STRONG ODOR WAS PRESENT. RAINBOW MOUNTAIN SERVICES (BOB) ARRIVED ON SITE BY REQUEST OF D. SOPOCI AT APPROXIMATELY 1:15 PM.  THE DEWATERING PROCESS BEGAN ON THE IMMEDIATE WEST SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE WHERE A CULVERT IS LOCATED.  APPROXIMATELY 6,000 GALLONS WERE REMOVED FROM THIS LOCATION, CAUSING WATER ON EITHER SIDE TO FLOW TO THIS POINT.  A SECOND SAND DIKE WAS LAID AT THIS TIME ABOUT 15 FEET FROM THE EAST SIDE OF THE ENTRANCE TO ISOLATE EACH SIDE OF THE DITCH, WITH THE ENTRANCE ACTING AS THE HALF WAY POINT.  DEWATERING CONTINUED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE DITCH, AND MOVED TO THE EAST SIDE ONCE MOST OF THE WATER WAS REMOVED FROM THE WEST.  ONCE DEWATERED, WATER AND PRODUCT WAS ALLOWED TO SEEP FROM THE DUTCH WALLS, POOL AND WAS REMOVED.  THE DEAWTERING PROCESS RESUMED UNTIL 8:00 PM, WHEN ALL OF THE RECOVERABLE WATER AND FUEL WAS REMOVED FROM THE DITCH.
