SHE WAS SOUTHBOUND ON US 119 JUST NORTH OF LOGAN, WV, WHEN SHE CROSSED THE CENTER LINE AND NORTHBOUND LANES AND DROVE OFF THE ROAD.  THE TRUCK CAME TO REST ON ITS SIDE IN A DITCH.  ONE OF 2 PACKAGES CONTAINING RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS WAS EJECTED FROM THE TRUCK.  IT CONTAINED 4 X 200 uCi 123I DIAGNOSTIC CAPSULES PACKAGED INSIDE A FIBERBOARD BOX.  THE BOX WAS FOUND INTACT IN THE SNOW ABOUT 30 FEET BEHIND THE TRUCK.  THE OTHER PACKAGES WHICH HELD 2 X 9.9 mCi 201 T1 THALLIUM CHLORIDE SOURCES WAS FOUND INTACT IN THE TRUCK.  THREE DIFFERENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS RESPONDED TO THE ACCIDENT SINCE IT WAS UNCERTAIN IN WHICH FIRE DISTRICT THE ACCIDENT HAD OCCURRED.  THE INJURED DRIVER WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE TRUCK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AND WAS TRANSPORTED TO A HOSPITAL. THE EMERGENCY SERVICES PERSONNEL MISSED THE FACT THAT THE DIAGNOSTIC CAPSULES WERE SOLID AND SUSPECTED THAT THE PACKAGE BEHIND THE TRUCK WAS LEAKING SINCE ONE SIDE OF THE BOX WAS WET FROM THE SNOW.  FOR THIS REASON, THEY CLOSED BOTH NORTHBOUND LANES FOR A SHORT TIME.  ONE NORTHBOUND LANE WAS REOPENED AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE HEALTH PHYSICIST FROM MALLINCKRODT MEDICAL WHICH WAS THE SHIPPER.  THE MALLINCKRODT HP ARRANGED FOR RADIOLOGICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARLESTON AREA MEDICAL CENTER.  THE AGENCIES OR ORGANIZATIONS CONTACTED OR INVOLVED WERE AS FOLLOWS:  LOGAN COUNTY EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICE AUTHORITY, VERDUNVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT, LOGAN GENERAL HOSPITAL, MALLINCKRODT MEDICAL, INC., THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, CHEMTREC, STATE RADIOLOGICAL AGENCY, STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT, NRC REGION 11, CHARLESTON AREA MEDICAL CENTER, ASSOCIATED COURIERS, INC.  THE HEALTH PHYSICIST AND THE RADIATION SAFETY OFFICER FROM THE CHARLESTON AREA MEDICAL CENTER ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND PERFORMED RADIATION LEVEL SURVEYS ON THE PACKAGES.  THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE PACKAGES HAD NOT RELEASED ANY RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS, WRAPPED THE BOXES IN PLASTIC AND PACKAGED THEM FOR TRANSPORT TO C A M C FOR DISPOSITION.  THE HP AND RSO SURVEYED THE INSIDE OF THE TRUCK AND SURROUNDING AREA AND THE AREA WHERE THE 123 1 PACKAGE HAD BEEN FOUND.  ALL AREAS WERE AT BACKGROUND LEVELS.  ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL AREAS WITHIN THE TRUCK AND THE PACKAGE SURFACES WERE WIPE TESTED FOR LOOSE CONTAMINATION.  THE WIPES WERE ANALYZED AT C A M C AND FOUND TO BE AT BACKGROUND LEVELS.  THE SCENE WAS CLEARED BY EMERGENCY SERVICES PERSONNEL AT 9:30 AM.  EMERGENCY SERVICES PERSONNEL WERE SURVEYED AT LOGAN GENERAL HOSPITAL AND WERE FOUND TO BE FREE OF RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION.  SUMMARY: A PACKAGE CONTAINING A RADIOACTIVE MEDICAL PRODUCT WAS EJECTED FROM A TRUCK WHICH WAS DRIVEN OFF A ROAD INTO A DITCH.  ANOTHER RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL PACKAGE REMAINED WITHIN THE VEHICLE.  NO RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL WAS RELEASED FROM EITHER PACKAGE.

THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY INFORMED THE SHOP MECHANIC AND RETURNED TO THE VEHICLE WHEN HE HEARD TWO QUICK EXPLOSIONS AND SAW A FLASH OF FIRE AT THE REAR OF THE TRAILER.  BEFORE THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT COULD EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES, THE REAR PORTION OF THE TRAILER WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED.  AN INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE FIRE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE UNIT BEING SUBSTANTIALLY OVERFILLED.  SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVERFILL.  A MALFUNCTIONING LIQUID LEVEL GAUGE PROVIDED FAULTY INFORMATION TO THE AUTOLOAD SYSTEM.  UPON OBSERVING LIQUID OXYGEN BLOWING FROM THE MAIN VENT, THE OPERATOR CEASED THE FILLING OPERATION AND OFF-LOADED PRODUCT UNTIL IT STOPPED VENTING LIQUID.  THE UNIT WAS WEIGHED, HOWEVER, THE LIQUID LEVEL WAS STILL TOO HIGH.  ONE HOUR LATER WHEN THE DRIVER ARRIVED, LIQUID OXYGEN WAS BLOWING OUT OF THE ROAD RELIEF VENT.  LIQUID OXYGEN AND VAPORS SATURATED THE CABINET AREA CAUSING THE TIRES TO FREEZE AND EXPLODE.  THE RESULTING SHOCK WAVES MAY HAVE IGNITED THE OXYGEN-RICH ENVIRONMENT.

UPON ARRIVAL TO PICK UP THE BOX FOR TRANSPORTATION, THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX WERE INSPECTED FOR CONSISTENCY AND CAPACITY.  THE CAPACITY WAS APPROXIMATELY HALF FULL (10 CUBIC YARDS) AND THE CONSISTENCY APPEARED TO BE SOLID.  UPON QUESTIONING PLANT PERSONNEL AT YOUNG GALVANIZING, OUR DRIVER WAS TOLD THE WASTE IN THE BOX WAS SOLID, WHILE BEING A LITTLE DAMP. ADDITIONALLY, THE PROPER SHIPPING NAME WAS HAZARDOUS WASTE SOLID, AND IN SECTION J OF THE MANIFEST, THE PHYSICAL STATE IS NOTED AS BEING SOLID. THE BOX WAS ICKED UP WITHOUT INCIDENT AND TRANSPORTED TO THE DISPOSAL FACILITY IN CINCINNATI, OH.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE FACILITY, BOTH GATES WERE CLOSED PROHIBITING ACCESS INTO THE FACILITY.

ON A DOWNGRADE OF ROAD, A TRAFFIC LIGHT HAD TURNED RED AND UPON STOPPING, THE LOAD IN THE BOX SLID FORWARD ON THE PLASTIC BOX LINER, PUSHING LIQUIDS UP TO AND OVER THE FRONT OF THE BOX BETWEEN THE BOX AND TARP AND ONTO THE GROUND.

PERMISSION WAS GRANTED TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL WHICH WAS COMPELTED BY CLEAN HARBORS PERSONNEL.  IN RETROSPECT, THIS WASTE MATERIAL SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PUT IN AN OPEN TO 20 YARD ROLLOFF BOX, BUT RATHER A CLOSED TOP BOX WITH A METAL LID WHICH WOULD CONTAIN LIQUIDS, RATHER THAN A TARP.
