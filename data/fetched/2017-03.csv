During transport, 4 of the IBC's began to leak this residue past the dust caps. The driver noticed the release while trans-loading the material to another trailer. The driver immediately segregated the material, placing it in a containment area. Absorbents were deployed under the suspect valves.

The waybill listed the cargo as Hazardous Material (UN1263  PAINT). In the interest of safety, the unit was placed on hold and moved to the containment pit. JB Hunt was contacted and immediately dispatched Kary  Environmental Services for the required response and remediation. the attached Cargo Report contains photos and seal change information.  Upon arrival, Kary Environmental observed a thick, white substance coming from the container  above the tires. The majority of the product was dry.  However, some product was slowly dripping onto the tires. The interior inspection revealed palletized units containing (5) gallon pails of Paint/Primer  (Hazardous Flammable Liquid / UN1263). All cargo consisted of this same product and was stretch wrapped to the pallets. The palletized units were  stowed in two rows and one layer in height, with the pails stacked (3) high. The source of the leak was identified on the rear pallet at the left sidewall. Two  of the pails stowed at the upper layer, had one small hole each; slowly leaking Paint/Primer. It appears the holes were created as the pails rubbed  against the A Track anchor on the container sidewall.  Securement consisted of Air Bags at the rear and midpoint. Additional rear securement included upright pallets at each stack, secured with wood floor  blocking and a lumber load bar. Kary Environmental completed the clean up and remediation. Approximately (2) gallons (total), leaked from the two pails.  The leaking pails were overpacked and transported to Kary Environmental. The unit was released for outage.

The Water Treatment Operator immediately investigated and shut a valve going to the bleeder pot and notified the IMTT Operations Supervisor. IMTT was in the process of loading a ship on Pier A from Tank 4006 and bypassing Pump 9 to flush the line after just coming back into service. The IMTT Operations Supervisor called the IMTT Operations Manager to inform him of the situation. The IMTT Operations Manager responded to the area to start investigating and oversee the clean up process.  It is unknown at this time who opened the valve into the bleeder pot. The IMTT Operations Manager and Assistant Manager have spoken to the Operations Supervisor whom oversaw the work on Saturday to get the line back into service.  US Ecology (IMTT's OSRO) was called to perform the cleanup operations which were completed by the end of the day. The NRC and the USCG were both notified of the incident due to PHMSA Regulations. The USCG sent a crew of 4 to investigate and they were satisified with our efforts to clean up.,IMTT conducted an investigation to determine why the bleeder valve was left open.

The shipper, Sun Products Corp, was notified (CHEMTREC Report #2017-0310-00213).  Marion Environmental (MEI), a CSX response contractor, was dispatched to the scene to assess the car.  MEI found the car actively releasing product vapors upon their arrival.  MEI reported that during the derailment the tank cars protective housing sustained an impact which caused the pressure plate bolts to fail.  This allowed vapor to release from between the cars pressure plate and tank shell nozzle.  Because tank car repair cost were estimated to exceed the value of the car; the car was set over from the tracks and subsequently cleaned and purged on site in preparation to dismantling.

The tank car was isolated and the shipper Citgo,  were notified via Chemtrec, report # 2017-03-25-00104.Environmental Management Specialists (EMS), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the Terminal and found a slow active release from the Bread Box area on top of the tank car.    The breadbox was opened and the release was emanating from the liquid line valve area. In an effort to stop the active release the internal pressure was relieved by opening the vapor line valve. The release stopped once the internal pressure was relieved and the valve was inspected. The liquid line plug was removed and the internal valve was inspected for proper working condition. The ball valve opened and closed with no visual defects. The securement plug was inspected and all threads appeared in proper condition. The securement plug was re-secured with thread sealant applied to the threads. No root cause for the release was determined at that time. The Shipper, Citgo, Darnell Parker (630) 257-4252 was notified of the conditions found.    CSX Hazmat decided to return to the tank car on Monday, March 27, 2017 to perform a further inspection. Nitrogen was added to the tank car to increase the internal pressure and inspect the tank car for the root cause of the release. Upon an increase of internal pressure it was discovered that product was escaping around the internal ball valve and the gasket.     The Shipper, Citgo, Darnell Parker (630) 257-4252 was notified of the conditions found and both CSX and Citgo decided the liquid line valve needed to be replaced as soon as possible to avoid any additional product release. Sunpro, a CSXT response contractor and AAR certified mobile repair facility was contacted and advised they had an exact new replacement valve. Sunpro was mobilized to the Terminal to replace the valve and perform a field bubble leak test to re-qualify the tank car for transportation.

OUR DRIVER CLAIMED HE WAS GOING ABOUT 10 MPH AS HE WAS DOING THE TURN.  THE SLOSH EFFECT AT THIS POINT IS WHAT CAUSED THE CARGO TANK TO FLIP ON IT’S RIGHT SIDE. AT THIS POINT, PRODUCT STARTED TO ESCAPE FROM THE VENT PIPING. OUTLET VALVES, INLET VALVES, INTERNAL BELLY VALVE AND ALL OTHER EXTERNAL PIPING AND ATTACHMENTS REMAINED INTACT AND NO OTHER VISIBLE DAMAGE INCURRED. APPROXIMATELY 11,100 LBS. OF NITROGEN ESCAPED, BUT EVAPORATED VERY QUICKLY INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. NO PROPERTY DAMAGED TO THE ROAD OR INJURIES RESULTED FROM THE SPILL, NOR HAZ-MAT WAS RELEASED INTO A WATER WAY OR STREAM. THE NITROGEN SIMPLY EVAPORATED AND NO CLEANUP WAS REQUIRED, OTHER THAN THE DAMAGED VEHICLES. THE CARGO TANK OUTER SHELL GOT SCRAPPED, DAMAGED AND BENT. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE INDICATION THAT THE INNER TANK BROKE OR RUPTURED, BUT WITHOUT CERTAINTY. THE TANK HAS A BOLTED MANHOLE COVER AND AFTER A FEW HOURS AFTER BEING ON ITS SIDE, IT STARTED TO SHOW FROST AROUND THE SEAL ON THE MANHOLE COVE, BUT IT REMAINED INTACT. DUE TO NOT KNOWING THE INTEGRITY OF THE INNER TANK, WE PUMPED THE REMAINDER OF THE PRODUCT WHICH WAS ABOUT 33,300 LBS. OF NITROGEN ONTO A DIFFERENT CARGO TANK TO HAUL AWAY. AFTER THE NITROGEN WAS PUMPED OUT, THE VEHICLES WERE TURNED UPRIGHT AND TOWED AWAY TO OUR YARD. THIS CARGO TANK HAD A LOT OF DAMAGE TO THE OUTER SHELL, IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE UNKNOWN INNER TANK DAMAGES. THEREFORE, WE HAVE DECIDED TO DISPOSE OF HIS TANK AND PLACED IT OUT OF SERVICE. IT’S NOT SALVAGEABLE, THE DAMAGES AND REPAIRS EXCEED THE VALUE OF THE TANK.

Mingo Rd.,Tulsa,OK,74116,Shipper,"On March 16th 2017 AALA offered a Passenger Service Unit (PSU) containing an oxygen generator for air transportation on FedEx AWB 720035551342 from Tulsa, Oklahoma to Flushing, New York (LGA). The undeclared PSU was accepted and transported on FedEx Cargo without properly being declared for transportation.         All Passenger Service Unit (PSU) panels containing or not containing an oxygen generator, as well as oxygen generators are flagged as hazardous materials in the Inventory system and flagged forbidden for shipment in the American Airlines hazardous materials shipping system  - HazRaps.  As required by American Airlines Policy and Procedures the required yellow caution tag “Caution Contains Oxygen Generator” was on the part as well as the green hazardous materials (HM) sticker on the outside of the non-specification fiberboard box that contained the PSU panel for storage purposes.   Load Center Continued Maintenance Visit (CMV) received an AOG request to pull PSU from stock for shipping to LGA.   TUL Shipping/Receiving picked up the box containing the PSU from CMV and delivered to Tulsa Warehouse Shipping/Receiving for shipment to LGA.   The box containing the PSU was not placed in the designated hazardous materials area in the TUL Warehouse to be sent to TUL Control Materials Storage (CMS) for dangerous goods processing.   The box was placed in the FedEx shipping area and was input in the FedEx shipping system for processing pick-up by FedEx.   It appears the American Airlines employee working the FedEx area did not open the box to verify the part per procedure, nor noticed the green HM sticker on the top of the box, the yellow caution tag inside the box or pull the part up in the Inventory System to see the yellow hazardous materials banner.    Shipping/Receiving does not identify what employees work in a specific area on a given day, so a specific employee could not be identified who was working the FedEx machine on 3/16/2017.","American Airlines Tech Ops Supply/Stores Director provided the below recommendations/actions regarding the oxygen generator shipment.      The result of the AA root cause analysis determined the following causal factors.    · The load center (CMV) described above processed the shipping paperwork (transfer between AA locations).  This shipping paperwork is the finial internal shipping document when the product is within the inventory system and delivered direct from the load center to the shipping dock for processing.      · The aircraft on ground (AOG) desk material logistic specialist (MLS) shipper did not observe the HM label on the exterior of the box or the paperwork internal to the shipping box.  If the MLS would have identified the HM sticker label and paperwork, the box would have been properly labeled and therefore would have been properly shipped.    · The MLS shipper was current on all the training requirements.     Action: Tulsa Stores will implement two additional training days day one will cover “49CFR Haz by Ground  - MX01797” and “IATA Haz by Air  - MX01796”.    Action: Tulsa Stores will provide a designated area within shipping identified for the staging of HAZMAT materials.

During transit on a sharp curve, the liquid propane load shifted, causing both units to roll to the right. Both units continued to roll and struck a barbed wire fence and a tree before coming to rest on their side in the SB ditch of FM 1447 facing SE. Law enforcement, fire personnel, emergency management and operations personnel arrived at the scene and remained there during the road closure for approximately twelve hours. Dewitt Emergency management claimed a vapor/gas leak from the pressure relief valve on the rear top which may have been possible if the vessel was sideways and the liquid placed pressure on the spring and caused the valve to open a bit to relieve pressure but there is no evidence of this occurrence. DPG personnel arrived three hours later to transfer the propane to their tank #T205. The pressure relief valve was tightened upon their arrival. Once it was 40% offloaded, the wreckers were able to connect to the tank and held it at a better angle to complete the rest of the offloading. Operations personnel found no leaks or damages to the valves during this time. The product was hauled to DPG's yard in Seguin, TX and was stored there for about 4 days. Then, the product was picked up at DPG and a second transfer was done from tank T205 to GIGO's tank #GTK010. The tank was inspected, and there was no damage found to the pressure relief valves, nor bends or cracks in the springs. There is no evidence of a liquid spill and the exact loss of product could not be determined, as it was not weighted after the first transfer. However, based on the weight scale receipt after the second transfer, it is possible the 693 gallons were lost during the transfers and not due to a valve failure.  There was also, a spill of about 25 gallons of motor oil and antifreeze from the engine of the tractor, which was cleaned up by CTI a few days later.  Tank and tractor were towed away. No injuries or fatalities reported.","Additional training on Cargo Tank/Truck Rollover prevention has been provided for the drivers to help improve and enhance their consciousness, by sharing online tools offered by the FMCSA.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,71422,GIGO Transport,US,

Local police and fire department were called and closed the roadway. An emergency response team was also called to clean up the oil spill from the roadway and edge of the road.  The cargo tank had been washed out and repair work completed on it by a third party vendor and had been released back into service with the washout caps left off and dome lid not secured. When the driver stopped at the intersection, the product sloshed out of these openings.  An area approximately 4' x 20' x 18"" of contaminated soil was excavated and removed for disposal. Excavation was refilled with new soil. The trailer was cleaned up, caps and dome lid secured.",Proper procedures were reviewed with the vendor on closing and securing washout caps and closures after wash out and repairs are completed.

DRIVER RETURNED NEXT DAY, ON DAY OF INCIDENT, WITH ANOTHER DELIVERY TRUCK UNIT THAT HAD A 50’ LONGER DELIVERY HOSE ON THE HOSE REEL; OR A TOTAL OF 150 COILED DELIVERY HOSE ON REEL. DRIVER POSITIONED UNIT, UNCOILED THE 150’ LENGTH OF DELIVERY HOSE FROM REEL IN ORDER TO REACH THE TANK. CONNECTION WAS MADE WITH DELIVERY NOZZLE FROM DELIVERY HOSE INTO TOP FILL PORT OF RECEIVING TANK.     DRIVER INITIATED ACTIVATION OF TRUCK PUMPING SYSTEM TO EFFECT FUEL DELIVERY AND WAS RETURNING TO A POSITION HEAR THE RECEIVING FUEL OIL TANK WHEN HE OBSERVED FUEL OIL PRODUCT SPRAYING OUT THE END OF THE DELIVERY HOSE THAT CONNECTED TO THE TRUCK REEL/PUMPING MECHANISM. DRIVER RETURNED TO THE REAR OF HIS UNIT AND SHUT DOWN THE TRUCK PUMP TO STOP THE OFF-LOADING PROCESS. THE TRUCK PUMP METER REFLECTED THAT 49.5 GALLONS HAD BEEN DISCHARGED THROUGH THE PUMP AND AS SUCH THIS IS THE GALLON AMOUNT WE CONTRIBUTED TO THE MAX TOTAL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SPILLED. DRIVER POSITIONED ABSORBENT MATERIALS HE HAD ON TRUCK IN POSITION AND THEN EFFECTED CALL INTO OUR OPERATIONS GROUP. CALL WAS MADE TO LOCAL 911 WHICH RESULTED IN MIAMI TOWNSHIP FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDING TO SITE TO CONTAIN THE AREA. WE PLACED NOTIFICATION CALLS TO NRC, OHEPA. AND CLERMONT COUNTY LEPC AS WELL.     AS LOCATION WAS VERY CLOSE TO OUR CORPORATE OFFICE; TWO SAFETY DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO SITE. UPON ARRIVAL AT SITE, MIAMI TWP. F.D.

A METAL CULVERT PIPE WAS POSITIONED UNDER THE RESIDENCE DRIVEWAY AND FED OUT SEVERAL FEET INTO DITCH-LINE AND FREE PRODUCT WAS OBSERVED ON THE OUTSIDE PARAMETER OF THE PIPE ALONG GROUND LEVEL. WE DETERMINED THE NEED TO ADDRESS EXCAVATION ALONG AND UNDER THE METAL CULVERT PIPE IN THE DITCH-LINE IN ORDER TO PROPERLY RE-MEDIATE THE SPILLAGE AND WE RETAINED SUPERIOR ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS (SES) TO RESPOND FOR FURTHER SITE RESPONSE AND REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES. SES WAS ONSITE WITHIN TWO HOURS AND INITIATED ADDITIONAL INITIAL RESPONSE AND WAS ABLE OVER A COUPLE OF DAYS COMPLETE THE REMEDIATION OF THE SITE TO ACCEPTABLE STANDARDS.     INSPECTION AT SITE AND FOLLOW-UP INSPECTION OF THE TRUCK DELIVERY UNIT AT OUR REPAIR FACILITY REFLECTED THAT THE DRIVER HAD UN-COILED THE ENTIRE 150 FOOT OF DELIVERY HOSE FROM TRUCK PUMP HOSE REEL AND IT WAS DETERMINED THE HOSE END ATTACHED TO THE HOSE REEL FAILED. THE RUBBER END OF HOSE IS WEDGED INTO THE SLEEVE WITH A FERRULE, IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT THE HOSE CAME UNCOUPLED AND LET THE PRODUCT ESCAPE. REPAIR TO OUR UNIT INCLUDED REPLACEMENT","THE COMPANY REVIEWS ALL INCIDENTS TO DETERMINE CAUSATION AND ADDRESS IF THE INCIDENTS WERE PREVENTABLE OR NON-PREVENTABLE. IN THIS INCIDENT, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TWO AREAS OF CONCERN WERE NOTED. ONE, THE INTEGRITY OF THE AREA OF THE PRODUCT HOSE WHERE THE HOSE IS CONNECTED TO THE PUMP REEL AND THE RUBBER HOSE WEDGED INTO THE SLEEVE WITH A FERRULE. THE OTHER WAS THE CONTRIBUTORY ACTION OF THE DRIVER UN-COILING THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE DELIVERY HOSE FROM THE DELIVERY HOSE REEL OF THE TRUCK UNIT.   AS TO THE FIRST; INSPECTION OF THE COMPONENTS DID NOT SHOW ANY EXCESS WEAR, CORROSION OR ALIKE THAT WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SITUATION, NOR WERE THERE SIGNS OF ANY PRIOR LEAKAGE AT THE CONNECTION AREA OF THE HOSE TO THE REEL. DISCUSSION WAS HELD WITH OUR MAINTENANCE GROUP AS TO THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL PROPER PROCEDURES ARE UTILIZED DURING THE INSTALLATION – CLAMPING/TIGHTENING ASPECTS WHEN REPLACING A DELIVERY HOSE ON THE REEL MECHANISM.     AS TO THE SECOND; DISCUSSION HELD WITH DRIVER AS TO PROPER DELIVERY PROCEDURES AND THE NEED TO MINIMIZE THE PULLING OF THE DELIVERY HOSE AND PROCEDURE TO NOT COMPLETELY UNCOIL THE HOSE ON THE REEL DURING THE DELIVERY PROCESS.  ALL DRIVERS RECEIVE TRAINING IN PROPER PROCEDURAL PERFORMANCE OF ALL JOB FUNCTIONS INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED TO THE DELIVERY PROCESS.

The employees departed the location and traveled in separate vehicles from the lease site along FM 2915, before turning southwest onto FM 230 and shortly afterward, onto County Road 3495. Mr. Bathe was in the lead vehicle and arrived at the next lease site (C.T. Adams - Oil Lease #026715) first and proceeded to the service location (C.T. Adams #2, operated by Layline Petroleum LLC). The lease gate had been left open because the pumper was on-site gauging tanks. As the RSI delivery driver approached, Mr. Bathe observed that the chemical transfer hose had become disconnected from the transfer pump and that chemical appeared to be flowing from it. He quickly ran over to the tote of RSI-101 on the bed of the delivery vehicle and immediately closed the valve, which had been left open by the driver, Mr. Ward. Approximately 125 gallons of chemical had spilled along several hundred linear feet of lease road and a small portion of CR 3495, creating an impacted area of 5-600' long by 1' wide (max) and no more than 1/4"" deep.  The duration of the spill was anywhere from half a minute to a minute, and appeared to have started approximately 60' in advance of the lease entrance on CR 3495. No traffic was present at the time and no individuals were injured or impacted by the spill, nor were any waterways or inland water bodies affected. The spill site is located in a predominantly rural and sparsely populated area which is also used for cattle grazing; no residences were observed on the lease property and grazing cattle did not come into contact with the spilled product. After surveying the nature and extent of the spill, Mr. Bathe proceeded to contact his supervisor (Terry Johnson) and the RSI Health and Safety Manager (Robert Menser), followed by the contract pumper (Keith Krenek), who notified the lease operator. The RSI Health and Safety Manager contacted the RSI Environmental Manager (Karl Mueller) at 0948 hours on March 30, and an emergency response/remediation contractor (Cleaning Solutions, Inc of Bryan, Texas) was dispatched to the site to perform clean-up activities. Two Cleaning Solutions personnel arrived at the site at around 1330 to begin the initial response, which consisted of absorbing and removing any remaining free product using a cellulose-based product (Sphag Sorb). Two 55-gallon drums of spent sorbent materials were generated as a result of this activity. The crew then used a trailer-mounted pressure washer and water tank to apply a water-based solution of Micro Blaze - a blend of nutrients, wetting agents, a","The direct cause of the incident was the use of an old O-ring gasket which prevented a secure seal between the hose connector and pump fitting and allowed the hose to be jarred loose while in transit. Contributing factors were inadequate pre-trip planning because the truck was not supplied with any spare gaskets. The incident root cause was due to two separate violations of internal company policy and DOT regulations. Leaving a hose connected to an IBC is not allowed due to the extra weight and stresses placed on the valve, which could cause it to fail by compromising its physical integrity.  In addition, however, the valve was left open, which resulted in a spill when the hose became disconnected.
