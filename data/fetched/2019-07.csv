Passenger did not disclose that he checked a bottle of DCT Oven Cleaner (UN1814 Hazard Class: Class 8 Corrosive UN 1814 Quantity Size: 1 liter). Passenger was questioned by customer service agent prior to checking his baggage whether hazardous materials were present and he stated he did not have any hazardous material.  Upon arrival in LNY and during the off-loading of baggage from the aircraft, LNY Ramp agent Kekai Biho, informed his supervisor that while unloading checked luggage from the cargo area he observed a box to be wet and smelled a strong unknown chemical odor from the area.  When he lifted the box, a bottle fell from the box which he determined to be oven cleaner and notified the flight crew.  The entire 1 liter bottle of oven cleaner leaked throughout the cargo hold of the aircraft. LNY AARF was called to the scene to assist in cleanup and ARFF was unable to provide cleanup assistance and the aircraft is currently down due to corrosive spill of undeclared hazmat in a passenger checked bag Aircraft is awaiting MX inspection/cleanup. Aircraft was out of service for 4 hours.

It was discovered that customer’s process of loading drums included the use of a 5 gallon pail which was marked and labeled to be used for the appropriate materials, was possibly used for the wrong material by an inattentive employee.

After receiving the call, the local management team notified the driver to pull over immediately and inspect his load. After pulling over to a safe and secure location, the driver found wet residue on the body on the tank vehicle leading from the roof of the tank vehicle near the man-way. Further investigation by the driver uncovered that the washout cap on the roof of the trailer had not been properly secured and was in the fully open position. Absorbent material was immediately put down to contain the spent product. An in-house response crew responded to the spill, donned the appropriated PPE, and cleaned up the spill. Spilled material and absorbent materials used to remediate the spill were properly packaged, marked, and labeled and sent for disposal.","An internal investigation into the spill incident revealed that the washout cap had not been properly secured by the shipper’s loading team. Due to the shipper’s facility rules, 3rd party drivers are not allowed to access the roofs of tank vehicles without 3 points of contact and a fall prevention system. After the spill, Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc. project management and the management team of the shipper consulted.

THE MATERIAL IN THIS VANS WAS LOADED AND PICKED UP AT PETROLEUM 07/10/2019 ON MANIFEST #013080212FLE (SHIPPER 357528).  BASED ON THE SITUATION WE CONTACTED A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ASSIST WITH THE RESPONSE. THE ER TEAM MOBILIZED TO THE SITE WITH A ROSS PROJECT MANAGER, CREW, SERVICE VEHICLES, SPILL TRAILER, TOW MOTOR WITH TRAILER, PPE AND SUPPLIES. THEY ARRIVED AT THE SITE, SETUP A CONTAINMENT AREA TO PLACE THE CONTAINERS ON AND THEN PROCEEDED TO OPEN THE VAN DOORS AND REMOVE AND INSPECT EACH CONTAINER FROM THE VAN. ABOUT TWO ROWS BACK IN THE VAN THEY CAME ACROSS A GAYLORD BOX THAT WAS LEAKING. THEY PROCEEDED TO UNLOAD ABOUT HALF THE VAN TO VERIFY IF ANY OTHER CONTAINERS WERE LEAKING. FIVE CONTAINERS IN ALL WERE FOUND TO BE LEAKING. THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE GAYLORDS WERE WET FROM THE LEAKS AND WERE NOT IN DOT SHIPPABLE CONDITION.  THE ID #'S ON THE CONTAINERS WERE G0586-004, G0281-325, G0281-318, G0586-054 AND G0586-55 AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LINE 3 OF MANIFEST 013080212FLE BASED ON THE LABEL INFORMATION.

THEY ALSO HAD SEVERAL CONTAINERS IN THE GAYLORDS THAT WERE BROKEN OPEN. THESE THREE CONTAINERS WERE REPACKED INTO NEW GAYLORDS EXCEPT FOR THE FREE LIQUID OR OPEN CONTAINERS. THE LIQUID AND OPEN CONTAINERS WERE PLACED INTO TWO 55-GALLON STEEL DRUMS. THESE GAYLORDS WERE CONTAMINATED ON THE EXTERIOR FROM THE LEAKS AND THEY WERE FOLDED INTO A SUPER SACK WHICH REQUIRED THE CREATION OF A THIRD CONTAINER.

A vehicle pulled out in front of him causing hard braking on the part of our driver. Victor pulled over to the construction are of the Sam Houston Tollway to check his load. Upon walking to the rear of the trailer, he noticed liquid coming out. He promptly called his supervisor Matt Boyette. Matt Boyette notified our internal US Ecology Response Team.  A Harris County Constable stopped and notified Houston Fire Department. Houston Fire Department contacted Masters ARS for cleanup. The leaking trailer was diked with a boom and oil dry. Houston Fire Department made entry into the trailer and found one 55 gallon poly closed top drum had been punctured and was leaking. The split was was in the middle of the drum side and had lost approximately 35 gallons. The damaged drum was over packed, the spill in the trailer was neutralized with Stardust. Spill on the roadway was neutralized and washed off by the fire department.",Our investigation concluded that the force of the braking event caused the drum to slide slightly forward and the metal tensioner on a load-lock punctured the drum.

During the course of the trip, the driver was pulled into the Cajon scale house for a routine  inspection.  A thorough inspection inside the trailer was conducted by CHP. It was determined that a leak was coming from a 55 gallon drum labeled as UN1791 with a hazardous waste label as  sodium hypochlorite.  Clean Harbors response team arrived on site, overpacked the leaking drum and cleaned up the spill material.  Local fire department assisted in providing technical reference  along with overseeing the cleanup.  No further spills were discovered inside the trailer.   It was determined that once the spill was cleaned up, the driver may continue the load to the  intended destination. Additional report made to Office of Emergency Services with report number 19-4543.","After careful inspection of the drum prior to overpacking, a small rust area was noted and is believed to be the area from which the release occurred.   At the time the container was accepted for  transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed.  Our drivers will continue to inspect each container during loading operation if present.  Furthermore warehouse personnel will continue to diligently inspect containers as they come in for continued transportation.

When the truck flipped onto its side, gasoline leaked from the tanker and ran down both sides of Sisson Road.  The Harwich Fire and Police Departments responded swiftly and, working with the Harwich DPW, secured/evacuated the area and worked to contain the spilled gasoline.  Prior to their arrival, gasoline flowed into and through the storm drain system, located under Sisson Road, in a southerly direction, past Route 28, and into a drainage swale south of Route 28.  Gasoline pooled in the drainage swale.  Approximately 8,500 gallons of gasoline was recovered from the overturned tanker.  The volume of gasoline released to the environment is estimated at 3,825 gallons.

ONCE THE STATE PATROL RELEASED OUR EQUIPMENT, WE TOOK IT TO OUR YARD IN COLORADO SPRINGS. A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THE TRAILER WAS TRANSPORTED TO POLAR SERVICE CENTERS FOR REPAIR AND RETESTING. POLAR DISCOVERED ABOUT A DIME SIZED HOLE ON THE BACK OF THE TANKER NEAR THE LADDER. THE TRAILER WAS REPAIRED AND PASSED THE RETEST. THE FIRST VIK INSPECTION AND THE REPAIR ORDER ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS REPORT.  WE DO NOT THINK OUR DRIVER WAS AT FAULT. HE THOROUGHLY INSPECTED HIS TRAILER BEFORE HE LEFT THIS DAY AS WELL AS AFTER HE GOT LOADED. THE TRAILER DEVELOPED A CRACK WHILE IN TRANSIT. THE TRAILER HAD JUST GONE THROUGH ITS VIK/CARGO TANK INSPECTION AND CERTIFICATION BY AN R STAMP CERTIFIED SHOP ON MAY 2, 2019 AND PASSED.

The loading facility does a check for gases in the air while they are loading, and it appeared on camera that the hose moved before it burst which showed that it was under pressure.  There is condensate in the hoses from the heat, and the gases build pressure inside the hose causing it to burst.  The Driver uses the facility's vapor and loading hoses.  Their Safety Dept. came out and looked at the camera footage and determined that their hose was weak and burst. There are no drains nearby.  The facility cleaned up the spill and placed rocks on top.  Driver is on standby as gases are still coming up out of the ground.","No retraining necessary, this was equipment failure.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,GROENDYKE TRANSPORT INC.,US,

The driver immediately closed the internal/external valves, placed his bucket under the relief valve (which was being utilized) and notified the store, Planning Center and Safety. Loves provided boom socks for containment and the Planning Center instructed the driver to contact his TM & Safety. Field Safety Coordinator confirmed the spill was contained and there was no product flowing to any Storm Water Drainage (the spill was contained underneath the GTI trailer) in an area approx. 20' X 10'.  Loves Travel Center notified their response team who responded and provided cleanup. While FSC was talking to the driver, the Loves Mechanic came over and said that the same thing happened to one of the Loves Refine trucks the week before (except the spill was bigger). FSC instructed the driver to not attempt any further unloading and to not leave until the vapor line pressure is reduced and the vapor line is emptied. FSC contacted the KSCY SM who provided assistance to the driver, via phone, on how to relieve the pressure and empty the vapor line. The Loves Response Team assisted with emptying the vapor line into the E. tank. The driver stated that he got a veeder reading prior to unloading, but did not stick the tanks because the sticks will not reach the bottom. Due to Loves having this same problem the week before, FSC felt this spill may be due to an issue with the Loves tanks, and instructed the driver to take the loaded truck back to the KSCY Term, leave the Tractor under the Trailer and lock both units OOS.",This was caused by a defective tank at the store.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,GROENDYKE TRANSPORT INC.,US,
