Driver looked in his left mirror and saw the ""hot pot"", molten container, falling off the trailer. Driver attempted to turn the truck, and apply brakes to upright the container. This did not work. The container of molten aluminum , along with the tractor and trailer overturned causing spillage of molten aluminum. The POP was believed to be one of the binders that secured the ""hot pot"" to the trailer breaking free from the trailer. The lid to the hot pot then broke free allowing the molten aluminum to spill on to the roadway and into the grass.  The spill was contained and cleaned up within 4 hours. The roadway required repairs that were completed the following day.     The trailer has been modified for a different type binder, as well as having the lids of the hot pots engineered in a different manner.",The drivers that transport these types of loads have been retrained on speed while coming into curves.

The driver stated that the leak was a steady drip coming from under the jacket of the insulation approximately 6 feet from the belly valve and running backwards.  The driver placed a bucket underneath the drip which collected approximately 2 cups of material.  No soils, drains or waterways were impacted.  It is unknown how the leak in the trailer formed as there was no apparent damaged to the body of the trailer.  An environmental contractor was dispatched to supervise a Liquid Transport crew transfer the product into a new relief tanker.  The trailers were properly grounded and bonded along with transfer pumps equipment.

There was one piece of hazmat which was an outboard boat motor. They said they are returning to Bethel to investigate the issue. Upon landing we confirmed that the 2 stroke fuel/oil mix was leaked into the plane and there was a small puddle. After removing the motor and cleaning the fuel residue, it was determined by the crew and AC mechanics that some fuel had leaked into the lower floor boards because the fumes were still present. The proper paperwork had been filled out and there were no odors coming from the unit at the time it was received. According to the crew, There was also no odors or leaks discovered before departure, either. The change in pressure and or flight attitude probably caused the remaining fuel inside to evacuate the motor.    Report sent to company safety department and all internal combustion engine transportation was halted pending a complete investigation and a safety risk assessment completed.","Revision to cargo acceptance training emphasizing fuel lines completely drained, sufficiently cleaned of residue and purged of vapors.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Corvus Airlines DBA Ravn Alaska,US,

The CSXT yardmaster received a voicemail message on the yard office line from the shipper, Ascend Performance Materials, that this car was mistakenly offered for transportation and released from their plant.  Ascend advised via a voicemail message to CSXT which was received at 1638 hours that the listed tank car had a leaking valve and was offered by mistake of Ascend to CSXT and that the waybill reflected a residue but the car was a load.  CSXT Hazmat Manager Trent Page responded to the yard and attempted contact back with Ascend with the return number left on the voicemail multiple times with no response back.  H/M Trent Page inspected the car and found a valve failure between the top and bottom flange assembly on the liquid line valve.  Product had escaped at this connection and had already solidified upon inspection with no leaks observed.  H/M Trent Page contacted the shipper, Ascend Performance Materials (Ed Waldynski 850-712-5036) via Chemtrec.  Ed, shipper Ascend Performance Materials, was updated and requested to confirm load status, update waybill, confirm known issues with the car, and dispatch a certified mobile repair company for valve repairs.  Ed confirmed that the car had a known valve failure at the plant and was mistakenly offered for transportation.    Ascend Performance Materials, shipper, updated the waybill to reflect a loaded car and dispatched ResCar who replaced a bad gasket on the liquid line flange connection.  Hepaco, CSX Emergency Response Contractor, responded and cleaned the housing and valve of released product.  The car will remain on hold status until an OTMA-1 is applied for by the shipper, Ascend, to move back to their facility for a pressure test.      Due to lack of evidence it was unable to be determined if any release occurred during transportation or prior to transportation.

Responding BNSF field officers and hazmat responder found a liquid leak coming from the liquid valve and evaporating upon contact with the ground.  The cause of the leak was primarily caused by failure of shipper to apply secondary closure cap on the liquid outlet.  Cap was found in the cabinet lying adjacent to the outlet.  The securement device holding the wheel valve for the liquid line in place for transportation became disengaged in transport due to a spoke on the wheel valve where it was connected had broken.  This allowed the valve to vibrate open, and lack of secondary closure cap allowed liquid to leak into the environment.  Outlet cap was applied by BNSF personnel, valve handle closed, and securement device re-attached.  No environmental cleanup required, car was allowed to proceed to local destination for offloading.",Shipper must audit for compliance with DOT hazmat transportation rules and bring deficiencies into compliance during pre-trip inspection process.

The trailer dripped 93% sulfuric acid out of the yard and some onto the city street 27th ave at the light where the load was waiting for the light to change. Less than half a gallon was released from the trailer. The drips in the yard were neutralized and the spot on the city street was mostly dry and absorbed by the asphalt. After further investigation the manway gasket was not seated completely on the dome lid causing liquid to seep out into the crow’s nest to the drain pipes and then to the ground. The loader said he did close and tighten the dome lid but did not notice the unseated gasket.  The driver said he did check the wing nut before he left the yard and that they we tight.

A car traveling toward him was drifting across the center line.  Upon seeing this, the driver moved the tractor trailer as far onto the berm as possible to avoid collision.  The other vehicle continued into the oncoming traffic lane and collided with the semi and tanker.  This forced the truck into the ditch and up an embankment, then to roll back onto the drivers side.  The driver immediately contacted the owner at the home office which is just approximately 10 miles up the road.  A second truck and trailer were dispatched to the scene.  Jae's Towing, of Newark, Ohio was called in to upright and tow the vehicles.  Due to the heat, fuel in compartment 1 and 5 started to mist at the manhole covers.  Diapers were placed under the tanker to catch any spray.  When the truck was overturned, owner, Todd Dugan ground the tankers and immediately started transferring the product to the second tanker, thus alleviating the risk of loss.  The clean up was minimal, the diapers were removed by TD Petroleum, and there was no kill from the small leak.  Although the report was 100 gallon loss, we do not feel that this is accurate, it would have required much more clean up if that were true.  Ohio EPA On Scene Coordinator, Trevor Irwin was on site, and inspected the site after clean up, and was satisfied.","Our drivers receive monthly safety training, along with annual training.  As the accident was not the fault of our driver, and he did everything he could to avoid it, there doesn't seem to be a course of action to prevent further incidents.

LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS OF PINELAND/JASPR AND CALABRIAN PERSONNEL WERE CONTACTED TO ESTABLISH AND IMPLEMENT THE APPROPRIATE ACTION NECESSARY TO PREVENT ANY HARM TO THE PUBLIC. THE RESPONDERS MADE THE PRECAUTIONARY DECISION TO EVACUATE LOCALS AROUND A 2 MILE RADIUS AND RESTRICT TRAFFIC FLOW WHILE TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE SOURCE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE LEAK. CALABRIAN’S REPRESENTATIVES ARRIVED ON THE SCENE APPROXIMATELY 11:00 PM AND WERE NOT ALLOWED TO APPROACH THE TRAILER UNTIL 01:30 AM. IT WAS EVENTUALLY AGREED THAT THE GAS LEAK WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO AUTHORIZE RELEASE OF TRAILER TO RETURN TO CALABRIAN’S, PORT NECHES FACILITY AT APPROXIMATELY 03:30 AM.     THE TRAILER WAS RECEIVED BACK AT THE CALABRIAN PLANT SITE AT 04:38 AM AND THE SULFUR DIOXIDE LIQUID WAS THE SAME AS THE ORIGINALLY SHIPPED LEVEL. THIS CONFIRMS THAT NO APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT WAS RELEASED TO THE ENVIRONMENT. INSPECTION DISCLOSED A HAIRLINE CRACK ON THE WELD OF A THREADED FITTING CONNECTED TO THE INTERNAL VAPOR VALVE. IT WAS ALSO ESTABLISHED THAT THE INTERNAL VAPOR VALVE WAS NOT SEATING PROPERLY. THE LEAK WAS INTERMITTENT VAPOR FROM THE VAPOR SPACE THROUGH THE CRACK AS A RESULT OF DEFECTIVE INTERNAL VAPOR VALVE WHICH ESSENTIALLY EXPLAINS THE UNCHANGED LIQUID LEVEL.    DOCUMENTED DOT INSPECTIONS CONDUCTED ON SUBJECT TRAILER # 6 BY POLAR ON 04/15/2014 AND 04/02/2015 DID NOT DETECT ANY LEAKS OR VALVE FAILURES.
