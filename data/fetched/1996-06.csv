DURING THE LOAD CHECK, THE DRIVER DISCOVERED A SMALL AMOUNT OF MATERIAL DRIPPING FROM THE BACK OF THE VAN TRAILER.

AT THIS TIME, CLEAN HARBOR'S CORPORATE COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT WAS NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT AND INITIATED CALLS TO THE APPLICABLE STATE AGENCIES IN MINNESOTA.  WHILE THE STATE WAS BEING NOTIFIED, THE DRIVER'S DISPATCHER CONTACTED A LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPANY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN RESPONDING TO THE RELEASE.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SCENE, THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CREW IDENTIFIED THAT 1 X 55 GALLON DRUM HAD DEVELOPED A SMALL PINHOLE LEAK ON THE TOP OF THE DRUM WHICH ALLOWED APPROXIMATELY 8 OUNCES OF MATERIAL TO ESCAPE FROM THE DRUM ONTO THE FLOOR OF THE VAN TRAILER.  A SMALL PORTION OF THIS MATERIAL ESCAPED FROM THE TRUCK ONTO THE ASPHALT PARKING AREA OF THE TRUCK STOP. THE RESPONSE CREW ENTERED THE TRAILER AND PLACED THE DAMAGED CONTAINER INTO A SUITABLE SALVAGE DRUM.  IN ADDITION, 1 X 5 GALLON CONTAINER OF CONTAMINATED SPEEDI DRY WAS GENERATED IN CONJUNCTION WITH REMOVAL OF SPEEDI DRY FROM THE ASPHALT PARKING AREA AS WELL AS FROM THE FLOOR OF THE VAN TRAILER.

PRIOR TO PLACEMENT WITHIN THE BOX, EACH CAPACITOR WAS MARKED WITH A HAZARDOUS WASTE ""LABLE"", A PCB MARK, AN RQ MARK, AND A CLASS 9 LABEL.  THE OUTSIDE OF EACH CRATE WAS MARKED AND LABELED IN A SIMILAR MANNER.  EACH BOX WAS LOADED ONTO THE BACK OF A FLAT BED TRAILER WITHIN A CONTAINMENT PAN WHICH RAN THE LENGTH OF THE TRUCK AND BRACED WITH A NYLON STRAP TO PREVENT MOVEMENT. FIVE OTHER STEEL 55 GALLON CAPACITY DRUMS WERE LOADED AT THE SAME PICK-UP LOCATION (BOISE, ID), THESE ITEMS BEING PLACED AT THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER AND BLOCKED TO PREVENT MOVEMENT.  THE MATERIAL WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE ERICKSON, INC YARD IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH AND THEN TRANSPORTED TO THE ROLLINS FACILITY AT ARAGONITE, UT.  AT NO TIME DURING INSPECTIONS IN TRANSIT OR IN THE ERICKSON YARD WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE OF A SPILL OR LEAK. FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER ARRIVING AT THE DISPOSAL FACILITY, THE SPILL WAS DISCOVERED.  UPON DISCOVERY, THE MATERIAL WAS UNLOADED AND PROCESSED (I.E., INCINERATED) AND THE SPILL CLEANED UP, THIS MATERIAL ALSO BEING INCINERATED.  IT IS BELIVED BY ERICKSON THAT DUE TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE BOXES ON THE END OF THE TRAILER, WHICH WAS BASICALLY EMPTY, THE BOXES WERE SUBJECTED TO EXCESSIVE FORCE WHICH CAUSED THE BLOCKING AND BRACING WITHIN THE WOODEN BOX CONTAINING 5 CAPACITORS TO LOOSEN.  DURING THE MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE ERICKSON YARD AND THE ROLLINS FACILITY SIMILAR FORCES CAUSED THE BLOCKING AND BRACING TO FAIL.  UPON STOPPING AT THE FACILITY, ONE OR MORE OF THE CAPACITORS DISLODGED STRIKING THE BOX, SEVERING THE INSULATOR FROM THE CAPACITOR CAUSING THE CAPACITOR TO DISCHARGE ITS CONTENTS.  THE CONTAINMENT PAN SEAL FAILED (POSSIBLY DUE TO SHIFTING OF THE BOXES DUE TO THE SAME FORCES WHICH CAUSED THE BRACING IN THE BOXES TO FAIL.  ERICKSON HAS INSTRUCTED ITS DRIVERS TO PLACE LADINGS AS CLOSE TO THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER AS POSSIBLE.  THIS SHOULD MINIMIZED THE FORCES TO WHICH THE LADINGS ARE SUBJECTED.

JEFFREY HAM WAS DISPATCHED TO TRANSPORT THE LOAD FROM THE GASTON SC.  TERMINAL TO DELIVER THE LOAD TO PROCHEM CHEMICAL INC.  LOCATED AT 510 W GRIMES ROAD IN HIGH POINT NC.  ENROUTE TO CONSIGNEE (DESTINATION) MR. HAM WAS TRAVELING ON INTERSTATE 77 AT APPROXIMATELY 0815 ON THE OUT SKIRTS OF CHARLOTTE WHEN AN UNKNOWN VEHICLE SUDDENLY CHANGES LANES INFRONT OF HIM AND THEN HIT THE  BRAKES COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP.  MR. HAM DEFENSIVELY APPLIED HIS BRAKES TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT, MAINTAINED CONTROL AND SLOWED THE VEHICLE TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT, MAINTAINED CONTROL AND SLOWED THE VEHICLE TO AVOID STRIKING THE VEHICLE INFROMT OF HIM.  THE WHEELS NEVER LOCKED OR SKIDDED DURING THE APPLICATION OF THE BRAKES.  THE TRAFFIC CONTINUED NORTH BOUND AND MR. HAM PROCEEDED ON TO TO HIS DESTINATION.  AT THIS TIMER MR. HAM WAS NOT AWARE OF THE PROBLEM THAT EXISTED INSIDE THE TRAILER.  WHILE ON INTERSTATE 77 JUST BEFORE THE INTERSECTION OF I-77 AND I-85 A MOTORIST MOTIONED THAT HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE UNIT.  BEING LESS THAN (2) MILES FROM THE CHARLOTTE TERMINAL, MR. HAM PROCEEDED TO THE TERMINAL YARD TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM.  ONCE HE ARRIVED AT THE CHARLOTTE YARD, HE REALIZED THAT THE PROBLEM EXISTED WITHIN THE TRAILER.  THE ODOR OF THE CHEMICAL WAS THE INITIAL INDICATION AND ONCE THE VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP HE NOTICED THE PRODUCT LEAKING OUT OF THE TRAILER.  THE TRAILER WAS THE MOVED TO A REMOTE AEA SO THAT IT COULD NE DEALT WITH ACCORDING TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE GUIDE BOOK. AT APPROXIMATELY 1030 AM I (MIKE HARLAN) WAS NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.  MY LOCATION AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WAS NORFOLK VA. AND AT THAT TIME CALLED CHARLOTTE TERMINAL AND TALKED TO THE DRIVER MANAGER (STEVE DILLINGER).  WE CONTACTED MR BILL BENNETT WITH SOUTHEASTERN FREIGHT LINBES WHO IS THE SAFETY DIRECTOR FOR THAT TERMINAL MR. BENNETT THEN PROCEEDED TO LOCATE THE NATURE OF THE SPILL AND BEGIN CLEAN UP.  A MSDS WAS OBTAINED FROM ALBRIGHT AND WILSON TO HELP IN THE INVESTIGATION. THE DAMAGED PRODUCT WAS PLACED IN AN OVERPACKED DRUM AND THE PRODUCT THAT WAS LEAKING FROM THE TRAILER WAS CONTAINED IN ANOTHER 55 GALLON DRUM. THE PRODUCT WAS PLACED IN AN OVERPACKED DRUM AND THE PRODUCT THAT WAS LEAKING FROM THE TRAILER WAS CONTAINED IN ANOTHER 55 GALLON DRUM.  THE PRODUCT ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER WAS ABSORBED WITH QUIK DRY AND LATER PLACED INTO ANOTHER DRUM. THAT NIGHT (6-4-96) THE OTHER 79 DRUMS WERE OFF LOADED AND PLACED ONTO ANOTHER TRAILER FOR DELIVERY THE NEXT DAY.  ONLY ONE DAMAGED PLASTIC DRUM WAS INVOLVED IN THE SPILL.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE SPILL WAS DUE TO LOADING PROCEDURES AND THE LOAD NOT BE SECURED TO PREVENT THE CARGO FROM SHIFTING.  THE SHIPPER HAD PLACED (60 PALLETS IN THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER, (3) ON EACH SIDE TO MOVED THE CARGO BACK TO ELIMINATE THE TRAILER FROM BEING TOO HEAVY IN THE NOSE.

UPON INVESTIGATING BY A/C MAINTENANCE AND OUR ESE/ESC WORK FORCE WE FOUND THAT THE SMOKE ODOR WAS COMING FROM A LARGE PIECE OF LUGGAGE... I TOOK THE BAG TO THE CENTER CHECKPOINT WHERE I X-RAYED THE BAG..WE FOUND A SPOT THAT NEEDED CHECKING AND I OPENED THE BAG AND FOUND A 10CAP BLASTING MACHINE CAPACITY SERIAL NO.S10-90BJ.
