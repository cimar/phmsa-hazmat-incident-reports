While in storage, a routine inspection identified a small amount of material dripping from the van trailer.  Facility personnel utilizing appropriate personnel protective equipment entered the trailer and identified a 55 gallon non bulk package that had developed a small pinhole leak in the bottom of the container.  It is unclear if the container was punctured by a foreign object or if external corrosion identified on the bottom of the container resulted in the release.  The crew secured the container by placing it into a suitable salvage drum along with all material used to clean-up the area impacted by the release.  This included a small amount of gravel that was impacted by the material as well as absorbents and clean-up debris generated during the response activities.  Once secured, the van was sent to the intended waste management facility where the shipment was received and processed for disposal.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking was observed.  The driver, however, was advised that it is his responsibility to conduct a thorough inspection of each container accepted for transportation and to take appropriate actions in the event a container with suspect structural integrity was indentified.  It was pointed out to the driver and the shipper that excessive corrosion is an indication that a specific container could present a risk during the rigors of transportation.  The driver was further cautioned that a repeat occurrence could result in disciplinary actions.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

GATU 137396 was carefully moved to the intermodal facility's containment area. A hazardous material/environmental response contractor was called to inspect GATU 137396 and remediate spillage. The responders reported that the doorway inspection of GATU 137396 revealed 55 gallon steel drums loaded in two tiers. One bottom tier drum (UN 1A1/X1.8/300/09/USA/GBC7) at the doorway had leaked from its bottom chime area from abrasion during transit when it came in contact with the raised steel plating at the doorway threshold. This drum was removed from the container and placed into an overpack drum and properly returned to the shipment origin.

The container had other class 8 cargo and was placarded class 8.  A comparison of the original billing with the corrected billing indicated that the shipper incorrectly declared 96 cartons of NA17604 totaling 4483 pounds.  The piece count and weight were correct but the description should have been for UN1903 rather than NA1760.

After this was done in XLA it was put on a pallet and turn in to the other three drums sitting on the same pallet, and wrap with shrink wrap. Left there to leak out on the trip to UBY.","To help prevent a recurrence of this happening again, is we need to be totally aware of are surroundings and make Sure we are using the proper handling methods, and if for some reason we do have a incident like this we could have flipped this drum over and put it into a recovery drum and stopped all of the leakage from happening, And far as the receiving service center side we need to make sure we are following all of the company's protocol as well as all of the company's policy.

When he got to the front of the trailer 5 gallon cans of paint thinner were partially off their pallet with one can completely off the pallet and laying on its side on the floor. The pallets consisted of a single layer of cans of thinner and ctns of paint related products. The said pallet was loosely wrapped with clear wrap and a black top, He picked the can up, noticed that the can was dented but did not see it leaking at that time so he sit it on top on the pallet. The pallet was staged on the dock until it could be loaded. When another driver sales rep went to load the pallet he noticed the wrap on the top of the pallet was wet were the can was sitting. Upon further investigation it was discovered that there was a small pin hole where the dent was and that some of the material was seeping through the hole. Product was not properly wrapped by shipper nor was the shipment secured in the trailer to ensure that product did not slide around. Pallets toward the nose were small pallets so there was space in between the pallets allowing product to shift in transit.",Contact shipper to suggest tighter wrapping of product onto pallet.

As a result, the tractor-tanker rolled over and caught fire while traveling the subject lease road.  The accident caused an breach to the tanker unit in tow.  The subject tanker unit was loaded with 192 barrels of crude oil.  An estimated 5-12 barrels of crude oil were released to the soil surrounding the accident site.  The fire that ensued following the accident consumed the remainder of the cargo load.    At approximately 3:50 p.m. CST, Ms. Celeste Kaban of TPG Transport, LLC, contacted Cura Emergency Services and requested the dispatch of a response crew from Eco-Logical Environmental Services (Eco-Logical), located in Midland, Texas, to assess the site and initiate corrective actions.    The crew from Eco-Logical arrived on site and met with Mr. Ernie Kariainen of TPG Transport, LLC.  On site personnel determined that the release had traveled down the hillside where the accident had occurred, causing the crude oil to pool within a gully.  Personnel from Eco-Logical determined that recovery of the free liquid from the gully was not feasible with the vacuum truck due to the consistency. The crew scheduled additional work for the following day and demobilized from the site.    On March 8, 2010, the crew from Eco-Logical returned to the site and met with Mr. Kariainen.  Crewmembers determined that excavation over the affected roadway (a length of approximately 1/4 mile) was not cost effective.  The lease locations did not want to close the road and an excavation would require the use of a ripper as the road was very hard packed rock.  Mr. Kariainen requested that crewmembers from Eco-Logical pressure wash the affected area on the roadway, down gradient, and recover the rinsate within the gully at the base of the hill.  Crewmembers from Eco-Logical constructed soil dikes along the roadway as containment measures.  The crew began pressure washing the affected areas.    From March 9, 2010 - March 11, 2010, crewmembers from Eco-Logical pressure washed the affected areas on the roadway of the lease site.  The release covered a distance of approxiamtely 1/4 mile, was 6 feet wide at the largest point and, 6 inches deep at the most heavily saturated areas.  The rinsate was recovered with vacuum trucks and sent to Wilson Disposal and Hank's Saltwater for final disposal.  Excavation over the affected area is currently underway.  Personnel from Talon Environmental have been retained to conduct the remainder of excavation/treatment operations for the subject site.",,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,122100,"TPG Transport, LLC",US,

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder was called and immediately inspected UTLX 202122. The responder reported that the liquid valve was leaking product via its closure plug. Internal pressure within UTLX 202122 was reduced and the responder removed the closure plug for further inspection. The liquid valve was in the closed position, but product appeared to be by-passing this valve's closure or valve seat. Teflon tape was applied to the plug's threads, reinserted and tool tightened. No further product release was evident after the plug was reinstalled. All spillage evaporated. UTLX 202122 was monitored by BNSF responders while awaiting further instructions from the shipper. FRA Movement Approval FRA-10030146 was granted to return UTLX 202122 to its origin for unloading and then forwarding to a qualified repair facility for liquid valve repair or replacement.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at an in transit storage location for the purpose of consolidating less than truckload quantities for continued transportation.  Upon arrival at the in transit storage area, facility personnel initiate the process of transferring the container to an alternative van trailer.  It was at this point that the individual moving the container identified a small amount of material leaking from a seam on the container.  Facility personnel secured the vehicle and initiated the transfer of the material from the initial container into an alternative container.  This operation was completed without incident.  In addition, the minimal amount of material that was released was clean-ed up and all debris was placed into the container that was found to be leaking.  This container, along with the replacement container was placed onto the containing transporter’s van trailer and was sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility.","At the time the driver arrived at the shipper's location, the container was inspected and no evidence of leaking or damage was observed.

Subsequently, the tractor overturned damaging both the tractor and trailer. As a result, the tractor released approximately 100 gallons of diesel fuel onto the asphalt shoulder. The fuel traveled down gradient and into a storm drain and nearby outfall with standing storm water. The impact also damaged an undetermined amount of containers, resulting in the release of approximately 2,240 gallons of a liquid organophosphorus compound (Class 6.1, UN2810).",The crew from Moran arrived on site and met with representatives from the PRFD and SC DHEC to discuss the cleanup operations. The tractor-trailer was uprighted and Moran personnel donned level B PPE and entered the trailer. The product was pumped from the damaged containers. The damaged containers were then removed from the trailer and staged for disposal The remaining product was then transferred from the damaged trailer and shipped to its original destination. Moran personnel applied granular absorbents to the freestanding product. The absorbents were worked in with hand tools and collected for disposal. Moran personnel then utilized a vacuum truck to collect the free product from the catch basn and outfall area. Cleanup operations continued until no visual or olfactory indicators of product could be obsevred. The area was secured and the crew de-moblized. Moran personnel re-mobilized to the site at a later date to excavate the affected areas of soil.,Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,ZZ,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,47000,Cura Emergency Services,US,

This is a jacketed tank car and access to the tank shell in order to fully assess the source of the release was not possible.  The car was noted dripping on the Weyerhaeuser Lead track while being switched into the destination plant facility.  The decision was made with concurrence of local emergency responders to contain the drip and move the car the short distance into the plant where the car was destined for immediate unloading.

Bob truck AH1130 was on our yard after returning from a delivery at 11:30am. At 11:55am I was loading an aqua tanker when I heard a loud “pop” and hissing, I looked up and immediately saw an ammonia vapor cloud approximately 15 feet high. I ran around to the water cannon turned it on the leak and began knocking down the remaining visible vapor, within 30-45 seconds of the hose failure the visible vapor had subsided and only residual vapor pressure was being emitted. I kept the water cannon on the hose and called Butch Johnson at 11:58am, followed by the Fire Department at 12:00pm and NRC at 12:05pm. The Columbus fire Department arrived at 12:07pm surveyed the situation and left at approximately 12;30pm.  The hose was protected by a hydrostat which did not release  I am shipping the hose and the hydro to Concord to try and determine if the hose or the hydro is at fault for the failure.

The vehicle was escorted by the officer to Exit 49 Tandem Terminal on the NY state thruway in order to indeitfy, container and remediate the situation.  A company representative met the driver and inspected the cargo.  The load appeared to be dry and it was Clean Harbor's position that the leaking material was residual rain water that had collected in the rail of the roll-off frame. The condition of the roll-off can did indicate some minor defects and visually, it did appear that the liquid was leaking from the cargo compartment even though no visible liquid was observed in the roll-off. The driver inspected the closure device and re-secured the load to the satisfaction of the COnservation Officer.  The driver was released and proceeded to the intended waste management facility.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking or damage was observed. Upon inspection at the Tandem Terminal it was determined the can was leaking from the frame; no water was present in the roll-off which was lined properly. Rain water in the frame was suspected as being the substance leaking.  The driver has been re instructed to insure that during rain events that the vehicle is adequaltely tarped and any residual precipitation is removed to insure that rain water does not eneter the cargo compartment resulting in a release or threat of release.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

During the course of the trip, the driver conducted a routine load inspection and discovered a small amount of material had escaped from on of the intermediate bulk packages being transported.  It appeared that the weight of a container loaded on top of damaged container caused the package to split open allowing a small amount of material to escape onto the trailer floor.  The driver immediately contacted his hoe dispatcher and a response crew was dispatched to the scene.  Upon arrival, the response crew stabilized the damaged container and placed in an alternative vehicle for transport to a safe location where the container could be repackaged for continued transportation.  This activity was completed without further incident.  In addition, the released material was re containerized and all debris generated from the response activities was collected and placed into the original container for disposal.  Once repacked, the shipment, along with all clean-up debris was sent for disposal at the intended facility.","In order to prevent a recurrence, loading personnel and the driver were advised of the suspected cause of the release.

THE TRAILER WAS LOADED BY THE PLANT PERSONNEL AND THE DRIVER WAS PROVIDED PLACARDS AND SHIPPING PAPERS REQUIRED FOR TRANSPORT.  THE DRIVER CHECKED THAT ALL OPENINGS WERE SECURE BEFORE DRIVING ON THE PUBLIC ROADWAY.  SHORTLY AFTER LEAVING THE PLANT THE DRIVER OBSERVED PRODUCT LEAKING FROM THE TANK.  THE DRIVER WAS IN 800 BLOCK OF STATE STREET IN LOCKPORT, IL.  THE DRIVER STOPPED THE TRUCK TO CHECK FOR THE PROBLEM.  AT THAT POINT THE TRUCK DID NOT MOVE AGAIN UNTIL THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED.  THE FAILURE WAS LISTED AS A GASKET WHICH IS PARTIALLY CORRECT.  THE PROBLEM WAS NOT THAT THE DOME GASKET FAILED WHICH IT DIDN'T BUT RATHER THE DOME GASKET WAS NOT IN PLACE.  THE DOME WAS SECURED BUT THE SEAL WAS NOT MADE.  THE LOADER AT THE SHIPPING FACILITY SECURED THE DOME AND SEALED THE DOME LID AFTER LOADING.  THE DRIVER CHECKED AND IT APPEARED THAT THE DOME WAS TIGHT AND EVERYTHING WAS PROPERLY SECURED.  THE FACT IS AT SOME POINT THE DOME GASKET WAS REMOVED FROM THE DOME COLLAR AND PLACE OFF TO THE SIDE ON THE TOP OF THE TANK.  HOW THIS HAPPENDED CAN ONLY BE EXPLAINED AS HUMAN ERROR.  BUT BECAUSE OF THIS THE PRODUCT LEAKED FROM THE TOP OF THE TANK. AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AND HENIFF MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON THE SCENE THEY IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  THEY PUT THE DOME GASKET BACK IN PLACE AND THEN TIGHTEN THE DOME LID SECUREDLY.  THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  THE XYLENE THAT HAD LEAKED WAS ON THE ASPHALT ROADWAY.  THE LOCKPORT FIRE DEPARTMENT PUT DOWN 6 BAGS OF OIL DRY TO ABSORB THE MATERIAL FROM THE ASPHALT.  HAZCHEM ENVIRONMENTAL CORP DISPATCHED TWO PERSONS TO THE SCENE AT THE REQUEST OF HENIFF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS TO PICK UP THE CONTAMINATED OIL DRY.

The driver hit the emergency shut off switch but approximately 320 gallons spilled into the containment area. No fuel reached soil or drains. The BP environmental representative was on site and approved the clean up.",It was determined that the probe in compartment 5 was not working properly and will repaired prior to future use.

Andrew stopped at the parking lot of a Myers Elgin Sausage restaurant to check his load, when he noticed there was Sulfuric Acid leaking though the bottom of his trailer onto the asphalt.  He discovered that one of the drums had been punctured by a raised nail head imbedded in a pallet that it was secured to.  The puncture was at the very bottom of the drum close to the edge.  The puncture size was about as big as standard eraser head on the end of a pencil.  Andrew was able to turn the drum over onto its side to stop the drum from leaking any further. He then took the appropriate measures to contain the spill with pads, socks and absorbent material.  Approximately 5 gallons of material had leaked from the drum onto the asphalt parking lot.  Estimated duration of release - 15 minutes.  He immediately called the office and reported the incident to Brady Hamilton after he was able to contain the spill.  Our emergency response contractor, Environmental Mgt, was then called to initiate a cleanup and dispose of the neutralized material.  The time was approximately 4:00 pm.  In the meantime Brady Hamilton and Chris Thompson rushed to the scene to help secure the area.  Brady and Chris arrived at approximately 5:00pm. TAS Environmental (cleanup contractor of Enviromental Mgt) arrived on the scene at approximately 6pm.  The punctured drum was put into a overpack and everything else was neutralized, wiped down and disposed of by the company.  They completed their work at approximately 8:00 pm that night.",Corrective Action-We have gone to pallet-less drum deliveries to avoid these types of problems in the future.,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2250,"FSTI, INC.",US,

Prior to final shipment to the TSDF, the driver checked his load, noticed an odor and a skewed cubic yard box in the nose of the trailer.  4. ER contractor was called – truck was unloaded – drum/shipment identified.  5. Drum had ruptured under pressure – material was listed as a paint related liquid and was observed to be a polymerized solid without any free liquid that caused a failure on the bottom seam of the drum.  6. Polymerized paint related material appeared to have rapidly left the drum without any release outside of the transport vehicle.  7. Truck and drums were cleaned.  8. Polymerized solids and cleaning liquids were containerized for proper disposal.","We are recommending:  1. A review of the incident with the generator of the waste, our Customer Service personnel, and our drivers with the suggestion of refresher training on compatibility, profiling, communication, and the consequences of mixing incompatible materials.    2.

JOHN VINZANT,ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGER,,,,,Carrier,"The driver was south bound on State Route 8 coming from Titusville heading toward Rouseville in Pennsylvania.  The tractor trailer rolled over and hit a bridge while negotiating a curve on Route 8 approximately 3 miles north of Rouseville.  The impact of the trailer with the bridge caused the tanker to be broken in two pieces.  One half of the trailer was still attached to the tractor which ended up on it's side on the bridge.  The other half ended up in the creek below the bridge.  The result of the crash caused the load of 7442 gallons of ultra low sulfur diesel to be released and catch on fire.  Some of the product that was release spilled into a stream below the bridge that flows into Oil Creek and the Allegheny River.  The fire and release continued for at least 2 hours before it was under control by emergency responders.    Upon notification of the accident we contacted McCutcheon Enterprises to dispatch an emergency responce cleanup team to the scene.  They along with the DEP , EPA and Fire Department contaned the fire and remaining hazardous material to the best of there ability.    In addition to the equipment damage and product loss there was about 300 feet of guard rail damaged as well as damage to the bridge that was struck by the equipment.  The damaged equipment was taken by Minich’s Towing and Klapec Trucking to Minich’s salvage yard located at 1682 Riverside Drive in Oil City, PA.  For information on the equipment contact Chris Minich at 814-676-2156.","After the accident, in an effort to improve safe driving, we implemented training reviews and safety awareness programs for all active drivers.  We also altered starting times of drivers in an effort to allow drivers to be more rested before they begin there day.

Truck and trailer were headed southbound on Rt. 31 in the middle lane at 50-55 mph. Speed limit is 55 mph. Road made a slight jog to the left and shoulder ends. The unit drifted to the right lane and then the right steer and drive tires went off the road and stayed parallel with the pavement for 48 feet.The driver over corrected turning the wheel to the left to avoid a mail box causing the tractor and trailer to rollover onto it's right side. The truck and trailer slid 197 feet coming to rest with the tractor in the center median and the trailer lying across the two left south bound lanes. The weight of the loaded tanker sliding the distance that it did,ground the right side of the tank down near the bulkheads at all four compartments causing several holes ranging in lengths of six to eighteen inches. All four compartments drained out in a very short time flowing south into a drainage sewer and west into a field. An off duty Kenosha County Serriffs Deputy was first on the scene and contacted emergency services. County workers and the Somers Fire Dept. contained the spill with sand and booms. A private environmental contractor was notified by A D Conner and took over containment and clean up. The driver was transported to the hospital where he was checked out and received a post accident drug and alcohol test. He was then questioned by Kenosha County Sheriffs Police and A D Conner safety officials and released. The tractor and trailer were up righted and towed to the company's storage yard where it was inspected by the Wisconsin DOT and then transported back to A D Conner in Frankfort II.","Retrain drivers on the importance of keeping focused on the job at hand.

Shortly after his arrival he attempted to depart the facility with tractor 187 and trailer 119.  Trailer 119 was loaded with Hydrochloric Acid loaded at PPG.  This load was to deliver on BOL 326168-1 to Albemarle in Pasadena, Texas at 6AM.      There has been ongoing constructions on the road in front of the Houston Facility.  Harris County had poured cement on the eastbound side of Haden Road that weekend and the cones were still up at the time of the incident.  All eastbound traffic was to use the temporary road on the south side of Haden Road. The driver was attempting to making a right turn onto the westbound side of Haden Road.  Due to the construction over the weekend, the lane was extremely narrow.  The driver attempted the turn 5 times before backing up on the scale to increase the turning space.  He attempted the turn 2 more times.  On the 7th try, the driver stopped, looked around and thought that he could complete the turn. As he was exiting, his back axles came off the pavement onto the soft 18 inch shoulder.  The ground gave way and the truck and trailer rolled into the ditch. The equipment, both truck and trailer, came to rest on the passenger side in the ditch. The crash box on the trailer was damaged and there was a slow leak coming from the air valve. The CPVC air valve had snapped off the trailer at the flange. The product was fuming. The driver sustained a small bump on his head but was otherwise uninjured.      The driver call dispatch and 911.  Mike Sellers arrived at the facility around 5:45 AM. The fire department was already on scene and the area had been shut down. Both the road and the railroad were shut down until 10:45 AM.  At 10:45 AM one lane of the road was reopened. The road was closed periodically until 10:30 PM on 3/29/10.  Andy Yaksic arrived on scene around 10:45 AM.  Oil Mop was called in to begin the remediation.      At 2:30 PM they started pumping the contents of trailer 119 into trailer 403A with a diaphragm pump, about 3627 gallons. The truck and trailer 119 was up righted around 9:00 PM. About 7 inches or 378 gallons of product was still on 119.     This leaves about 610 gallons of Hydrochloric Acid in the ditch. Sodium Bicarbonate was added to the ditch water in an effort to neutralize the material.  46,780 pounds of water was pumped from the ditch to trailer 117.  The material on 117 has a pH of 1.5. The liquid waste will be shipped out as hazardous waste by PSC.     Sodium Bicarbonate was added to the ground in an effort to neutralize the soil.  Six (6) 20 ton roll off boxes of soil have been filled with pH samples between 5 and 11.  This material will be shipped out as non hazardous waste to PSC.","Root Cause(s) of Incident:  Driver failed to maintain control of his equipment while egressing from the Houston facility.     Contributing Factor(s):  Driver failed to stop trying to exit the facility until someone could assist him.  Weekend construction of Haden Road narrowed Westbound lane.  Poor design of Haden Road – Other facilities on Haden Road have expressed concerns about the design of this road especially while under construction.  PVS was already looking into adding additional concrete to increase the turning radius for trucks entering and exiting the facility.   Construction schedule was not properly communicated to PVS Technologies.  Harris County indicated that the road would be available for use on Monday morning.  There were no signs indicating that a left turn should have been made or a right turn should not have been made.  No signs indicating “DETOUR” or alternate routing.   Spill box was crushed resulting in damage to the air valve  The piping on the truck was polypropylene, had it been Teflon lined carbon steel the leak may  not have occurred.     Corrective Action(s):  The driver was given a citation for failure to maintain lane but was not issued any DOT citations.  Plant Manager to make it mandatory for all trucks leaving the Facility to exit via the scale lane.  County to add 15 feet of concrete to cover the culvert.",Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,114513,PVS Transportation,US,

Mr. Folse stopped at the Cajun Truck Plaza which is located at the corner of AC. Rappelet Road and N.J. Theriot Road in Port Fourchon, LA. Mr. Folse stopped to use the restroom and get a drink before proceeding to his unloading destination, since there was already another truck currently offloading in front of him.   At approximately 10:30 AM, he proceeded to leave the Cajun Truck Plaza through the rear exit, which exits on 1st Street, which is also the road that is the entrance for C-Port # 2. There is a large hole in the pavement directly in front of the exit, which Mr. Folse had to pass through on his way out of the facility. Mr. Folse made the normal large left hand turn, while still in 1st gear to insure that he was able to make the turn under control. He was watching in his mirrors to insure that he was able to make the turn as safe as possible. While making the turn onto the road, 1st Street, all of the eight (8) tires of the rear axles were still on the ground, but the rear driver’s outside tire was approximately four to six inches over the edge, but the majority of the tire was still on the pavement. The edge of the driveway was rounded a one point, with an approximate two and 1/2 foot drop to the bottom of the ditch. When Mr. Folse’s wet tires hit this rounded section of the driveway and with the weight of the trailer, this was too much for the traction of the tires to overcome and the trailer slipped into the ditch. The rear axle of the trailer went into the ditch, which caused the trailer to come to rest on the driver side of the tank trailer. The rear axle of the truck, while remaining connected to the trailer, twisted in the air to the driver’s side of the vehicle. The front tires of the truck remained in contact with the pavement of the road entire time of the incident.","AFTER THE ACCIDENT ON MARCH 1, 2010, ALL OF OUR DRIVERS WERE RE-TRAINED ON THE PROPER ACCIDENT PROTOCOLS SET UP FORTH BY OUR COMPANY.

The release filled the spill containment bucket and flowed over the concrete tank pad until it reached the surrounding asphalt. The gasoline then flowed in a southeasterly direction and entered a stormwater catch basin located approximately 45 feet from the tank pad. The gasoline accumulated in this catch basin and then entered the outfall structure and traveled through the subgrade piping to a second catch basin. This process continued as the gasoline eventually accumulated in four consecutive on-site catch basins located to the north of the Turkey Hill store building. The fifth catch basin in the on-)t stprm se_w.er retork did riot contain an.y   indicating that the gasoline released at the site was contained on the Turkey Hill property and did not adversely affect any surface waters downgradient of the site.   Upon discovery of the release, the Hazle Township Fire Department was called to the site by Turkey Hill store employees. The fire department’s cleanup activities consisted primarily of applying granular adsorbent material to the ground surface. The fuel delivery company, Falcon Oil Company of Blakely, Pennsylvania, also retained SCE Environmental Group of Dickson City, Pennsylvania, to perform a cleanup of the spilled product. SCE’s activities, which were discussed with the DEP representatives present at the site, included flushing the on-site storm sewer system and recovering of the water and product mixture.   Strong petroleum odors were observed in the store building soon after the release occurred, indicating that some of the released product infiltrated into the subsurface, presumably through joints and cracks in the concrete and asphalt paving. Due to the elevated vapors, the building was evacuated. Measured volatile organic vapor concentrations in the building, as recorded by Liberty with a calibrated photoionization detector (PID), were as high as 60 parts per million (ppm). Screening of the tankfield observation wells for organic vapors yielded PID deflections of 2,518 ppm from OW-i and 2,145 ppm from OW-2.   Upon observing gasoline vapors in the store building, Turkey Hill retained Liberty to install a sub-slab vapor extraction (VE) system at the site to mitigate the intrusion of gasoline vapors into the building. The VE system included PVC piping running from beneath the building’s floor slab to the ground surface, a 1.5 horsepower blower, a moisture knockout vessel, and twin 55-gallon vapor—phase activated carbon drums in series. Upon startup of the VE system on the evening of March 17, 2010, vapors in the building diminished significantly and the store was able to reopen.   Liberty has been performing weekly operation and maintenance (O&M) of the VE system since its installation, O&M includes measuring and recording volatile organic vapor concentrations and air flow rates at","WE MET WITH EACH OF OUR DRIVERS AND WENT OVER PROCEDURE FOR DELIVERY.

At the gate, they were observed with a Portable Oxygen Concentrator (POC). When asked by the Frontier agent if it was a POC or if it was actual oxygen, they stated that it was a POC but then volunteered that she also had a bottle of oxygen in a black closed canvas bag she was carrying. The bottle was full, with the regulator on and valve closed.     The passengers were informed of the regulations regarding compressed gases. The passenger emptied the bottle but was unable to remove the valve/regulator to visually inspect the bottle as empty.  The passenger decided to leave the empty bottle in Denver and make arrangements to have it picked up and mailed to her home in Nashville on her way back through Denver on Saturday, March 6th.     The passengers stated that both gate agents and flight crew at BNA had said nothing about the bottle.  The DEN Frontier staff tried to assist the passenger in removing the top. They called maintenance to see if they had a wrench that would take it off, which they didn’t.     The agents provided the passengers with a printout of Frontier’s medical use oxygen policy from the website (www.frontierairlines.com).  They stated that the information was not what they saw earlier at the website.","1. This apparent violation involves a passenger (Janice Owens) who failed to notify Frontier Airlines that she was carrying medical use oxygen in addition to a Portable Oxygen Concentrator (POC).  The medical use oxygen policy for Frontier Airlines is as follows:     medical oxygen onboard  Cylinders of compressed or liquefied medical oxygen can't be accepted onboard or in checked baggage for any of our flights.      (http://www.frontierairlines.com/frontier/plan-book/travel-info-services/special-needs)    3.  As part of a Comprehensive fix, Frontier Airlines will provide notices and additional awareness training at call centers and passenger handling locations on the need to probe further into situations where a Portable Oxygen Concentrator is declared for carriage and use onboard by a passenger.    4. Primary responsibility for the monitoring and oversight of the proposed manual and training changes to create further awareness of hidden hazmats resides with the Director of Flight Operations safety and the Director of Operations for Frontier Airlines.",No,BAG CLOTH,Cloth or burlap bag (cont1 for solid materials),BAG CLTH,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Republic Airways Holdings (Parent Company),US,
