EVEN THOUGH THE TRAILER WAS EMPTY THE CORROSION STILL TOOK PLACE EATING A SMALL DIME SIZE HOLE IN THE BELLY OF THE TANK AT THE REAR.  THE DRIVER DID NOT NOTICE THE SMALL HOLE AND PROCEEDED TO KERR-MCGEE'S FACILITY IN SAVANNAH, GA TO BE LOADED.  THE OPERATOR AT KERR MCGEE GOT EVERYTHING READY TO START LOADING, WHILE THE DRIVER WAS STANDING BESIDE THE TRAILER THE OPERATOR TURNED THE PUMP ON TO LOAD.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY TOLD HIM TO SHUT IT BACK OFF. (ONLY A COUPLE OF SECONDS ELAPSED) THEY WENT TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER AND NOTICED A STEADY SMALL STREAM COMING FROM THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRAILER. THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY CALLED ME FOR INSTRUCTIONS.  I IMMEDIATELY ASKED + RECEIVED THE NAME AND A PHONE NUMBER OF A SUPERVISOR FOR THAT PARTICULAR LOADING STATION.  THE DRIVER INFORMED ME THAT THE TANK HAD STOPPED LEAKING AND WAS EMPTY.  I ASKED IF THEIR WAS ANYWAY PRODUCT COULD STILL BE IN THE FORWARD SECTION OF THE TANK.  HE REPLIED NO BECAUSE THE TANK WAS ON A GRADUAL PITCH TO THE REAR AND THAT ALL PRODUCT FORWARD OF THE HOLE WOULD RUN OUT OF THE HOLE AND THAT THE HOLE WAS ONLY ABOUT 4 INCHES FROM THE REAR, AND THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE REAR HEAD IN TAMPERED FORCING THE PRODUCT ALSO BACK TO THE HOLE.  I ASKED IF WE HAD ANY SOIL CONTAMINATION TO OCCUR. HE REPLIED NO.  ALL SPILLAGE IS CONTAINED IN THE CONCRETE LOADING PAD.  I ASKED HIM FOR AN ESTIMATED AMOUNT SPILT.  HE REPLIED 50 TO 55 GALLONS.  I IMMEDIATELY MADE CONTACT WITH THE SUPERVISOR IN CHARGE, AND ASKED HOW I COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE.  I OFFERED TO COME DOWN MYSELF TO ACCESS THE SITUATION, SEND A CLEAN-UP CREW, OR ANYTHING HE SUGGESTED.  HE REPLIED THAT NONE OF THAT IS NECESSARY.  THE LEAK IS COMPLETELY STOPPED, THE PRODUCT IS SAFETY CONTAINED, AND THAT IT WOULD ONLY TAKE A FEW BAGS OF SOMETHING TO NEUTRALIZE AND ABSORB WHAT HAD SPILLED.  I OFFERED TO PAY FOR ANY AND ALL CHARGES HE DEEMED NECESSARY FOR THE CLEAN-UP AND  DISPOSAL OF THE MATERIAL AND THE COST OF THE PRODUCT LOST.  HE REPLIED BY SAYING THAT THEIR WAS SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT LOST AND THAT CLEAN-UP TIME AND SUPPLIES WOULD BE SO MINIMAL THAT I NEED NOT TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING, HE HAD IT COVERED AND TAKEN CARE OF.  HE PROCEEDED TO THANK ME FOR THE QUICK ACTIONS OF MY DRIVER FOR ALERTING THE OPERATOR SO QUICKLY, THAT A POTENTIAL LARGER SITUATION WAS ABLE TO BE AVOIDED.  HE DID ASK ME IF I WOULD LEAVE THE TANKER THERE UNTIL THE HOLE COULD BE PATCHED BEFORE LEAVING THERE PROPERTY.  I AGREED.  THE TANK WAS PATCHED AND APPROVED FOR DEPARTURE FROM THEIR FACILITY.

THE BILEVEL SEPARATION CONSISTED OF 3/8 INCH PLYWOOD, WHICH WAS CUT SEVERAL INCHES SHORT, ALLOWING THE TOP TIER DRUMS TO OVER HANG THE PLYWOOD ON BOTH SIDES NEAR THE SIDE WALLS. THE BOTTOM TIER DRUMS HAD MOVED ROUGHLY 2 INCHES TOWARDS THE DOORWAY AS EVIDENCED BY THE EXTENSION OF THE BOTTOM TIER DRUMS PAST THE TOP TIER DRUMS. THERE WAS A TDI SENSOR PATCH APPLIED TO THE TY-PATCH AT THE REAR DOORS, WHICH HAD TURNED PINK,INDICATING THE TDI HAD BEEN PRESENT. A SHOCK SENSOR HAD BEEN APPLIED TO THE LEFT SIDE WALL NEAR THE REAR DOORS, WHICH HAD NOT BEEN ACTIVATED.

ONE WAS ROLLED ON CLINTON AVENUE AND THE OTHER WAS ROLLED AT 330TH STREET.  BOTH TANKS WERE LEAKING NH3, DUE TO DAMAGE TO THE FRONT VALVES AND BEING UPSIDE DOWN IN THE DITCH.  A 911 CALL WAS IMMEDIATELY PLACED TO DISPATCH THE REGION 5 HAZ MAT TEAM OUT OF FORT DODGE.  LOHRVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT TOOK CONTROL OF THE SCENE AND ESTABLISHED INCIDENT COMMAND.  A WRECKER WAS CALLED AND WHEN THE HAZ MAT TEAM ARRIVED WE WERE ABLE TO SET THE TANKS UPRIGHT WITH THE WRECKER.  THE TANKS WERE SET BACK ON THEIR WHEELS AND PULLED OUT INTO THE FIELD TO FINISH DISPENSING THE NH3 TO THE ATMOSPHERE. THE NH3 THAT WAS LOST WAS VENTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND WE DID NOT NEED TO CONTROL IT WITH WATER.  A TOTAL OF 8,420 POUNDS OF NH3 WAS RELEASED FROM BOTH TANKS; OF WHICH, 82% (6,904 POUNDS) WAS NITROGEN.  THE WIND WAS FROM THE NW AT MPH AND THE TEMPERATURE WAS 25.  NO ONE HAD TO BE EVACUATED AND NO FARM BUILDINGS HAD LIVESTOCK.  THE INCIDENT ENDED AT APPROXIMATELY 2 PM WITH AN EVALUATION THAT WE COULD NOT DO ANY FURTHER CLEAN UP AT THAT TIME. WE WILL EVALUATE THE SITES NEXT SPRING AND SEE IF WE NEED TO PROCEED FURTHER WITH ADDITIONAL CLEAN UP.  OUR BEST IDEA IS TO LET THE NH3 SPILL EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR SINCE IT WAS NOT CLOSE TO ANY WATERWAYS.  WE ARE STILL RECEIVING VERY LIMITED MOISTURE IN THAT AREA.
