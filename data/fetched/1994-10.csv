HOWEVER, AFTER THE TRAILER ARRIVED BACK AT N&M, FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY THE N&M SAFETY MANAGER REVEALED THAT THE BOTTOM OF THIS DRUM WAS CORRODED, AND AS A RESULT, A CRACK DEVELOPED IN THE BOTTOM CENTER OF THE DRUM.  THE LEAKING PRODUCT WAS CONFINED TO A 5 FT AREA OF THE TRAILER FLOOR.  ONCCE THE PAPER PRODUCT WAS REMOVED FROM THE TRAILER, FLOOR DRY WAS USED TO ABSORB THE LIQUID.

UNIT 1 LEFT THE ROADWAY AFTER LOSING CONTROL OF HIS VEHICLE, STRUCK AN EARTH EMBANKMENT, OVERTUNED ON ITS SIDE, AND CAME TO FINAL REST AGAINST THE EARTH EMBANKMENT, ON THE SOUTHBOUND SIDE OF INTERSTATE 75. THE CAUSE OF UNIT 1 LOSING CONTROL OF HIS VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION AT THIS TIME. IT HAS BEEN STATED BY AT LEAST ONE WITNESS THAT THE OPERATOR OF UNIT 1 INDICATED THAT HE WAS OVERCOME BY FUMES FROM THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL THAT HE WAS TRANSPORTING, AND THIS CAUSED HIM TO LOSE CONTROL OF HIS VEHICLE. THIS CLAIM IS CURRENTLY UNSUBSTANTIATED, AND IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. SEVERAL WITNESS INTERVIEWS ARE STILL PENDING, AS IS A STATEMENT FROM THE OPERATOR OF UNIT 1. AN EXAMINATION OF THE ROADWAY ON 10-30-94, SHOWED NO VISIBLE TIRE MARKS OR OTHER PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT UNIT 1 MADE ANY PRE-IMPACT MANUEVERING OR BRAKING. NO OTHER VEHICLES WERE STRUCK BY UNIT 1, AND UNIT 1 WAS REMOVED FROM ITS AREA OF FINAL REST BEFORE I WAS PERMITTED TO EXAMINE THE ACCIDENT SCENE. THIS WAS DUE TO THE RISK OF THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL UNIT 1 WAS CARRYING. A THOROUGH EXAMINATION AND INSPECTION OF UNIT 1 IS ALSO NOT POSSIBLE DUE TO THE RISK OF POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION FROM THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. THE SHIPPING PAPERS AND LOG BOOK FOR UNIT 1 ARE SUPPOSELY STILL INSIDE THE VEHICLE. EXAMINATION AND PHOTOGRAPHING OF THE SCENE AND UNIT WERE NOT POSSIBLE AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, DUE TO THE RISK OF THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL, NOR WERE MEASUREMENTS. ALL MEASUREMENTS WILL BE RUDIMENTARY AND APPROXIMATE. I WAS UNABLE TO LOCATE OR IDENTIFY ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE TO PREPARE SPEED ESTIMATES AND AREA OF IMPACT AND FINAL REST WILL ALSO BE APPROXIMATE. WITHOUT AN INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE, I WILL ALSO BE UNABLE TO DETERMINE IF ANY MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION RESULTED IN UNIT 1'S LOSS OF CONTROL, AND CAUSED THE ACCIDENT. SEVERAL INTERVIEWS ARE STILL PENDING, AND THE LIST OF WITNESSES I HAVE PROVIDED MAY BE ADDED TO, OR DELETED FROM, BASED ON THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDE ME. THEY WERE GIVEN TO ME AS POSSIBLE WITNESSES AND WILL BE INTERVIEWED AND THEIR STATEMENTS ADDED TO SUPPLEMENTARIES OF THIS REPORT. AN INTERVIEW WITH THE OPERATOR OF UNIT 1 IS ALSO STILL PENDING. DUE TO HIS INJURIES, AN INTERVIEW WAS NOT POSSIBLE AT THE TIME THAT THIS REPORT WAS FILED. A CHEMICAL TEST WAS NOT CONDUCTED ON THE OPERATOR OF UNIT 1, SINCE DURING THE INTERVIEWS WITH EMS PERSONNEL, THEY INDICATED TO ME THAT THEY DETECTED NO ODOR OR PRESENCE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE ON OR ABOUT THE PERSON OF THE OPERATOR OF UNIT 1. THE OBSERVATIONS I WAS ABLE TO MAKE ALSO GAVE ME NO INDICATIONS OF POSSIBLE ALCOHOL INVOLVEMENT. THE OPERATOR OF UNIT 1 WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE BEREA HOSPITAL AND THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE U.K. MEDICAL CENTER IN LEXINGTON, KY. FOR FURTHER TREATMENT.

THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED ON THE EAST BOUND I-10 FREEWAY BETWEEN DUDLEY STREET AND GAREY AVENUE IN THE CITY OF POMONA, CA; AT APPROXIMATELY 8:00 A.M. KENNY DIAZ (SUN-RAY TESTING EMPLOYEE) WAS ON HIS WAY TO NORTHWEST PIPE AND CASING CO. IN ADELANTO, CA. (B).  THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY A BLOWOUT IN THE RIGHT REAR TIRE ON ONE OF OUR FIELD RADIOGRAPHY UNITS.  THE BLOWOUT DESTROYED THE TIRE AND THE TRUCK WAS RUNNING ON THE TIRE RIM ONLY. AS THE DRIVER WAS STEERING THE TRUCK TO THE RIGHT EMERGENCY LANE THE TRUCK STARTED SWAYING BACK AND FORTH AND TIPPED ON IT'S LEFT (DRIVER) SIDE AND SKIDDED ACROSS THE FREEWAY AND INTO THE CONCRETE RETAINING WALL, IN THE PROCESS THE DARKROOM (CAMPER) BROKE AWAY FROM THE TRUCK.  WHEN THE TRUCK HIT THE RETAINING WALL, THE IMPACT WITH THE WALL PUT THE TRUCK BACK ON IT'S WHEELS.  THE TIRE THAT FAILED WAS IN GOOD CONDITION PRIOR TO THE BLOWOUT.  (C)  NO OTHER VEHICLE WAS INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT.  (D) THE TRUCK WAS CARRYING A 73 CURIE SOURCE OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL, IRIDIUM 192. THE SEALED SOURCE WAS IN A AMERTEST MODEL 660 B GAMMA RAY PROJECTOR S/N B2136, TYPE-B SHIPPING CONTAINER.  AS SOON AS THE DRIVER GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK HE SURVEYED THE PORTABLE DARKROOM WHICH CONTAINED THE SOURCE AND HE FOUND THE READINGS TO BE NORMAL.  HE CALLED THE A.R.S.O., BERT JERSILD (FROM A MOTORIST CELLULAR CAR PHONE) AND REPORTED THE ACCIDENT, HE ALSO CALLED THE C.H.P. AND REPORTED THE ACCIDENT AND THAT THE TRUCK CONTAINED RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL AND THAT A SURVEY OF THE RADIOACTIVE SOURCE INDICATED THE AREA WAS SAFE.  (F) BERT JERSILD (SUN-RAY TESTING A.R.S.O.) DISPATCHED CLIFF BARBER, A.S.R.T. SENIOR RADIOGRAPHER TO THE ACCIDENT SCENE IN A FIELD RADIOGRAPHY UNIT TO PICK UP THE RADIOACTIVE SOURCE.  (G) THE C.H.P., FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE HAZ-MET PERSONNEL DECIDED TO SHUT DOWN THE FREEWAY TO ASSURE SAFETY.  SUN-RAY TESTING PERSONNEL ASSURED THEM THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER TO THE PUBLIC BUT IT DID NOT CHANGE THEIR MINDS.  (H) AT THE ACCIDENT SCENE, CLIFF BARBER (S.R.T.) USING THE HAZ-MET CHIEFS CAR PHONE, TALKED TO A LADY FROM THE COUNTY RADIOLOGIC HEALTH DEPT.  (CLIFF THOUGHT HE WAS TALKING TO A LADY FROM THE STATE RADIOLOGIC HEALTH OFFICE) AND BASED ON WHAT HE TOLD HER THE AUTHORITIES DECIDED TO LET CLIFF REMOVE THE RADIOACTIVE SOURCE FROM THE FIELD DARK ROOM AND EXAMINE IT.  THE OUTER TRANSPORT BOX AND THE PROJECTOR WERE NOT DAMAGED.  APPROXIMATELY TWO (2) HOURS AFTER ARRIVING AT THE ACCIDENT SCENE CLIFF WAS ALLOWED TO RETURN TO SUN-RAY TESTING OFFICE WITH THE SOURCE.

WHICH CAUSED TRUCK AND TRAILER TO LAY OVER ON IT'S LEFT SIDE. CYPRUS BAGDAD CO. USED A VACUVATOR TO CLEAN-UP SPILL PLUS A CLEAN-UP CREW. THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNTS OF COPPER AND LEAD SULFIDE RELEASED IN THE CONCENTRATE TRUCK SPILL ON OCTOBER 20, 1994. (SEE ATTACHED). THE AUGUST COMPOSITE SAMPLE RESULTS FOR LEAD SULFIDE AND COPPER WERE USED TO CALCULATE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF BOTH SUBSTANCES. THE AMOUNT OF LEAD SULFIDE IN THE CONCENTRATE IS EXTREMELY VARIABLE. THEREFORE, WE HAVE REQUESTED THAT A SAMPLE BE RUN FOR THE EXACT AMOUNT OF LEAD SULFIDE. THIS OPERATION WILL TAKE 1-2 HOURS. THE CONCENTRATE WEIGHTED 49,650 LBS. APPROXIMATELY 10,000 LBS REMAINS IN THE TRUCK WHICH IS ON ITS SIDE. WE WILL ATTEMPT TO RECOVER THIS AMOUNT USING A VACUUM TRUCK. IF UNSUCCESSFUL, ADDITIONAL CONCENTRATE WILL BE LOST. USING THE ENTIRE WEIGHT OF THE CONCENTRATE AND THE AUGUST COMPOSITE NUMBER OF .03 PERCENT LEAD SULFIDE, 14.7 LBS OF LEAD SULFIDE HAVE BEEN SPILLED. USING A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF 8,OOO LBS RECOVERED (NOT RELEASED) FROM THE TRUCK BODY, 12.5 LBS OF LEAD SULFIDE HAVE BEEN SPILLED. THEREFORE, THE REPORTABLE QUANTITY OF 10 LBS MAY HAVE BEEN EXCEEDED. APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT OF THE COPPER IN THE CONCENTRATE RUNS BELOW 250 MESH IN SIZE WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT TO THE .004 INCH EXEMPTION FROM REPORTING. USING THE ABOVE FIGURES FOR AMOUNT RELEASED FROM THE TRUCK, 3150 LBS OF COPPER METAL ARE RELEASED IF NO RECOVERY OF CONCENTRATE IS MADE AND 2643 LBS OF COPPER ARE RELEASED IF 8000 LBS ARE RECOVERED. THEREFORE, THE REPORTABLE QUANTITY OF 5000 LBS HAS NOT BEEN EXCEEDED. MR. WALTER RUSNIEK OF KIMBALL AND CURRY IS LOOKING INTO THE SUBJECT OF REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY AND WILL BE DOCUMENTING THIS TODAY.

NS MECHANICAL SUPERVISORS CONDUCTED INSPECTION OF CAR AND COULD FIND NO DETECTABLE LEAK.  CARRIER PERSONNEL DISCUSSED MATTER WITH CONSIGNEE REPRESENTATIVE (BF GOODRICH, AVON LAKE, OH).  CAR WAS DETERMINED TO BE NOT LEAKING AND SECURE.  IT WAS MOVED TO FINAL DESTINATION.  FRA INSPECTOR JOE CONNELLY CALLED NS TERMINAL SUPERINTENDENT ON 10/19/94 AND ADVISED THAT NS HAD MOVED A LEAKING TANK CAR FROM INSPECTIONS BY MECHANICAL SUPERVISORS REVEALED NO DISCERNABLE RELEASE OF PRODUCT.  ON 10/20/94, TWO DAYS AFTER THE ALLEGED INCIDENT, FRA INSPECTORS CONNELLY AND NIGORSKI INSPECTED TANK CAR AT BF GOODRICH FACILITY IN AVON LAKE AND CLAIMED THAT THE CAR HAD A LEAK.  THEY REPORTED BEING ABLE TO PARTIALLY TURN A BOLT ON TOP OF THE CAR.  CARRIER CONTACTED BF GOODRICH REP DAN COLLINS AND WAS TOLD THAT BF GOODRICH WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED THE CAR TO BE LEAKING.  NO WRITTEN REPORTS WERE SUBMITTED TO THE CARRIER BY FRA AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, AND CARRIER DID NOT FILE DOT F5800.1.  THE SITUATION WAS DISCUSSED AT A 01/11/95 MEETING IN CLEVELAND AMONG FRA INSPECTORS CONNELLY AND NIGORSKI, MEMBERS OF NS HAZMAT DEPT., BELLEVUE TERMINAL SUPT., AND THE SHIPPER. DURING THIS MEETING, WE WERE ADVISED THAT HOECHST CELANESE WAS UNABLE TO CONDUCT A THROROUGH INVESTIGATION ON THIS CAR BECAUSE OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC DERAILED AND DAMAGED THE EMPTY CAR WHICH WAS RETURNING TO BAYPORT, TX.  HOECHST CELANESE ALSO STATED THAT THE ODOR OF THIS PRODCUT COULD BE DETECTED UP TO 15 DAYS AFTER IT CAME IN CONTACT WITH A CAR, AND THAT A ODOR SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE CONSIDERED AS AN ""ACTIVE"" RELEASE. ALTHOUGH CARRIER ASSERTS THAT TANK CAR CELX 11258 WAS NOT LEAKING @ BELLEVUE, OH, ON 10/18/94 WHEN RELEASED FOR MOVEMENT TO AVON LAKE, WE HAVE NO REASON TO QUESTION THE OBSERVATION REPORTED BY MESSRS. CONNELLY AND NIGORSKI.  FOR THIS REASON, WE ARE SUBMITTING A DOT F5800.1 REPORT FOR THE INCIDENT AT AVON LAKE.
