THE VEHICLE WAS AN APRIA HEALTHCARE, ISUZU FRR UNIT #21732. THE LEAK WAS FOUND TO BE A COMING FROM THE NON-SPECIFICATION CARGO TANK, HL190, SERIAL #449, MOUNTED IN THE VEHICLE.  CHRIS CRUZ HAD JUST PULLED UP TO 18026 N CAVE CREEK, SCOTTSDALE, AZ TO MAKE A DELIVERY.  HE PARKED THE TRUCK AND UPON OPENING THE SIDE DOOR FOUND THE LEAK.  HE CHECKED THE AREA FOR ANY OPEN FLAMES OR PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC.  HE THEN OPENED THE REAR DOOR OF THE TRUCK'S BOX SO THAT THE OXYGEN VAPOR WOULD EVAPORATE.  HE CONTACTED HIS OFFICE IN PHOENIX AND REQUESTED A SUPERVISOR COME TO THE SCENE.  DUE TO THE OPERATION OF THE ROAD RELIEF VALVE AND THE LEAK THE PRESSURE IN THE CARGO TANK RAPIDLY DROPPED AND THE LEAK STOPPED.  UPON ARRIVAL OF TRANSPORTATION LEAD, JEFF CUTBIRTH, THEY EXAMINED THE CARGO TANK AND VERIFIED THAT THE LEAK HAD STOPPED.  THEY WAITED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES TO PROVIDE AMPLE TIME FOR THE OXYGEN CONCENTRATION TO DISSIPATE.  THE TRUCK WAS THEN RETURNED TO THE OFFICE WHERE IT WAS SECURED PENDING ARRIVAL OF THE TANK REPAIR TECHNICIAN.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY 9 GALLONS OF OXYGEN, REFRIGERATED LIQUID HAD BEEN RELEASED.  THERE WAS NO COLLATERAL DAMAGE AND NO INJURIES INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT.  THE TANK WAS INSPECTED AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE HAD FAILED.

THE BOX CONTINUED TO SMOLDER AND FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TO HOUSTON CITY OPERATIONS PERSONNEL AND FAA HAZMAT SPECIALIST, J R CRAIG WERE ONSITE.  PICTURES WERE TAKEN AND FULL REPORT GIVEN TO INSPECTOR CRAIG.   CARGO CONTAINER WAS MOVED TO A SHADED AREA WHERE IT COULD BE OBSERVED.  THE REMAINING CONTENTS OF THE BURNT BOX WAS COLLECTED AND SITED AS REQUESTED BY INSPECTOR CRAIG.  AT ABOUT 1830 CST, SMOKE WAS ONCE AGAIN SEEN COMING FROM THE TOP OF THE LD-11 CONTAINER.  UPON OPENING CONTAINER, A SECOND BOX WAS FOUND SMOLDERING.  FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED AGAIN AND EXTINGUISHED THIS SMOKING BOX.  AT THAT TIME, IT WAS DECIDED TO PLACE THIS CONTAINER INSIDE THE COOLER LOCATED IN THE DOMESTIC CARGO FACILITY.  PRODUCT NEVER DID CATCH FIRE - IT JUST SEEMED TO MELT, SMOLDER AND SMOKE BADLY WHEN EXPOSED TO THE AIR.  THE CONTAINER WAS PLACED IN THE COOLER, ALONG WITH ALL THE DAMAGED, BURNT AND MELTED REMAINS AT ABOUT 2000 CST.  AT ABOUT 2130 CST, A THIRD BOX WAS FOUND TO BE SMOLDERING. THIS BOX WAS REMOVED AND THE SMOLDERING BOX WAS EXTINGUISHED WITH LOCAL FIRE EXTINGUISHERS.  FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT CALLED AT THIS TIME.  THE CONTINENTAL AIRLINES ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENT DISPATCHED EAGLE CONSTRUCTION TO HANDLE THE CLEAN UP OF THIS INCIDENT AS WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH EAGLE CONSTRUCTION TO DISPOSE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.  ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTATION, THERE WERE 36 BOXES OF BLEACHING POWDER THAT WAS PACKAGED IN TWO CLEAR PLASTIC BAGS.  THE SMOLDERING DESTROYED 3 BOXES OF BLEACHING POWDER.  6 BOXES HAD ALREADY BEEN FORWARDED TO DESTINATION ON A PREVIOUS FLIGHT AND ARRIVED IN JFK WITHOUT INCIDENT.  THESE 6 BOXES HAVE BEEN ISOLATED IN THE COOLER IN JFK AND HAVE GIVEN NO INDICATION OF ANY FURTHER REACTION.  THE REMAINING 27 BOXES OF BLEACHING POWDER WERE OPENED AND THE CONTENTS PLACED INTO 55-GALLON DRUMS AND REMOVED FROM THE SITE BY EAGLE CONSTRUCTION.  THE BALANCE OF THE SHIPMENT WAS RELEASED BY THE FAA FOR FORWARDING TO DESTINATION.  ON JUNE 25, 2003, A SAMPLE OF THE POWDER WAS FORWARDED TO A LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS.  THE BALANCE OF THE SHIPMENT IS NOW COMPLETE IN JFK (EXCEPT FOR THE BLEACHING POWDER) AND HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD BY THE U S CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION ANTI-TERRORISM TEAM.

IT WAS FOUND THAT A SECTION APPROX. 3"" IN LENGTH OF A SMALL STEAM LINE HAD BEEN PINCHED BETWEEN THE LEG AND SUMP FLANGES.  IT WAS THEORIZED THAT THIS WAS THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE FOR THE LEAK.  THIS WAS THE FIRST RIP SINCE PROFESSIONAL WELDERS CO. HAD DONE SOME WORK ON THE TRAILER.  IT WAS THEORIZED THAT WHEN THE VALVE WAS REINSTALLED THE LINE HAD BEEN PINCHED. THE TRAILER HAD PASSED A PRESSURE TEST BECAUSE THE GASKET HAD SEALED AGAINST THE LINE AND FLANGE BUT THAT WHEN THE TANK WAS LOADED AND IN TRANSIT THE FLEXING OF THE TANK WORKED THE LINE LOSE AND TORE THE GASKET CREATING THE LEAK.  07/01/03.
