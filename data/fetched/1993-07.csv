THE WASTE INVOLVED WAS A SPENT PICKLE LIQUOR (HAZARDOUS WASTE NO K062) FROM THE ALLENPORT PLANT OF WHEELING-PITTSBURGH STEEL CORPORATION BEING TRANSPORTED UNDER MANIFEST NO PAE0243865 (COPY ATTACHED).  APPROXIMATELY 1 QUART (2.6 POUNDS) OF WASTE WAS INVOLVED IN THE RELEASE, RESULTING IN AN INTERNITTEN STAIN ON THE SURFACE OF SR 3059 AND SR 3061 FROM A POINT APPROXIMATEY 800 FEET SOUTH OF THE INTERSECTION OF THESE TWO ROADS TO THE PLANT. OUR INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT INDICATED THAT THE RELEASE OCCURED FROM THE TANKER DISCHARGE ASSEMBLY.  BOTH THE MANUALLY-OPERATED AND AIR-OPERATED VALVES WERE FOUND TO BE SLIGHTELY A JAR AND THE THREADED JOINT THAT HOLDS THE CAP ONTO THE OUTLET END OF THE PIPE WAS LOOSE.  THE RELEASE WAS APPARENTLY TRIGGERED WHEN THE VEHICLE MOMENTARILY LEFT THE ROAD SURFACE ALONG SR 3061 NEAR WHERE THE RELEASE BEGAN.  NO EVIDENCE OF ANY STAINING ON THE ROAD SURFACE WAS EVIDENT SOUTH OF THAT LOCATION.  FURTHER, THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE INDICATED THAT AN INSPECTION OF THE ASSEMBLY PERFORMED ONLY MINUTES BEFORE THE RELEASE REVEALED NOTHING AWRY.  IN RESPONSE TO THE RELEASE, A STREET SWEEPER WAS CALLED TO THE SCENE AND ROAD SURFACE WET-VACUUMED ON JULY 2, 1993.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT ANY OF THE RELEASED WASTE OR THE WATER USED IN THE CLEANING PROCESS LEFT THE ROAD SURFACE.  ALL OF THE MATERIAL CLEANED FROM THE ROAD SURFACE WAS DELIVERED TO THE YUKON PLANT, TREATED AND DISPOSED.  IT IS OUR OPINION THAT NO ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT OR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY OR WELFARE RESULTED FROM THE RELEASE.  CLOSE INSPECTION OF THE DISCHARGE ASSEMBLY ON THE VEHICLE REVEALED BOTH DISCHARGE VALVES TO BE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND FULLY CAPABLE OF CONTAINING THE WASTE.  IN ADDITION, THE CAP, AFTER TIGHTENING, WAS FOUND TO BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY EQUIPMENT MODIFICATIONS ARE WARRANTED AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER, THE IN-TRANSIT INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS OF THE TRANSPORTER CONTINGENCY PLAN HAVE BEEN REVISED TO INCLUDE AN INSPECTION OF ALL CLOSURE DEVICES ON THE WASTE TRANSPORT VEHICLES TO CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE SECURE.  ALL DRIVERS WILL RECEIVE TRAINING CONCERNING THIS ADDITIONAL INSPECTION REQUIREMENT.
