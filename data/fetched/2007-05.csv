The drum was transported to the destination facility without incident. As the vehicle was being off-loaded it was discovered that pressure had built up inside the 85 gallon drum sufficient enough to cause the lid to come off and a spraying of some material was observed within the vehicle. After contacting the shipper, it was learned that the sodium hydroxide solution was used to clean aluminum materials, which is not compatible with the sodium hydroxide. It is believed that the overpacking of the 55 gallon drum agitated some residual aluminum material in the container which then reacted with the sodium hyderoxide to build up pressure until the lid was compromised. The material was then stabilized and recontainerized prior to shipping offsite for disposal.",We have discussed the incident with the shipper.

When the origin shut the door this caused the drum to crush.    There was a small amount of liquid on the trailer floor and a small amount on the ground.  The drum was overpacked and spill cleaned up with floor dry.,To me the trailer was to full to put this drum on.  The yardman would have to use extra force to shut the door.

This highway is a two lane non-divided road.  The conditions were clear, and no other vehicles were traveling on the road at the time of the accident.  The driver was traveling westbound on highway 54.  As the vehicle reached a left hand curve the driver failed to negotiate the maneuver.  The trailer’s right front tires went off the right shoulder causing the tractor to go off the right side of the road as well.  Both vehicles struck trees that were lining the road and finally the trailer rolled over on its right hand side.      The Collins Fire Department, Missouri State Highway Patrol, Sunbelt Environmental Services, and an independent adjustor representing Great West Casualty Company all responded to the scene.  The highway was never closed during any time of the clean up process.  The clean up required the load to be off loaded into a relief trailer in order to clear the scene.  Erickson Transport supplied the relief trailer and driver.  Sunbelt Environmental transferred the product by cold tapping the damaged trailer and pumping the product into the relief trailer.  After the transfer was complete it allowed the wrecker service to clear the area of the damaged vehicles.  During the clean up process the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) was contacted, their spill number is 070529-1015-CRJ. MDNR did not find it necessary to conduct a further investigation at the scene.  There was no product loss as result of the accident or during the transfer, the only product that was released was eight ounces that was collected in a container placed under the dome lid.       The conclusion of the state highway’s investigation and the independent adjustor’s report ruled the cause of the accident was due to inattention from the driver.  The driver received a citation for failure to maintain present lane.  Due to the circumstances and physical evidence there were no other mitigating factors.  To clarify the response to question 25 there was no failure of the equipment, there was no release of product.  The failure was the drivers action, no mechanical failure occurred.","Due to the cause of the accident all corrective actions deal with education and retraining.  The employment of the driver involved in this accident was terminated because of the results of the investigations and the severity of the accident.     A major part of education and training is our safety meeting.  At the next safety meeting, which will be held in August, this accident will be covered extensively with all drivers from the events leading up to the accident, the damages, root cause and cost incurred.  Another aspect of this accident is the routing, we will discuss with the drivers what they feel is the safest routing and establish that as the desired route for that delivery.  All of this will be done to illustrate to the drivers how their actions directly affect their safety, the safety of others on the road, and the dangers of the job.  We also do this because the drivers are more receptive and learn more when we share problems that their peers may be having.  This also reiterates that situations like this can happen to anyone of them, keeping them from becoming complacent.         Due to the importance of these safety meetings we ensure that the message and discussion is not soon forgotten.  After each meeting a letter is sent out to each driver, no matter if they attended the meeting or not.  This letter reviews the topics discussed and notifies them if there attendance was excused or not.  If a driver is able to attend a meeting due to work restrictions then a individual meeting is arranged with the safety manager.      Each month a handout that is put together by the National Tank Truck Carriers and JJ Keller is distributed to the drivers.  This hand out covers the topic of rollovers every other month, the other months it covers other safety related topics.  Attached to the handout is a quiz which the drivers complete and return to the safety department.  This program prior to the accident was not formalized, however with this accident it will be formally implemented into the safety program.       Finally we will review rollover training that is used during driver orientation.  Presently the drivers watch a video on rollover situations and take a quiz.  We will work with our insurance agent’s safety department to make improvements.  With these changes, education, and keeping this unfortunate incident in front of the drivers we feel that management and the drivers will be able to prevent this type of accident from reoccurring.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,67568,"K-Limited Carrier, LTD.",US,

Drum appears to have been punctured when the farm equipment shifted in transit and banged against the drums, bending many and puncturing one.  Our shipping and receiving staff noticed the odor and the leaking drum before we handled a drum.  NEMF unloaded drums.    Cleanup:    Very little leaked.  The drum was placed on a containment pallet and the contents were transferred into another container.  No measurable amount of contents was lost.  Absorbent was placed on the trailer bed and swept up.  No measurable amount of contents was absorbed.    Environmental Damage:    A trace amount of the contents evaporated.     No hazardous material reached a waterway, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, or the ground.","This is the second incident in 18 months, with the same players.  Ashland palletized shipments of the drums, but NEMF allowed farm equipment to be placed too close to the drums and the equipment damaged several drums, including puncturing one.    Spartech instituted several measures that help eliminate human exposure and limit environmental exposure.  Spill kits, including the containment pallet was available at the dock.

While traveling on Highway 60, just west of Seiling, Oklahoma, the Exide Technologies driver lost control of the vehicle, which caused the truck to rollover into the embankment.  The tractor-trailer unit was hauling 538 batteries at the time of the incident.  Approximately 50 gallons of battery acid were released.  The Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, Oklahoma Department of Transportation, Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Woodward Fire Department, and Mooreland Fire Department responded to the site.  Boomer Environmental of Midwest City, Oklahoma was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, Boomer Environmental offloaded some of the damaged batteries from the trailer, in an effort to assist the Wrecking Company in removing the vehicle from the embankment.  Upon uprighting the damaged vehicle, Boomer Environmental neutralized the free product on the affected roadway, and began to excavate the impacted soils from the embankment and road shoulder.  Boomer Environmental also proceeded to offload all batteries, deconned, shrink-wrapped, and repalletized.  Disposition was coordinated directly by Exide Technologies.  The contaminated soil, debris, and neutralized product were placed into a rolloff box, which were transported for disposal, in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.  Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality oversaw cleanup activity, and site was cleared for closure.

He then checked the 3 IBC's of SBS 38% on his truck and noticed that the IBC in question appeared to have started to weep some product as the bottom of the packaging had a small amount of material in the sump of the bin.  I contacted another company driver that was close by and we decided that since the bin was not leaking, but rather weeping, we could transport back to the branch as the truck was within 40 miles.  The drivers had estimated less than a gallon was in the bottom of the IBC when the truck arrived back at the branch.  The IBC was placed in our portable IBC recovery area until we were able to empty the bin.  We weighted the IBC and based on the weight, the IBC had leaked a total of 6 gallons of material from the time the driver discovered the situation until we weighted the bin, some 4 hours later.  The truck was loaded and secured as policy states and was not weeping when the load was checked before the driver left the branch.  After we unloaded the IBC, we found that a small stress crack had developed on the bottom of the bin.  The IBC was taken out of service by the testing branch.","After an investigation was completed, we felt as if the IBC developed a stress crack as result of age.  The Corporate policy was to purchase a more expensive, higher quality IBC for select products and that has been quite sucessful, since implimented last year. Based on this incident, during the next conference call, a decision will be made on the continued use of the Claswon IBC's we have in service for other hazardous materials such as SBS 38%. The IBC in question passed the required DOT testing requirement a month before this incident.  Based on pass records, the Clawon IBC's have been reliable and we had few incidents with them as result of age but rather most issues were due to the treatment and storage.",No,IBC,"Composite, with plastic inner liner, for liquids",31HH1,Yes,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA,US,

When the driver who was assisting in the fill process opened the valve on the truck mounted tank to begin filling the customer’s tank the hose separated from the inlet connection on the customer’s tank and vented the liquid C02 from the truck mounted tank. The truck mounted tank was allowed to empty completely due to the fact that the fill hose was gyrating in an uncontrolled manner which made it unsafe to approach the shut off valve for the truck mounted tank until the pressure was reduced in the truck mounted tank sufficiently to close the shut off valve. The failure occurred at the point of connection on the customer’s tank. Our follow up investigation was inconclusive as to the exact cause of the failure.,We have performed additional training and reviewed proper filling procedures with particular emphasis on secure fill hose/tank connections with the driver involved.

Eagle management instructed him to contact Motiva Scheduling and report it to them, which he did and received a release #1-2347087891  from Harding. He also stated the reason for the release was because he misread the polecat and thought the product would fit.     Eagle Management met with the store owner and inspected the area around the drop site and found standing product in the expansion joints of the concrete pad. We spread kitty litter which soaked that up. We inspected a storm drain that was in the path of the release and found no product had reached it. We also inspected three monitoring wells and they did not show evidence of product in them.

The poly drum was on a drum dolly and was being moved over the edge of the driveway onto the customer site when it bounced up a bit when going over the driveway edge and one of the dolly's feet put a small hole about 1/4"" x 1"" in size in the bottom of the drum.  The drum was immediately placed on its side and moved onto the customer site. The duration of teh spill lasted approxamately 20 seconds. The spilled liquid was absorbed by absorbent from the driver's spill kit on the truck.  Two more Univar employees were sent to the site to assist in the final clean up.  The customer wanted to keep the drum and was able to use the material.","The drum should have been wheeled, on the drum dolly, to the lip of the customer's driveway and set down on the street side.  Then the dolly should have been brought around to the driveway side and the drum picked up with the dolly and wheeled to the customer.  The process should have been completed using a two-step process instead of a one-step process.

The drum was then transported over the ocean on 5/7/2007 by Crowley Liner Services to the Port of Philadelphia.  The trailer was then transported on 5/23/2007 by Environmental Transport Group Inc. and delivered to the Veolia TSDF located in Flanders, NJ on 5/25/2007.    When the drum was off-loaded by Veolia receiving employees, it was identified as bulged and completely empty.  There was approximately <1 gallon of material residue on the floor of the trailer around the drum that required cleaning.  An investigation determined that the drum was shipped from Puerto Rico containing 55 gallons of waste material.  We believe pressure built up during transportation due to temperature change which caused the drum to develop a hole and leak the entire contents of the drum.

The conductor tied a hand brake on car ACFX 200359 and the engineer pushed it approximately 5 car lengths to a stop as the cdr. walked along side the car.  The cdr. then had the engineer push on the car, and cut the car off from the movement.  The car sat momentarily on the yard track and then began to roll in a northward direction.  The cdr. reboarded the car and attempted to tighten the handbrake to no avail.  He then dismounted from the car and asked the engineer to come ahead and try to ""catch"" the car.  The car was rolling down a .07 grade and the train was unable to catch up with it.  It subsequently derailed on the derailing device that protects the main track at the north end of the yard.  The tank car rolled onto it's side.  The cdr. and a car department supervisor rushed to the scene with empty fuel cans and began to catch a small stream of diesel fuel that was coming from the vent valve on top of the railcar.  The train dispatcher was notified via emergency radio communication and he subsequently nofitied the St. Albans Fire Dept. and The State Of Vermont Environmental Dept.  R. J. Corman Rerailing Services came in and rerailed the car between 7:00PM and midnight.  The tank car was not breached in anyway.  The safety devices were repaired on the railcar and it was sent to it's final destination for unloading.  After unloading, it will be sent to it's ""Home Shop"" for final repairs.  Upon inspection by the mechanical department, a broken weld on the slack adjuster for the brake system was found on this car.  This allowed excessive piston travel and made the braking system ineffective.","The employee involved in the incident is scheduled for a hearing.

ENGINEER, DANGEROUS GOODS COMPLIANCE",4333 Amon Carter Blvd,FORT WORTH,TX,76155,Carrier,"Upon arrival of AA flight 605 into San Juan (SJU) on the night of May 11, 2007, the Fleet Service Clerks noticed a bag was ""smoking"" when they moved it to off load it in the cargo hold of the aircraft.  Per procedure, they exited the cargo compartment and alerted their Supervisor.  The Supervisor contacted the Lead Environmental Coordinator who responded from her home.  Upon arrival and inspecting the scene, she noticed a smell.  She commented that it smelled like muratic acid.    The roll-aboard type bag was removed from the aircraft and opened for inspection.  Inside were 19 bottles of product.  The bottles were labeled; Barnacle Cleaner, All Purpose Degreaser and Cleaner,  Step 2, Step 3 and Sealer.    The passenger had connected on to another flight.  The Lead Environmental Coordinator took possession of the bag and its contents to keep for FAA inspection and the FAA Hazmat office in SJU was advised.    An AA Aircraft Maintenance Supervisor removed a floorboard where the bag had been sitting and a sidewall panel since the bag had also been against that area.  An inspection was performed of the insulation blankets below the floor board and behind the sidewall panel and no evidence of acid was found.  The Supervisor treated the floorboard and panel with baking soda and reinstalled them.  The aircraft was returned to service.    Upon the return flight of the customer, further contact information was obtained to provide to the FAA Hazmat Inspector.  American Airlines Dangerous Goods Compliance and Maintenance and Engineering were both trying to obtain the MSDS (sheets) for the chemicals in the bag.  We were unsuccessful until we were finally able to contact the customer in Fort Lauderdale (FLL) several days later.  The MSDS (sheets) the customer faxed indicated that the Barnacle Remover contained Rust X which contained Corrosive Liquid, Acidic, Inorganic, n.o.s., 8, UN3264, PG III, (Hydrochloric Acid) Cleaning Compound.    Although the Barnacle Remover product did not indicate any of this on the label, the instructions included a warning that said, ""Do not use on soft metals, such as aluminum.""    FAA Hazmat Inspector John Connally from the SJU office visited the Lead Environmental Coordinator at SJU Airport and obtained all the necessary information.    This event was also reported by American Airlines Dangerous Goods Compliance to the Southwest Region FAA Hazmat Office in Fort Worth, Texas.","The TSA allowed this through in FLL.  It did NOT have any markings on it to indicate that it contained Hazmat.  Perhaps a name like Barnacle Cleaner would indicate that it is a fairly strong substance.  This might be one ""trigger"" to the agents that something is not correct.  The second ""trigger"" is that there were 19 Quart bottles in a soft sided roll aboard bag which is not normal and should maybe be questionable in today's environment.  We need to question more.  Had the TSA contacted someone in FLL it is pretty certain that the airline would have questioned the customer and perhaps avoided the incident.    There cannot be enough public outreach on many levels.  Perhaps print ads in newspapers and commercials on TV would help educate more people that don't want to read or listen to instructions at the airport.",No,OTHER,Packages or containers checked on board an aircraft by a passenger in addition to luggage,BAGGAGE,No,Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"American Airlines, Inc.",US,

Its route took the vehicle through Havre, MT, on Main Street. The lading on board consisted of four pallets of various goods, three of which held five, 30 gallon containers, one held case packaged goods. Also loaded on the truck were two 120 gallon totes, a single  110 gallon tote and a single 30 gallon drum. The materials were loaded as shown on the attached diagram. Load securement bars were deployed as shown by the attached diagram.  At approximately 0900, while traveling westward on Main Street, the vehicle operator applied brakes sharply. The sudden braking caused the loaded material to shift forward. From the post-accident scene, it is believed that on braking, the 120 gallon tote loaded in 4th position-right shifted against the adjacent load bar causing the bar to fail. The tote slid forward and collided with the pallet of Weedmaster and the pallet jack. The pallet of Weedmaster and the ratchet load bar were dislodged, shifted leftward, and overturned. One of the 30 gallon drums was found to have been damaged on its head and the majority of its contents released (picture attached.)  No other release occurred. The cased goods in the pallet in first position-left were compressed but did not release. Packaging failure appears to be the result of a collision within the truck body of a 30 gallon HDPE drum with a protruding object, possibly the corner of a pallet.","To prevent recurrence of incidents, drivers and warehouse personnel will review and refresh their knowledge of load securement. The FMCSA Driver’s Handbook on Cargo Securement will be reviewed.  Additional securement equipment will be purchased to supplement existing materials.  Driver’s will be re-trained on vehicle handling, including safe braking of vehicles and will be re-trained on the need for traffic situational awareness.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3830,HELENA CHEMICAL COMPANY,US,

The crew of this consist after being warned of the impending collision had stopped and secured the consist; then departed the area. The impact collision damaged and derailed both locomotives; and caused the trailing locomotive to derail into PLCX 220447 that was behind it.

A copy of the MSDS was requested. A-C-T contracted with SUNPRO Services (SUNPRO) to assess and conduct cleanup operations, as necessary.  A-C-T faxed a copy of the MSDS to SUNPRO.    Upon arrival at the site, the SUNPRO response team determined that there was an impacted area of 1-foot by 1-foot located in the middle of the trailer. The leak had occured from a puncture in the tp of the drum, but the response team was uable to determine the cause of the puncture. The drum was not leaking at the current time and granular sorbents had already been applied to the impacted area.  The response team overpacked the leaking drum into an 85-gallon overpack drum.  All sorbents were swept up into the overpack drum.  As per instructions from Arnold Transportation, the overpack drum was sealed and secured in the rear of the trailer for transportation to Arnold Transportation facility",,No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1549,"American Compliance Technologies, Inc.",US,

The baggage was offloaded and transported to the TSA screening area prior to Customers claiming their baggage and clearing U.S. Customs.  The TSA was using a CTX machine when Mr. Schmidt's bag ""alarmed"" in the machine.  The TSA opened the bag and discovered a 3-4 oz plastic bottle containing liquid Mercury.  Due to the lower pressure in flight, the Mercury had expanded and leaked out of the bottle between the threads in the cap and the bottle contaminating Mr. Schmidt's personal effects inside the bag.      At this point in time, the extent of the spilled Mercury was inside Mr. Schmidt's bag.  The bag was confiscated by the TSA and tendered to American Airlines for reporting to the FAA.  The FAA Great Lakes Regional Hazmat office was notified.    Mr. Schmidt was notified that the Mercury had been detected by the TSA, had spilled in his bag and that is was Hazmat.  Mr. Schmidt replied that he is a photographer and uses the Mercury in his photographic process.  Mr. Schmidt was advised that his bag and its contents could not be returned to him as it was now a Hazardous waste.    American Airlines had an Environmental cleanup company respond after some of the Mercury was spilled during FAA inspection.  The bag and the Mercury was then disposed of by the Hazardous Waste disposal company as per procedure.","Mercury is a special element in that it is liquid metal.  People may not realize its properties of expansion and contraction even though it is used in thermometers and barometers among other common things.    Special public outreach should be done to ensure more people understand that Mercury is poisonous, corrosive, has unusual properties depending upon its environment and is very harmful to humans and animals when allowed to leak out into the general environment.  Mercury is too easy for the general public to obtain and transport in ways that are not suitable.

Incident Date: 5/23/2007   Rollover accident occurred 12:49 p.m. (according to police incident report). First call received into our dispatch center at 12:55 p.m. Our unit was traveling WB on I-74 and exiting at exit 11 via a 1/4 mile exit ramp with the intention of turning left on Harrison Ave. Response of our driver was that he had just came off I-74 and was off throttle and stab breaking the unit as he traveled the exit ramp (#11) off I-74 toward Harrison Ave. Driver said he was stab breaking the unit until his speed was down to 35 mph and that he then went into 7th gear. Then as unit continued slowing and with more stab breaking to get the unit down to 25 mph — at which point he took unit out of gear — that as unit slowed he pressed accelerator slightly as unit reached 15 mph and he shifted into 5th gear and turned onto Harrison Ave. Driver stated he was getting down to what he perceived to me a safe speed for the turn and also have the unit in a gear that would enable him to start the climb up the hill as he started up Harrison Ave. Driver stated as he entered into the actual turn that it felt as if the rear of the unit was lifting off the ground and he felt as if it was pushing into the turn. As the unit was in process of the turn onto Harrison Ave. it rolled over onto passenger side, top and then onto the driver’ side of unit — coming to rest on the “corner” of the driver’s side and top of unit. A passing motorist had observed the accident and had called 911 and then assisted our driver get out of the unit by breaking out the windshield and assisting driver out. Driver attempted to shut off the truck engine prior to getting out of unit and it would not shut off and per driver the engine ran for a short while after he was extracted from the cab of the unit. Driver stated as the motorist assisted him out of truck he noticed that fuel was coming, at a pretty strong stream, out of the hole that had been ruptured into the top side of barrel near top rail and that as the engine of the truck was still running the motorist insisted and assisted him to a safe place away from the unit and spilling fuel. The motorist advised driver he had called 911 and our driver called our dispatch office on his cell and advised of the rollover and product spill situation.   Our unit is a five (5)-compartment tank wagon fuel delivery truck. During the rollover the driver’s side top portion of aluminum barrel of tank portion of unit was impacted against the roadway and curb area of roadway and a 4-5” gouged hole was evident in the tank as noted. 1,130 gallons, 96% of the 1,355 gallons of spilled product, came out of the “hole” in the #1 compartment.

The load included forklift batteries which contain about 50 gallons of acid and water solution.  The batteries were attached to wooden pallets with plastic strap banding.  At about 10 pm that night, the driver, Barry Guider, stopped for fuel at the Penske Truck Leasing facility in Chattanooga, TN.  He noticed a liquid dripping from the trailer doors and smelled battery acid.  The pallet holding the battery crushed, causing the support straps to become loose, which resulted in the battery tipping and knocking against something that cause the battery case to crack and about 2.5 gallons of sulfuric acid to leak out.  He contacted his dispatcher, who directed him to continue and complete his scheduled delivery.  He was about 50 miles away from the receiving facility.  Upon arrival, he notified the receiving facility of the spill, and was directed where to drop his trailer.  He was told they would neutralize the spill and clean it up.  The receiving facility cleaned and neutralized the trailer upon notification by the driver.","1) Implement additional job function training for the drivers to recognize potential hazardous material for transportation and then not to accept any hazardous material for transport. They will also be trained to understand their roles and responsibilities during a potential incident on the road which will include notifying the dispatcher and management to receive directions on proper spill response and clean up.  The dispatcher will receive training on steps needed to be taken to collect information from the driver and how to escalate the incident to management.    2) Shipper has been contacted and informed of the incident. Shipper informed us that they have developed procedures for shipping wet acid batteries, using more substantial pallets and strapping.    3) Implement additional training for drivers on identification of proper securing, locking and bracing of loads per 49 CFR 392.9.",No,BOX METAL,Metal box,BOX MTL,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Product Distribution Company,US,

The leak was communicated to the shipper and permission was granted to transfer the product into a different trailer. After the successful transfer of the product the trailer was washed and inspected. It was found to have a small crack in the barrel located at the hose tray support.

The individual did not let the driver know in time and as a result there was about 5 gallons of product that overflowed the top of the tank and spilled into a concrete contanment area.,The individual watching the tank level needed additional training and/or needed to watch more closely on future deliveries to prevent another incident similar to the one that occurred.

It had also oxidized the floor board and the cardboard copak box next to it. Afterdonning a repirator and tyvek I inspected the container and noticed that according to the Haz Waste label from the Generator that itwas a solution of 15% Nitric Acid, 8% Hydrochloric acid, remaining water. After examining the container it was determined to beRed Fuming Nitric Acid due to the positive oxidizer test, red staining of carboy, and fume generation when carboy was moved. TheGenerator (Roche Palo Alto LLC) was notified of having misidentified their waste and the manifest was adjusted and the carboy waspacked per DOT-SP-13192 and added to the manifest.

The unsecured manway bolts allowed the product surge to blow out a portion of the manway gasket, which sprayed the top of the tank car, and a portion of a second tank car, UTLX 66140, that was coupled into the tank.

Box 15459, Panama City, FL 32406-5459 and employed the company for remediation purposes. Their personnel arrived on site shortly afterwards and were entirely in charge of the cleanup activity. After completion of their work, personnel from the GA EPD and the site supervisor examined the area and deemed the cleanup to have been completed.    Saraguay Petroleum received an extensive report from SWS Environmental detailing their work and providing job site photos, logs, waste manifest, and test results of samples to confirm removal of the product. This report is readily available should any questions remain after your review of the following.    At this time, and at the notification of SWS, we consider the file closed and the spill area cleaned and remediated to like conditions prior to the event. We have contacted the owners of the site and they too concur.  Particular matters of interest as indicated in your correspondence are provided on the following page.    1. The spilled product leached down from the spill site, a 12,000 gallon above ground storage tank. A minimal amount of product leached in to a storm drain and traveled through the piping network and collected in a retention pond at the bottom of the road.  2. The total amount of product spilled was 600-70+/- gallons of dyed diesel fuel. Product which reached the pond was estimated to be 50+- gallons.  3. The spill occurred around 4 PM on 5/15/07, was contained by 8 PM, and the clean up concluded on 5/18/07. Backfill of the excavated site and removal of the absorbent boom from the retention pond were completed on 5/25/07. A project log maintained by SWS is provided as an enclosure.  4. The spill was caused by a “stupid American who should have known better” driver who did not follow company policy requiring his immediate presence at the site of the drop. Instead, after he began pumping off the product, he went to sit in the cab of his truck and did not notice that the hose had disconnected from the delivery point and product was spilling. Every action the driver took after starting the pump was in violation of written company policy. He was terminated that very evening.  5. The retention pond is not named—it is we believe a relatively new feature there in conjunction with the construction project.  a. The distance from the spill site to the pond was 200+/- feet.  b. There were no downstream receiving waters affected.  c. The first major body of water in the vicinity, unaffected by the spill is Hickory Log Creek.  6. A Site location map is provided as an enclosure.  7. A drawing of the site is provided as an enclosure.  8. A sketch of the spill site showing the extent of the spill is provided as an enclosure.  9. As mentioned earlier, we have numerous digital photos of the spill, before and after the cleanup, provided by SWS Environmental and archived on 4 CDs.

The doors of the trailer came open and the hazardous material came out of the door onto the ground.
