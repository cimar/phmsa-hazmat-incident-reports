NS then pulled the cars from the refinery and placed them at the Wilds Yard in Wood River.  At the time NS pulled the cars from Phillips 66 and placed them in the Wilds Yard they were not venting.  All four cars were spotted to the industry switch track and interchanged for pickup by Kansas City Southern Railroad (?KCS?) at 7:00 am CT on 5/27/21.  KCS did not arrive for pickup of the cars until 6/2/21. KCS hooked up to the cars in the afternoon of 6/2/21 and, in the process of releasing the brake system, discovered that GATX 231130 was venting.  KCS unhooked, pulled away, and the conductor requested medical assistance and was taken to a local hospital, but was not admitted.  The other three cars (TILX 101963, TILX101981 and TILX 101944) began venting on 6/3/21.  NS mobilized its hazardous materials incident response team to assist the Wood River Fire Department with emergency response on 6/2/21. Phillips 66?s fire department, Madison County Emergency Management/Madison County Hazmat, and the Wood River Police also responded. Remedial measures including water curtains and air scrubbing units were used to mitigate the release from 6/3/21 to 6/7/21.  On 6/7/21 and 6/8/21 responders replaced/repaired components of the pressure relief devices (?PRDs?) on the tank cars.  At 7:00 pm CT on 6/8/21 all four tank cars were moved back into the Phillips 66 refinery.  The tank cars began venting due to Phillips 66?s spent sulfuric acid undergoing a polymeric reaction, which created overpressurization that released through the PRDs on the four tank cars.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,Yes,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,974999,NORFOLK SOUTHERN,US,

Before sending to us, our Powder Engineer asked them to ensure the material was sent in accordance with all dangerous goods regulations. Huarui sent him a photo of what the (2) packages filled with powder looked like before sending. Both packages had a flammable label on them as well as a ""cargo aircraft only"" sticker. The box had a UN symbol on it and numbers next to it that were blurred out in the photo. Shipping labels were not able to be seen in the photo. When the packages arrived at Mott on July 1, DHL did not have the shipping papers for the material so it stayed in Shipping until they were able to receive it in. I (Crystal Steinfeld, EHS Manager for Mott) discovered on July 7 that the powder had been delivered and asked to see the packages. The flammable label and ""cargo aircraft only"" stickers were not on the packages and the UN symbol and numbers were covered up with tape. The only form of identification of the Titanium powder was found on the DHL label in extremely small writing: ""Contents - Titanium Hydride Powder"". One of the packages weighed 30 lbs in total (powder by itself 28.08lbs) and the second package weighed 28.68 lbs (powder by itself 26.72lbs). Each package contained three bags with smaller vacuum sealed bags of powder in each of those bags. There are a total of 8 vacuum sealed bags of powder. The packages are currently being quarantined.","There needs to be very clear communication between the carriers who have been hired to ship the hazardous material and the origin country (Hong Kong, China) in this case. We really need to understand China's laws for shipping hazardous materials because from what I am learning throughout this process, China does not allow hazardous material to leave their country. There is a disconnect from the material leaving the supplier facility and leaving Hong Kong via aircraft. The carriers need to closely follow and trace all materials they are signing up to ship out of China and specifically that airport because it seems as though someone covered up the hazardous information in order to get it out of China. Items need to be checked thoroughly before getting on an aircraft to avoid someone getting seriously harmed.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,MOTT CORPORATION,US,

The container was not leaking when the employee prepared to move it. Immediately after lifting the 55 gallon with a drum cart, the bottom of the container started to leak. There were four holes in the container on two opposing sides of the bottom of the drum. The holes were two by two and similar to a vampire bite. The Veolia employee investigated the source of the leak but could not figure out what caused the holes. We looked at the possibility of a defective drum cart but could not find anything. The drum was fairly old and rusty and the holes could have developed due to the age of the drum and/or the material within the drum causing deterioration, or the drum could have been defective.  About 1 liter of a waste flammable liquid leaked into the box van. No liquid made it outside of the box van. The drum was overpacked and the liquid on the truck floor was cleaned up.","There are several follow up items that were reviewed to try and prevent a recurrence. At first thought, we thought a drum cart may have caused the holes on the bottom of the container but we inspected the drum carts and did not find any defects that could have caused the holes. We also reviewed the contents of the drum and it is possible that material may have been put in the drum that corroded it from the inside and caused the leak. Also the drum could have been defective at the time of purchase. The drum did not start to leak until we moved it after a three hour trip. Veolia employees will continue to do inspections of containers, tools, and surfaces at time of shipment and at time of transfer to try and prevent similar leaks from happening.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Upon entering the warehouse the employee could smell a strong Chlorine smell and as he was waiting for the lights to come on he noticed something sitting in the middle of the warehouse floor. As the light got brighter he could see that it was a drum lid. The Veolia employee located the drum that the lid had come from.  It appears that it had pressurized over the weekend and blew the lid off. There was no physical damage to the building or any other drum.  Veolia is letting drum gas off more before putting on a new lid that is equipped with a vent to prevent it from building anymore pressure.    NOTE: The electronic 5800.1 form would not accept ""no release"" as a consequence of the incident.  There were no leaks from the drum and no hazardous materials spilled as a result of the incident.","In the future, all containers loaded with this material will be equipped with a vent to manage any pressure build up that may occur within the drum.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

MARTIN,TRANSPORTATION REGULATORY MANAGER,25800 SCIENCE PARK DR # 300,CLEVELAND,OH,44122-7386,Carrier,"On Friday July 2, 2021 at about 16:00, an Austin Powder Company driver was making a delivery of ammonium nitrate emulsion (UN3375) into a bin at the Austin location in Newnan, GA.  This involves pumping the product from the package (DOT 407 spec tank) into the bin.  Austin policy states that the driver attend the process in case of a malfunction and/or release of product.  The driver did not follow this procedure, and was away from the truck in an unknown location.  Driver reported that he was operating the PTO at normal rate.  However, the onsite manager and safety personnel suspect that the PTO was operating at higher than prescribed RPMs (to speed the process).  This is based on the fact that this driver had a similar incident a short time ago.  The driver called into his dispatcher, reporting a ""dinner plate sized"" amount of spilled material.  It was later found that the release was actually much larger than was initially reported.  A local cleanup crew was called and arrived at the scene on Monday morning, and they worked throughout the day, cleaning up the spilled product as well as impacted muddy soil.  All told, an estimated 2500-3000 lbs of material was cleaned up, removed from the site, and taken away for profiling and ultimate disposal.","The driver, who had a history of this type of event, was terminated.  The other drivers who make similar deliveries of this type of product (roughly 30 drivers) were all counseled in the wake of this event.  Specifically, remaining in attendance of vehicles offloading product, and operating PTO at normal RPMs was covered with them.  It is my belief that this event has brought the issue to adequate attention of the other drivers to prevent similar events in the future.  We have also looked at our rupture disks (currently getting from 2 different suppliers).  We do not see any correlation between which disks were in use when the events have occurred.

A 551a2 drum of waste paint fell over and started leaking out from around the lid ring. The team immediately got the drum upright and started cleaning the spill with spill pads.    When the Veolia employees attempted to retighten the drum ring but it continued to leak. This led the team to come to the conclusion that the customer used a lid without an o-ring to close the drum. The team opened the drum and verified that indeed there was no gasket in the lid. The customer brought out a new lid for the drum so that the original lid could be replaced. While the drum was open the customer inspected the contents and stated that about 1-2 gallons had escaped the drum. The paint did escape the box and spilled on to the fuel tank of the truck and the ground. Our team was able to place spill pad under the truck to collect most of the material before it hit the ground.    The customer took responsibility to clean material that had made it to the ground with spill dry and removal of contaminated gravel.,Veolia employees counseled the customer on the importance of using the right containers with all the appropriate pieces to ensure this doesn't occur again. The team also provided tips for identifying leaks around the the drum ring.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

(HCI) was traveling near the above-referenced location when a load shift occurred. As a result, one (1) 330-gallon tote containing ammonia solutions was punctured and released approximately 330 gallons of product to the trailer floor. Free product further migrated to the asphalt roadway and adjacent soil area. AIG Environmental Specialty Claims Consultants (AIG) retained Cura Emergency Services, LC (CES) to manage the remediation on behalf of HCI. CES dispatched a crew from Hull's Environmental Services (HES) to perform the necessary corrective action. HES removed all cargo from the trailer, deployed absorbents and neutralizing agent to the impacted surfaces, and relocated the damaged tote into a new trailer for transport back to HCI. All spent material was collected and containerized into three (3) 55-gallon drums for transport and disposal. HES then hand-dug a trench around the soil impact area and placed absorbent boom, scheduling to return at a later date for excavation operations to complete remedial actions.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,8000,CURA EMERGENCY SERVICES,US,

When the employee picked up the container it began to fume from the ring. The container fumed for roughly 10-20 minutes before it stopped. Trained Veolia employees were able to respond to the event in level B protective gear in order to overpack the container in a poly 95 gallon drum. Further investigation indicated that the material was a corrosive air reactive material that was placed in a steel drum for shipment. This material should have been packed into a poly container. It was also identified that the drum did not have a gasket which allowed material to come in contact with the air causing the material to fume. Once the container was overpacked Veolia did not have any further issues with the container. Veolia employees tightened the remaining 3 drums and safely shipped them with no further issues.",Veolia counseled the customer on the importance of using the proper containers with all the appropriate pieces to ensure this does not occur again.

Driver could not  avoid debris on the roadway from prior accident. After striking the debris the vehicle overturned resulting in a spill of approximately 6,100 gallons of gasoline. Shield Engineering managed the cleanup.   Shield dispatched Cliff-Berry, Inc. (CBI) to aid with recovery and cleanup. CBI noted a sheen on the  SW 60th St canal. Booms were placed in the roadside ditch and the outfall into the canal. CBI recovered  as much product as possible from the stormwater drains, concrete areas, and from the roadside ditch  itself.   Due to the quantity of gasoline released, as well as the impact to surface waters and the shutdown of  the highway, Shield notified the National Response Center (NRC) of the release within the first few hours  of the incident occurring (Incident Report #1312240). Shield also completed a Discharge Report Form  for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and provided a summary of the release and initial  response to the Miami-Dade County Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources.",This accident was non-preventable for our driver.

The package handlers immediately left the area and the spill was cleaned up properly with Hazardous Materials PPE. No one was harmed. The remaining gallons and package that contained the plastic gallon sized bottles were brought to the Hazmat area of the building. DescribePack: The package was very flimsy and seemed almost re-used. Inside the package the four 1 Gal. plastic bottles were loosley placed without any type of inner packing material to prevent the bottles from movement. The caps/lids of the plastic gallons were not secure. The small piece of tap on top of them did not stick well. There was too much space inside of the package. The bottle either hit the side of the box or one of the other gallons. As a result, the cap loosened on one of the four gallons and the corrosive machine detergent spilled out inside and ultimately - outside of the package.
