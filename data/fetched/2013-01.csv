No injuries reported and emergency responders were activated. At approximately 10:15 the emergency responders arrived onsite and were briefed on situation.     Upon further inspection of tank car UTLX950861, it was determined a very small leak had formed on the Pressure Relief Valve (PRV) underneath the protective housing. The odor was light and not detectable at ground level by responder but was slightly detectable at the top of the car with the protective housing cover open. The responder renewed the PRV o-ring, correcting the release. The internal pressure of the tank car was okay at 40 psi and all closures (valves and plugs) were found tool tight.

Emergency notifications were made and KCS responders were activated.     KCS responders arrived on-site, received situation briefing, and began root cause investigation on the first tank car, TELX90451. After a thorough inspection was performed including air monitoring, tool tightness and visual inspection of all tank car appurtenances, it was determined that tank car TELX90451 was not cause of odor. The KCS responders then proceeded to 2nd of 3 potential releasing tank cars. After thorough inspection of tank car TELX90455, including air monitoring, tool tightness and visual inspection of all tank car appurtenances, it was determined that tank car TELX90455 was not cause of odor. KCS responders proceeded to final tank car.    Upon further inspection of tank car TELX 539 by KCS responders, it was determined that the vapor line valve stem packing was loose and verified as the cause of trace vapor release. After information on tank car TELX 539 was disseminated, the car owner (Arkema) sent their own emergency responder to verify valve stem packing condition. Upon further inspection by shipper responder, it was determined that the vapor valve on tank car TELX 539 was one of the new valve types which are supposed to improve packing performance in changing temperatures. The packing was found at less than 20 inch pounds when the packing should have been tightened to 32 inch pounds to operate properly. The packing was properly tightened to the appropriate torque value thus correcting the release.     The Arkema responders double checked the other two tank car appurtenances for approriate tightness before departing from rail yard.    *No accidents of injuries were reported.

Driver proceeded to transport vehicle to an intermodal rail facility where the load in-gated and proceeded by train.

Immediate inspection by BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders revealed the odor source was at the manway closure of UTLX 650469. No liquid release was evident.  All eight manway securement bolts were found tool tight and the shipper seal numbered 112946 was intact at the manway closure. Inspection of the manway gasket condition found the gasket torn and deteriorated, thus not providing a good closure seal. A new manway gasket was installed and the manway lid was resecured, which ended any further escape of commodity vapors/odor. Seal BNSF 06157776 was applied at the manway closure.

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders inspected the railcars at the repair track and determined tank car UTLX 672867 was the odor source. Previous hardened sulfur spillage was noted around the manway nozzle but no free flowing liquid was observed. The responders reported finding 4 of 8 manway securement swing bolt nuts less that tool tight. The manway gasket was inspected and found to be serviceable, thus the loose manway securement nuts prevented a good closure seal and allowed commodity odor/vapors to escape. The manway lid was closed and all manway securement swing bolt nuts were properly tool tightened.

The tank car was isolated. The shipper, Praxair Inc., was notified via Chemtrec, report #2013-0117-00252 . The shipper representative, John Gulotta, 630-450-0308 was notified of the situation and responded a technician to meet our Terminal employees and attempt repairs. At 0240 the on site technician determined he was unable to secure the release of vapors which was determined to be from the bonnet nut on the three inch liquid line. Praxair sent two additional technicians in an effort to attempt repairs and tighten the bonnet nut with a specialized wrench. CSXT dispatched SPSI, a CSXT emergency response contractor, to the Willard Terminal in an effort to assist if needed and ensure safety to employees in the Terminal. The vapor release was secured by tightening the bonnet nut thus stopping the vapor release and LTCX 1902 was released for disposition.   This incident did require a special move.

Appropriate notificaitons were made and emergency responders were activated. The car was isolated in zone 2 on track 806 in the Beaumont Yard.    Upon arrival, the emergency responder noted no odor was detected nor unsafe air monitoring readings. Upon further inspection of the tank car, the responder noted a ""very very small leak"" was coming from the pressure relief device (PRD) and ""did not present a hazardous situation."" The first emergency responder did not have necessary equipment required to make the appropriate repairs to the PRD so a second responder was activated.     Once the second emergency responder arrived, they replaced 2 O-rings in the PRD and the leak was stopped. Both O-rings were deformed in a flattened fashion. The car only had 10 psi pressure however the defective O-rings, coupled with the unusually cold temperatures, caused the PRD to seep very slightly. The responders secured the tank car and then performed a safety brief everyone at the yard office before departing the property.    *No injuried were reported    File Note Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities,   and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable.    For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence   of unsafe transportation conditions.    The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs.

ON MONDAY 1/7, WHILE VISITING OUR NEIGHBOR, RICH METALS, WE REALIZED THAT 14,100 GALLONS OF ALCOHOL FLOWED ONTO THEIR (RICH METALS) PROPERTY. THIS WAS AN ACT OF VANDALISM AS THESE TRAILERS WERE SEALED WITH TAMPER EVIDENT CABLE SEALS. FOUR SEALS WERE CUT TO GAIN ENTRY TO THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL VALVES, ALLOWING THE PRODUCT TO FLOW FROM THE TRAILER. THE CUT SEALS WERE FOUND LYING ON THE GROUND.

ROBERTS,"DIRECTOR, ENVIRONMENTAL & REGULATORY COMP.","# 6 DESTA DRIVE, SUITE 6600",MIDLAND,TX,79705,Carrier,"Loving County - The driver of a semitrailer truck escaped serious injury early this New Year's Day (01JAN2013)morning after his truck hit several cattle on FM 652 about fifteen miles east of Orla, TX.  Edward H. Birdwell was traveling southwest on FM652 early New Year's Day when his truck struck several cows which had wandered onto the roadway.  After the impact, Birdwell's truck spun into the south shoulder and flipped over, said the Department of Public Safety officers that investigated the crash.  Birdwell is an employee of Plains Marketing, L. P. working out of their Hobbs, NM Truck District.  Birdwell was taken to the Reeves County Hospital by Pecos Ambulance Service.  He was examined and evaluated there and subsequently transported by helicopter to University Medical Center in El Paso, TX.  The cattle did not survive the impact. Five adult cows and two calves were killed.  Authorities speculate the cows escaped through a gap in a fence and poorly maintained cattle guards.  The semitrailer and its crude oil payload were a total loss.  The owner of the cows and adjacent landowners were contacted. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) removed the dead animals.  The cargo tank rupture allowed crude oil to leak onto an area of pasture south of the FM652 Right-of-Way where the semitrailer came to rest. Plains' Hobbs Emergency Response Team contained the spill using containment booms, absorbents, and soil. Duration of the spill was approximately one hour. The cargo tank rupture was a circular breach in the lower driver side quadrant of the tank shell, approximately 10' rearward of the front bulkhead; approximately 3"" in diameter.","Plains Marketing, L. P. intends to increase driver training on situational awareness and increased attention to potential hazards of driving in darkness, and the special hazards night driving presents.  Additionally, Plains Marketing, L. P. will include orientation and training for its drivers on the Texas Open Range laws, with specific emphasis on the counties in which Plains operates. Loving County is ""Open Range"" and this incident will be used as a case study to illustrate the additional dangers that drivers in Open Range locations may encounter.    Plains will also consider ""Deer Whistles"", devices mounted on the fronts of cars, trucks, and motorcycles, which allegedly produce ultrasonic frequencies and/or audible sounds from the wind rushing through them. These sounds are supposed to repel or warn animals, particularly deer, elk, moose,dogs, and cattle of oncoming vehicles.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,195600,PLAINS ALL AMERICAN,US,

All eight tires on the rear of the tanker were destroyed in the fire.  Moreover, the fire and heat did extensive damage to the outer shell of the Fiberglass tanker that was reinforced with balsa wood.  The hose trays and transfer hoses were also burned up in the fire.  Consequently, the gasket inside the bottom belly valve assembly on the tanker failed because of the fire damage and allowed Hydrochloric Acid (32%) to start dripping out at the rear of tanker.    Based on our interviews with our two drivers on board and our inspection of the tanker after it was returned and dismantled in our fleet maintenance shop by our lead mechanic, it led us to suspect that we must have had a tire failure that started with the back right inside tire and then possibly caused the brake system to start dragging due to a gradual release of air pressure on our brake system.  After the tire caught fire, the situation continued to escalate until only the remnants of the steel cords and melted rubber remained on the rims.  Therefore, we could not confirm for sure what may have caused the tire failure.  Our drivers did not detect any tire problems when a pre-trip inspection was conducted.    Sequence of events leading up to the incident:    Our driver, Chris Reynolds, logged on duty at 0409 and proceeded to couple to Tanker 24957 loaded with Muriatic Acid (Hydrochloric Acid 32%).  Mack Tinsley, designated trainer and passenger, was assigned to ride with Chris on this delivery.  They conducted their Pre-Trip Inspection and did not detect any problems.  However, Chris explained that as he proceeded to make a turn, the trailer brakes suddenly locked up.  We had experienced a sudden drop in the ambient temperature overnight and it was below the freezing mark.  We suspected the issue was related to ice crystals in the air line due to moisture in the system.  Chris uncoupled from the tanker and contacted our Fleet Maintenance mechanic on duty.  The mechanic used our spot truck and added some airline drying fluid and got the trailer into our wash bay that is equipped with hot air drying equipment.  Our mechanic applied hot air to the back of the trailer and treated with the airline drying fluid to ensure the brakes were releasing properly.  After the tanker was released, Chris coupled to the tanker and then proceeded to our Guard House Scale without incident.  At approximately 5:30 a.m., they left the Henderson Facility and proceeded to the Pennyrile Parkway en route to Calvert City.    After traveling approximately 20 miles Southbound on the Pennyrile, they approached mile marker 54 (Calhoun exit) and noticed the truck was pulling hard while going up a hill.  After topping the hill, the truck was still pulling hard.  M","Based on the sequence of events, we discussed the fact that when a combination unit appears to be pulling hard or losing power, we should not assume that it may be only engine related.  It may indeed be related to damaged tires and brake issues.  Therefore, if we are losing power, we should stop sooner and inspect the tires and brake system for any signs of damage or heat or anything else out of the ordinary.    During our investigation, we discussed possible causes such as the brakes out of adjustment, ice crystals in the airline due to moisture build up, brake hose failure, or brake valve failure.  Since the trailer tires never locked up we suspect a contributing factor related to something that created a gradual release of air pressure to the brake system that allowed the brakes to drag and not lock up.  It was very evident the right inside rear frame of the tanker showed signs of exposure to the greatest amount of heat.    This incident will be reviewed in our drivers safety meeting as a moment of high influence to ensure our operating procedures remain current and accurate and recurrent training requirements are conducted to support our hazmat training for general awareness, function specific, safety, and general security awareness and indepth security training of our site security plan for personnel security, physical security, and en route security.     Moreover, we will follow up with our emergency response team members to conduct a post-critique of our strengths and opportunities for improvement.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,120218,"Brenntag Mid-South, Inc.",US,

Inspection by a BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder and contract responders revealed the leak source was at the 165 psi pressure relief device (PRD). The commodity outage observed within UTLX 211343 was deemed appropriate, thus concluding that the PRD had failed. UTLX 211343 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard. Spillage on UTLX 211343 was cleaned. No further commodity release was observed as UTLX 211343 remained motionless. A like model replacement PRD was ordered, received and then installed on 2/05/2013 without further incident. The failed PRD incurred a broken stem at its bottom threaded area above the spring follower and retainer/locking nut area. The PRD spring and associated hardware could not be retrieved from inside UTLX 211343.

He stated that he was finished loading around 0030hrs then took a nap until 0245hrs. Troy mentioned that the conditions at the location (Antelope 3-5) where  cold and foggy. He stated that he left the location making a right turn and felt a small bump. Troy then  continued on the Jonah  Midcrest  Road approx. 1.5 miles until he approached highway  191 until he noticed  that his brakes  were locked  up on his pup trailer (1979  Polar Vin 4072). He stated that he then exited his truck and noticed that the pup was leaking natural gas condensate from a breach in the tank hull. He then contacted  Linn Energy  controller (Tyler) and notifed him of the accident. Troy also alleged  that he contacted another unkown Linn employee who told him that due to the time, date (holiday), and the fact that the spill would be reportable anyway  it would  be hard to find anyone to help. Troy stated that he waited  ""hours""  for help but no one came to help and due to the ""cold"" he was unable to stay, so he unhooked the pup and left the scene  returning  to the shop in Lyman, Wy. It should be noted that Mr. Mitchel never did report this incident  to law enforcement or Feehan Trucking  as per Feehan Trucking policy.  At approx. 0430hrs Linn Energy contacted Ray Orana and I and notified  us of the incident. We arrived at the Jonah Midcrest Road at approx.  OBOOhrs and observed the afor mentioned  pup which was now off loaded by Partners  Trucking. I did observe that the pup had a tear along the right side approx. 5 ft long, under which the seam  of the tank had been seperated. We then responded to the Linn Enegry  Antelope 3-5 and observed where tracts left in the snow by Mitchel. He arrived on the location and loaded on the passenger side facing the oppisite  direction  than he had been trained. It should  be noted that Mitchel had another 15 to 20 feet of unused  area to perform a turn. Following the tire tracks the pup ran completely over a 4"" steel pipe used  as a corner  post for the location berm  fence. The tire track continued out of the site after which the brakes  locked up due to the manifold and brake control valve being torn from the pup. The release of condensate was determined to be from 0300hrs until 0530hrs. It should  be noted that Mitchel's  statements were inconsistant and contradicted by Linn Energy  employees' statements.","Feehan Trucking has implemented a remedial training concerning our safety and company  policies. We are also creating  an incident report protocol and call list with step by step instructions. Additionally, we will continue to review policies  and further safety programs to ensure  that Feehan Trucking is as safe as possible. A suggestion that I would  extend is that the Shipping Company (Linn Energy) would have emergency containment equipment (sand bags, containment tubs, oil cloths, eel.) on site in a location where  the Controllers would have access  to them  in case of such incidents. It should also be known  that Troy Mitchel was terminated from his position due to negligence and failure to perform manditory  duties outlined  in Feehan Trucking  Company Policies.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,13172,FEEHAN TRUCKING,US,

It appeared that batteries within one of the pallets located nears center of trailer had short circuited and caused the batteries to overheat and packaging material to ignite. The amount of release is estimated. The cleanup done by contractor was mostly water used by fire department to extinguish the over heated batteries.    The incident occurred less than a mile form the shipper. The batteries were returned to the shipper,The Shipper was to do further investigation into the cause of the batteries within the pallet that short circuited upon their return. The cause of the short circuit is unknown by us,No,DRUM NON-METAL,"Plastic pail, open head, capacity 10 gallons or less",PAIL PLS,No,,,,,,,800,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3000,Wiley Sanders Truck Lines,US,

BNSF mechanical /hazardous material responders investigating the odor source reported finding residue tank car GATX 3019 that previously arrived on an inbound BNSF train was the most likely source of the reported odor. Further inspection of GATX 3019 revealed vapor/odor emanating from the manway closure. The manway securement bolts were tight. The installed manway gasket was found cracked around its entire circumference at mid-width which contributed to the manway gasket not sealing properly. A new manway gasket was installed and the manway closure was properly resecured. Intact shipper seal B-102830 removed at the manway was replaced by seal BNSF 06157483. All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure. Seal BNSF 06157482 was applied at the valve housing cover. No liquid commodity was released from GATX 3019. After securement was completed at 1355 hrs. PST, 1/31/2013, the odor around GATX 3019 dissipated.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The PRD specification stampings indicated that it was manufactured in 2012 and per UTC it was installed on UTLX 209876 in June, 2012. No ground impact from spillage was observed and the spillage on UTLX 209876 was evaporating. UTLX 209876 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard awaiting lading transfer and application of a replacement PRD. No commodity release was observed while UTLX 209876 remained motionless. Commodity within UTLX 209876 was transferred into tank trucks without further incident on 2/15/2013.

After the KM Operator removed the seals and belly cap, product flowed freely as the valve holding the product was in the full open position (the handle however, indicated that it was closed). The KM Operator immediately notified management, and the Operations Supervisor was able to stem the flow of product by manipulating the handle back into the closed position after approximately 4 minutes of free flow. There were no injuries, and no product impacted the soil. As precautionary measures the surface of the loading rack was washed down with water to flush any residual product into containment. Covers were additionally placed on top of the containment sump to suppress potential flammable vapors. LEL monitors were used to determined the boundaries of the associated vapor hazard- the meters gave negative readings unless directly over the product. Calls were made to the local FD and Hazmat services to alert them of the situation and also ready their assets in the event the situation worsened. After the incident, UTLX was brought to the terminal to inspect the bottom outlet valve handle. It was learned that the pin connecting the handle and stem was missing (pin ensures that the handle is seated properly/secure).","Kinder Morgan is currently testing various railcar emergency plugging devices to determine best management practices for stopping uncontrolled releases at the belly-valve.

After he left the fuel stop and was turning right to enter the freeway he saw in his mirror that a liquid trail was following him. He pulled over on the gravel shoulder of the entrance ramp to investigate. There was product spilling from the trailer from under the skin of the chemical trailer and he thought we had a tank failure andimmediately called his manager. The safety manager was immediatly called and Haz-MatOne (a Hazardous Material Responder) was called for immediate dispatch to the scene to get the product cleaned up. The trailer stopped leaking. We dispatched another unit to the scene to transfer the load onto a different trailer. During the transfer the drivers removed the seals to the manholes (front and back) which has the wash out caps in them to vent the trailer. The tank wash does the tank cleaning and seals the trailer. It was discovered that the employees at the tank-wash failed to place the caps on the wash out pipes in which released the product during transportation because of the surge and sloshing of the material in the trailer which resulted in the release of product spilling to the ground. The duration of the release was from the customer pick up site to the driver noticing the release and only when the product was surging and sloshing when starting or stopping.,"We have made contact to the shipper that the procedure to have the tank wash seal and secure the caps after tank is washed and not having anyone double-check that thecaps are replaced and tight is not an exceptable practice. From this day forward the tank wash will do what they have always done. The customer agrees and they will break the seals when the trailer is loaded and make sure the caps are in place and tight. They will then reseal the trailer with their company seals. Our loading sheet for our drivers will have a ""Hot Topic"" documented on the load sheet.""Verify that all seals are the customers seals or do not leave the customer until thecustomer breaks the seals, inspects the washout caps of being on and tight and resealed.""",No,,Cargo tanks,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7555,LIQUID TRANSPORT CORP,US,

THE RESIN WAS LOADED INTO THE CTMV BELOW THE REQUIRED DELIVERY TEMPERATURE. OUR DRIVER STOPPED AT A SERVICE FACILITY AND THE CTMV WAS STEAM HEATED UNTIL THE RESIN WAS 170 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT, WHICH IS WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE DELIVERY RANGE. ACETONE BOILS AT ABOUT 133 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT, CONSEQUENTLY, HEATING THE RESIN IN THE CLOSED CTMV PRESSURIZED THE CTMV. AT 170 DEGREE FAHRENHEIT, ACETONE'S VAPOR PRESSURE IS ABOUT 13.5 PSIG.

IT IS ALSO BEING REPORTED BECAUSE OF THE CLEAN UP EFFORT REPORTED BY THE CONSIGNEE.","Opening a package containing a material above its initial boiling point will cause the material to suddenly boil (flash evaporation).

The load consisted of approximately 167 barrels of crude oil. While in route to the delivery point, the driver proceeded northbound on US Hwy 59 Business.  At the intersection of US Hwy 59 Business and US Hwy 59, the driver attempted to turn westbound onto US 59 toward the on-ramp. Due to an unsafe speed, the transport vehicle overturned onto its right side.  The transport came to rest lying partially on the roadway and the right shoulder of the roadway. No product was released from the cargo tank due to the crash. Emergency Services were summoned to the scene as well as company personnel. THe driver was taken to De Tar Hospital via Victoria EMS for evaluation.  The driver was later treated and released with only minor injuries.  Another company transport was brought to the scene to transfer the load.  After the transfer was complete, wrecker services uprighted the transport and towed it off site.  No further action was required.","The root cause of this lay-over accident was due to an unsafe speed while making a turn. Contributing factors include load surge due to a partial load on a transport with high center of gravity. The vehicle's estimated speed just before the lay-over was 25 mph.      Additional awareness training on the factors that caused and contributed to this event is warranted. Drivers have particiated in an accident review process to include discussion on the hazards of unsafe speed, load surge, and high center of gravity.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,104800,"BKEP Crude, LLC",US,

Our transport vehicle identified as unit 309 had left the roadway on the left side, struck a guardrail and flipped over in the median. We immediately responded by contacting an environmental contractor and a towing contractor as well as an adjuster to meet us on scene. We immediately began communications with the State HP to relay our plans to remediate the accident scene. WE arrived on scene at approx 3:30pm. Haz Mat had control of the scene until we were able to remove the product from the tank. At that time, the truck was rolled back over and removed from the scene.  Under the circumstances of the accident, the situation was the best possible scenario. When the truck flipped over and slid to a stop, it pushed an earthen dam up in front of the tractor, which stopped any free product from flowing directly into the storm drain. The estimated rate of leakage was slow enough that the ground soaked up the product before it could flow into the storm drain.

The driver parked in the unloading area at the facility and proceeded to connect all of the compartments via hose to the suction header on the unloading pump at the facility. Another person prepared the rail car for loading. They opened the top dome to verify that it was empty. Then they took off the cap on the bottom loading valve on the rail car. The procedure then has them open the valve and close it again, leaving the cap off. The problem with this load was that the bottom valve on the rail car came in and it was open. When the person thought they were opening the valve, they actually closed it. Then when they thought they were closing it, they were actually opening it. At this point, the transfer pump was turned on and the filling of the rail car started. The person that was at the rail car noticed the red diesel flowing below and shut down the pump. He then closed the outlet valve. This pump operates at about 1000 gallons per minute and about 1300 gallons exited the car before the valve was closed. The released product made its way to the evaporation pond via an oil water separator. The oil water separator was not designed for this heavy of loading and passed the diesel directly to the pond. We had extreme rain conditions this particular evening and had concerns of the evaporation pond getting too full. We called in a vacuum truck to prevent the diesel from spreading further. None of the release left the property.","The rail car loading procedure has been revised so that the bottom valve is physically checked by putting your and up the 4"" opening to verify that the operation of the valve is closed before filling the rail car.",Yes,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,404000,,,
