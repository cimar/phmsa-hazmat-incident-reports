THE MATERIAL WAS PILED ONTO AN UNPAVED SLAG ROAD THAT HAS BEEN TREATED REPEATEDLY WITH AN ASPHALT RESIN DUST SUPPRESSANT.  THE SURFACE OF THE ROAD WHERE THE SPILL OCCURRED IS VERY HARD DUE TO YEARS OF DUST SUPPRESSANT BEING APPLIED. HYDRO TECHNOLOGY COMPLETED THE CLEAN UP AT APPROXIMATELY 3:50 P.M.  THE NRC WAS CONTACTED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 A.M., THE MDEQ-PEAS WAS CONTACTED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:21 A.M., AND THE LEPC WAS CONTACTED AT 10:31 A.M.  AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 A.M. MACSTEEL MONROE, INC.

ALSO, I EXPLAINED THAT THE MATERIAL WAS SPILLED ONTO A HARD SURFACE AND THAT THE BAGHOUSE DUST HAS A DISTINCTIVE RED/RUST COLOR WHICH MADE IT EASY TO DISTINGUISH FROM THE BACKGROUND COLOR OF THE ROAD.  MR. YOCUM THEN REQUESTED THAT SWAB SAMPLES BE TAKEN FROM THE AREA TO VERIFY THAT THE MATERIAL WAS ADEQUATELY REMEDIATED.  THREE BACKGROUND SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM OTHER AREAS OF THE SAME ROADWAY THAT WAS NOT AFFECTED BY THE RELEASE, AND ONE SAMPLE WAS TAKEN FROM THE CLEANED AREA.  SWAB SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 P.M.  THESE SAMPLES WERE SUBMITTED TO MIDWEST ANALYTICAL SERVICES, INC. AT APPROXIMATELY 8:30 A.M. ON 2/24/04. MACSTEEL MONROE, INC. RECEIVED THE SAMPLE RESULTS ON 2/25/04.  THE ANALYTICAL RESULTS ARE ATTACHED.  MR YOCUM ALSO REQUESTED THAT PHOTOGRAPHS BE TAKEN BEFORE AND AFTER THE CLEAN UP WHICH ARE ALSO ATTACHED.

ADDITIONALLY AN ODOR, SIMILAR TO ROTTEN EGGS, WAS DETECTED BY THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE.  A GAS CYLINDER EMERGENCY RESPONSE SPECIALIST (SPECIALIST) WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SITE TO INSPECT THE PACKAGE.  WHILE THE SPECIALIST WAS IN ROUTE TO THE SITE THE DRIVER RE-INSPECTED THE PACKAGE AND FOUND THE SWELLING OF THE OUTER PACKAGE HAD SUBSIDED AND THE ODOR DETECTED EARLIER BY THE DRIVER WAS NO LONGER PRESENT. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 ON FEBRUARY 04, 2004 THE SPECIALIST ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND OPENED THE OUTER PACKAGE.  THE OUTER PACKAGE CONTAINED ONE CYLINDER OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE, ONE CYLINDER OF CARBON MONOXIDE AND ONE CYLINDER OF ETHYLENE OXIDE.  IT WAS NOTED THAT THE OUTER PACKAGE DID NOT CONTAIN ANY PACKING MATERIAL TO SECURE OR CUSHION THE CYLINDERS.  UTILIZING A PORTABLE HYDROGEN SULFIDE DETECTOR, THE SPECIALIST DETECTED HYDROGEN SULFIDE VAPOR WITHIN THE OPENED PAIL AND NEAR THE HYDROGEN SULFIDE CYLINDER VALVE.  THE HYDROGEN SULFIDE CYLINDER AND CYLINDER VALVE WERE DETERMINED TO BE IN EXCELLENT PHYSICAL CONDITION BY THE SPECIALIST.  THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF CORROSION, DENTS, PITTING OR OTHER DEFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CYLINDER OR VALVE.  THE THREADED VALVE OUTLET PLUG (WITH WASHER) WAS IN PLACE.  THE SPECIALIST CHECKED THE HYDROGEN SULFIDE CYLINDER VALVE AND FOUND THAT IT WAS NOT SECURELY TIGHTENED.  THE CYLINDER VALVE WAS IMMEDIATELY TIGHTENED BY THE SPECIALIST.  THE SPECIALIST ALSO CHECKED THE VALVE OUTLET PLUG WHICH WAS FOUND TO BE LOOSELY THREADED INTO THE VALVE OUTLET.  THE SPECIALIST SECURELY TIGHTENED THE OUTLET PLUG.  THE CYLINDER WAS SECURED WITHIN AN OVERPACK, THE OVERPACK PROPERLY MARKED AND LABELED AND ALL ON-SITE ACTIVITIES COMPLETED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:00 ON FEBRUARY 04, 2004.  THE CYLINDER WAS DELIVERED TO SET ENVIRONMENTAL, THE DESIGNATED CONSIGNEE ON FEBRUARY 9, 2004.  THE CAUSE OF THE VAPOR RELEASE WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE RESULT OF THE CYLINDER VALVE OPENING SLIGHTLY DURING SHIPMENT WHICH IN TURN CAUSED THE SWELLING OF THE OUTER PACKAGE.  SINCE THE OUTER PACKAGE WAS LACKING A PACKING MATERIAL TO CUSHION THE CYLINDERS, IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE CYLINDERS WERE ABLE TO MOVE FREELY WITHIN THE OUTER PACKAGES WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE VALVE OPENING DURING SHIPMENT.  ADDITIONALLY, ALTHOUGH A VALVE OUTLET PLUG WAS THREADED INTO THE VALVE OUTLET, IT WAS NOT SECURELY TIGHTENED.  PROPERLY SECURING THE OUTLET PLUG BY THE SHIPPER MAY HAVE PREVENTED THE VAPOR RELEASE.  RECOMMENDATIONS TO AVOID FUTURE INCIDENTS INCLUDE: 1. ENSURE THAT CYLINDER VALVES ARE SECURELY TIGHTENED PRIOR TO SHIPPING.  2. ENSURE THAT CYLINDER OUTLET PLUGS (WITH WASHER) ARE IN PLACE AND SECURELY TIGHTENED PRIOR TO SHIPPING AND, 3.

TOM WAS PARKED IN THE DOCK AT THE 3M COMPANY, PRAIRE DU CHIEN, WI WHEN HE FIRST DISCOVERED THE SPILL.  THE SHIPMENT CONSISTED OF 11 BULK BAGS (1107 LBS EACH) OF A SOLID POISON MATERIAL, DIAMINODIPHENYLMETHANE.  THE SHIPMENT WAS TO BE DELIVERED TO 3M COMPANY WHEN THE LEAKAGE WAS DISCOVERED BY MR. HEINEMAN.  THE 11 PALLETS IN THIS SHIPMENT EACH HELD ONE BULK BAG.  THIS SHIPMENT WAS LOADED IN TO THIS TRAILER IN THE EARLY A.M. HOURS BY A DOCK EMPLOYEE AT N&M TRANSFER CO.  NO SPILL INCIDENT OF ANY KIND WAS REPORTED BY THE DOCK EMPLOYEE LOADING THE TRAILER, NOR WAS THERE ANY SPILL REPORT ISSUED BY THE FOREMAN OR SUPERVISOR WHO SUPERVISED THE LOADING.  PLEASE SEE ATTACHED PHOTOS.  THE RUPTURED PALLET IS LOADED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRAILER.  IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE RUPTURED BAG IS EITHER THE FIRST OR SECOND PALLET LOADED (TOWARDS THE NOSE) ON THE LEFT SIDE.  THE AMOUNT OF RUPTURED MATERIAL TRAVELED BACKWARDS TOWARD THE TRAILER DOOR, COVERING THE FLOOR AREA UNDERNEATH THE PALLETS LOADED BEHIND THE RUPTURED SKID.  THE SPILLED MATERIALS WERE IMMEDIATELY CLEANED UP BY THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE TEAM FROM THE 3M COMPANY.  INITIAL CLEAN UP WAS USE OF A WET VAC.  A WATER TREATMENT OF SOME FORM WAS THEN USED TO REMOVE THE REMAINING RESIDUE OFF OF THE TRAILER FLOOR.  AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT THIS CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE OF THIS MATERIAL IS UNKNOWN.  MR. ROBERT JONES (OWNERS OF BALL WAREHOUSE, THE SHIPPER) ADVISED ME BY PHONE CALL ON FRIDAY 2/20 THAT AT HIS FACILITY THESE BULK BAGS ARE REMOVED FROM THE ""CHINESE"" PALLETS THAT THEY ARRIVED ON AND ARE THEN PLACED ON A STURDIER 4 X 4 PALLET.  A SLIP SHEET IS FIRST PLACED UNDER THE BAG ON TOP OF PALLET.  AFTER THE BAGS ARE PLACED SQUARELY ON A PALLET THEY ARE SHRINK WRAPPED TO THE PALLET.  ELLEN SCHIEBER, SAFETY ENGINEER AT 3M COMPANY, ALSO ADVISED ME ON FRIDAY 2/20 THAT THERE WAS A PUNCTURE IN THE BAG APPROXIMATELY 6"" WIDE.  THE AREA OF THE PUNCTURE WAS DIRECTLY UNDER THE BAG.  IT WAS NOT NEAR ANY OF THE BOTTOM EXTERIOR AREA OF THE BAG.  THE SIZE OF THIS PUNCTURE WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE WIDTH OF A FORK ON A TOWMOTOR.  STRANGELY ENOUGH, ELLEN ALSO NOTED THAT NEITHER THE SLIP SHEET BELOW THE BAG, OR ANY OF THE BOARDS FROM THE PALLET, WERE DAMAGED IN ANY WAY.  OUR ONLY CONCLUSION WAS THEN THE BAG WAS PUNCTURED ONLY AFTER IT HAD BEEN MOVED FROM IT'S ORIGINAL ""CHINESE"" PALLET.  THE 20 LBS OF SPILLED POISON SOLID REMAINED CONFINED TO AN AREA TOTALLY WITHIN THE TRAILER.  THAT AREA OF THE TRAILER FLOOR IS APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET BY 6 FEET.  THE APPROXIMATE 20 LBS OF SPILLED MATERIAL WAS ADDED (FOR PROPER DISPOSAL) TO THE HAZARDOUS WASTE STREAM AT 3M COMPANY.  DURING THE 2-3 HOURS OF CLEAN UP OF THIS MATERIAL, NO INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OF ANY KIND WAS REPORTED.

AFTER VERIFYING LARRY'S IDENTIFICATION, HE MOVED OUR TRUCK INSIDE THE GATE AND ALONGSIDE THE GUARD SHACK FOR INSPECTION.  THIS IS A NEW PROCEDURE SINCE THE EVENTS OF 9-11, THE GATE AND GUARD SHACK ARE APPROXIMATELY 7 MILES FROM THE PLANT DOWN AN ACCESS ROAD. THERE IS A FULL TIME CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER STATIONED AT THE GATE.  ONCE OUR TRUCK WAS INSIDE THE GATE, THE GUARDS OPENED THE REAR DOOR OF THE TRAILER, TO VERIFY THE CARGO, AND NOTICED A SMALL AMOUNT OF LIQUID (APPROX.. 2 PINTS) ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER AND ON THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TWO TOTES OF HYDRAZINE.  IT APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN COMING FROM THE TOP CLOSURE DURING TRANSPORTATION.  PG&E'S SECURITY NOTIFIED THE CHP OFFICER WHO IN TURN, CALLED THE SAN LUIS OBISPO FIRE DEPT.  LARRY THEN CONTACTED HIS SUPERVISOR, ARTHUR DUIM, WHO IN TURN NOTIFIED ME OF THE INCIDENT AT APPROX. 12:40 P.M.  AFTER SPEAKING WITH LARRY MYSELF I CONTACTED OUR REGULATORY MANAGER, MICHAEL NASSRALLA, AND DISTRICT MANAGER, GEORGE MARTIN. I THEN CONTACTED PG&E TO SEE IF THEY COULD DEAL WITH THE SITUATION.  I SPOKE WITH STEVE REED AT PG & E AND HE TOLD ME THEY HAD AN ON-SITE FIRE DEPT. THAT HAS HANDLED THESE SITUATIONS BEFORE AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE THEM CHECK THE SITUATION OUT.

SAN LUIS OBISPO'S HAZ-MAT TEAM HANDLED THE INCIDENT BY TIGHTENING DOWN THE BOLT RING ON THE TOP OF THE TOTE, PRIOR TO US TRANSPORTING IT BACK TO OXNARD.  I CONTACTED OUR REGULATORY MANAGER, MICHAEL NASSRALLA, AND, DISTRICT MANAGER, GEORGE MARTIN.  MICHAEL LEFT A MESSAGE FOR DWIGHT LANDRY FOR GUIDANCE ON THE SECOND REPORTING OF THE SAME INCIDENT.  IT WAS DECIDED THAT THIS WAS A SEPARATE INCIDENT AND MICHAEL MADE THE NECESSARY NOTIFICATIONS/REPORTS.  I CONTACTED ECOLOGY CONTROL INC. (ECI) AND SPOKE WITH TERRY SULLIVAN.  I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION TO HER AND SHE SENT A RESPONSE TEAM TO THE LA/GARFIELD FACILITY TO PICK UP A NEW GASKET FOR THE TOTE AND THEN PROCEED TO THE OXNARD FACILITY TO HANDLE THE INCIDENT.  AFTER DISCUSSING THE INCIDENT FURTHER WITH GEORGE MARTIN, IT WAS DECIDED THAT I WOULD GO TO THE OXNARD FACILITY TO HANDLE THE SITUATION.  I HAD ED GAMBLIN, INSIDE SALES REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE OXNARD BRANCH, CONTACT THE CITY OF OXNARD FIRE DEPARTMENT AND EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT WE WERE DOING ABOUT IT.  I TOLD ED TO GIVE THE CITY OF OXNARD FIRE DEPARTMENT MY CELL PHONE NUMBER AND I WOULD EXPLAIN OUR PROPOSED RESPONSE.  I WAS CONTACTED BY GREG ABILLE, ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST FOR THE CITY OF OXNARD FIRE DEPARTMENT/CUPA DIVISION.  GREG AND I SPOKE WHILE I WAS EN-ROUTE TO OXNARD.  I EXPLAINED IN DETAIL WHAT MY PROPOSED RESPONSE WAS GOING TO BE AND WE ALSO SPOKE OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S INCIDENT.  GREG HAD SEEN IT ON THE NEWS AND KNEW THAT THIS WAS A RELATED INCIDENT.  GREG AGREED TO LET ME AND ECI HANDLE THIS WITH THE CITY OF OXNARD FIRE DEPARTMENT AS BACK-UP OPTION.  HE GAVE ME A CELL PHONE NUMBER TO CALL IF ANYTHING HAPPENED AND INSTRUCTED ME TO CALL HIM WHEN THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETED.  I ARRIVED ON SITE AT 5:30 P.M. ECI HAD NOT ARRIVED YET.  I PLACED A COUPLE OF CALLS TO FIND OUT THEIR EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL.  I HAD ONE OF THE OXNARD TRUCK DRIVERS ON STAND BY SO THAT WE COULD MOVE THE TRAILER FOR DECONTAMINATION. ECI ARRIVED AT 6:45 P.M. WITH A THREE-MAN RESPONSE TEAM.  I EXPLAINED WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE AND AFTER A REVIEW OF THE MSDS, AND A SHORT TAIL-GATE SAFETY MEETING, ECI PROCEEDED TO DON THEIR LEVEL ""B"" PPE.  UPON ENTRY THE TEAM FOUND THAT APPROX. 4 PINTS OF MATERIAL HAD LEAKED FROM THE TOP CLOSURE OF THE TOTE.  SAN LUIS OBISPO'S HAZ-MAT TEAM HAD INDEED TIGHTENED THE BOLT RING DOWN ON THE TOTE; HOWEVER, THEY FAILED TO ENSURE THE LID WAS ON STRAIGHT BEFORE DOING SO.  AS A RESULT, MORE HYDRAZINE AGAIN LEAKED OUT ONTO THE TOP OF THE TOTE, WITH A SMALL AMOUNT ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER. ECI OPENED THE LID, PUT ON THE NEW GASKET AS A PRECAUTION AND PROPERLY CLOSED THE CONTAINER.  USING ABSORBENT RAGS, ECI CLEANED UP THE MATERIAL AND PLACED THE RAGS IN PLASTIC BAG FOR DISPOSAL.
