THE AGENT TURNED THE ICE CHEST UPRIGHT TO STOP THE LEAK AND THEN CAME IN AND NOTIFIED ME OF THE SITUATION.  UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION I DIS- COVERED THAT THE LEAKING ICE CHEST CONTAINED HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (POISONOUS LIQUIDS N.O.S.).  I ADVISED THE AGENT TO STOP THE OPERATION UNTIL I INVES- TIGATED THE SITUATION FURTHER. I THEN PLACED A CALL TO CHEMTREC TO RECEIVE FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.  DURING THE INSPECTION OF THE ICE CHEST I DISCOVERED A BROKEN JAR.  BELIEVING THE SPILT LIQUID TO BE CONTAMINATED, I HAD THE AREA CLEARED AND NOTIFIED PORT AUTHORITY FIRE & POLICE DEPT.  I ALSO NOTIFI ED THE PROPER SUMMIT & EMERY PERSONNEL OF THE SITUATION. SEVEN SUMMIT EMP- LOYEES (INCLUDING MYSELF) WERE TAKEN TO ST. JAMES HOSPITAL FOR DECONTAMI- NATION.
