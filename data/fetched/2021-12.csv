The damaged portion of the affected package containers have all been cut off and added to the damaged hazmat package and bottles of corrosive liquid inside of a hazardous materials bag inside a sealed salvage drum. Personal protective equipment was used to transport and properly seal the damaged product. Absorbing material was used to clean up the area of the spill, and all of the undamaged hazardous materials were sealed in separate salvage drums before being labelled properly and sent out for delivery.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

The car had not been touched or switched yet by P&L switch crews, but was observed venting by an on duty switch crew (RS2P-01) at the north end of Paducah Yard at approximately 1744 hours.  Chemtrec, NRC, and all other notifications were made.  The car was moving to be stored per an agreement with Reagent in Paducah Yard, but had not been placed to storage at the time.  E3 was notified and responded to mitigate the leak.  This was primarily a vapor release only with a very small amount of product forming around the leak points likely from condensation.  E3 reported that 8 of 8 bolts on what they called the ""unloading valave"" were not even hand tight, as well as 4 out of 4 bolts being loose on the PRD.  When those bolts were tightened the leak stopped with no need for replacement or repair of any parts.  All gaskets and PRD device found to be in good working order and serviceable.",Improve inspection procedures at shipper to ensure cars are properly packaged and sealed prior to shipment.

The trailer was staged at the loading dock till morning.  First shift employees offloading inbound trucks on the main warehouse shipping dock noticed a strong odor of something burning.  After further investigation, employees noticed smoke billowing out from one of the drooped STO inbound trailers.  The fire alarm was pulled and the fire department contacted.  Employees and visitors quickly evacuated the facility and gathered at the rally point for a head count.  Local FD arrived, putting fire out.  Once fire was out and inspection saw a pallet of lead acid batteries stored on a wood pallet had burned/melted and damaged other pallets on the truck.  The lead acid batteries were stored on their side, stacked 3-5 high on multiple pallets.  The battery leads were not covered or taped.  The working assumption is a battery leaked and the pallet caught fire.    A third party clean up company via CURA came in the repackage the batteries and other containers that received damage.

The leaking drum was immediately overpacked to contain the release. Once overpacked, Veolia reassessed the situation thoroughly by reviewing the waste information profile sheet.  It was determined that the material may have corrosive characteristics based on the physical description of the material and associated EPA codes which could lead to further packaging complications.  Testing of the spilled liquid showed a PH of 2, so it is considered to be a corrosive material which could corrode metal drums. Upon further inspection, Veolia identified 4 additional drums slowly failing as well. At that point, Veolia decided to overpack all 12 drums in the shipment as an additional precaution to prevent a release while in transportation.",Remind the customer that waste material that has corrosive properties should not be packed in metal packagings.

I saw on the 200 Belt section at 5:30 that there was a Hazmat that was damaged and had writing from the driver that it was damaged with an arrow pointing to the leak. I quickly looked for PPE and once I was wearing them I put the damaged hazmat into a salvage drum and isolated it near our QA station. I promptly called the emergency contact information and informed upper management of the spill. DescribePack: The box is around 12x12x12 Inches, the upper left corner had signs of a leak and crystallization from the contents. Upon inspection found that there was a minimal leak from a loose cap.

MGR., TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",1 EDEN LN,FLANDERS,NJ,07836-8950,Facility,"A Veolia employee was unloading a tote at the Dayton 10-day intransit facility from a tandem box truck. This particular truck relies on the air bags of the tandems to support the weight in the back of the truck. The Veolia employee drove a fork lift onto the back of the truck to pick up a tote. After picking up the tote our employee tried to back into the warehouse. As the forklift drove back onto the dock plate the truck sank below the dock level. This put the forklift at an odd downward angle. To account for this angle the driver had to elevate the forks a little higher than he normally would.     As the employee was exiting the truck with the tote on the forklift, a combination of the liquid inside the tote sloshing around and the bumps from the tires hitting the dock plate caused the tote to slide on the forks. The employee tried to prevent this from occurring by manipulating the controls on the forklift. As the employee quickly reached for the controls we believe he may have tilted the forks in the wrong direction causing the tote to continue its slide off of the forks. The tote eventually fell from the forks and landed on its side.    Based on the employee statement and a review of the incident, it is believed the tote lacked any kind of bottom deckboard-type component to prevent the tote from tipping from the forks. The bottom deckboard components act as a cross bar which holds the tote onto the forks. With out these cross bars the tote was free to slide or bounce as the employee drove into the warehouse.    Due to the condition of the tote after tipping over it was determined that the material needed to be pumped into an undamaged tote for safe transport. This transfer was completed by a third party ER team.",1. The Veolia office in Dayton will no longer use forklifts for removing totes from a box truck. We will be using a pallet jack instead. This should eliminate the any potential for a reoccurrence of this incident.    2. The employee was retrained on forklift operation and safety following the incident.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Landstar requested AIE not to continue the clean up due to the shipper requesting the material to remain as is and shipped back.  At 1705 ET, Landstar requested AIE to return the next morning to separate impacted material from the non impacted material.  AIE could not return so Hepaco was dispatched and arrived on site at 1908 ET.  There is one busted supersack, and another that is not damaged, but slightly leaning. A good amount of the bags shifted in transit. The busted one is in the way of the non damaged supersack. HEPACO moved the bags around in order to access the leaning bag and advised that the supersack that initially appeared to be just slightly leaning turned out to have a hole at the bottom of the bag. HEPACO transferred the material into a cubic yard box.

An estimated 100 gallons was lost from the tote. VLT contracted with Environmental Management, Inc. (EMI) to provide a response and cleanup. EMI went to the site on Monday, December 20, 2021, and secured the site for the night. The following morning, Tuesday, December 21, 2021, EMI returned to site. The 15 undamaged totes were removed from the trailer and sprayed with a neutralizing material. The one (1) damaged tote had its contents, approximately 150 gallons, transferred to another tote provided by EMI. The free liquids inside the trailer were solidified with inert absorbents and these solids were placed into open-top 55-gallon drums. The tote which contained the transferred material was labeled properly. The trailer was then cleaned with the neutralizing material and the 15 undamaged totes and the one (1) tote with the transferred material or (16) totes total were reloaded and secured.
