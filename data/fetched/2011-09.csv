BNSF is going to file a 5800 report on this leak.  On 9-1-11 car was again found leaking on BNSf interchange track and leak from one of the bolts holding the cleanout and bottom outlet valve plate was leaking and a gain BNSF and CCT tightend the bolt stopping the leak. on 9/1/11 FRA then issued a one time verbal emergency move of 1.4 miles to the customer so that the car could be unloaded. FRA inspected the car with BNSF and CCT managers and then deemed car safe to move. Customer unloaed 9000 gallons of product on 9/1/11 and when car was checked again at 0600 on 9/2/11 car still not leaking at 0800 9/1/11 car was found leaking into containment vessel placed under the car in case car leaked and at 0845 CCT and customer personel again tightend the bolts on the bottom outlet valve plate and leak was stopped. The customer then completed the off load of the car at 1630 9/2/11. Car had just come from a shop on 1st trip after being relined.,"This car had just come out of a shop for relining and had the bottom outlet and the bottom outlet plate removed when the car was lined.  Car number FURX120552.  The shop alos removed the VRV, and the top fittings from the pressure plate on the car. After the car was relined there was no pressure test done on the car.    There is a posssibilty this car after being lined did not have a gasket placed on the bottom outlet plate or the new lining fouled the plate seat and this caused product to leak around the threads on the plate and leak out of the car. this material is corrosive and it could have stated to corrode the threads on the bolt and this allow the leak to start again once the bolt was tightened after the 1st leak was noticed and then to leak again after being tightened again for a 2nd time.

The suspect cars are PPGX 1329 and PPGX 1382. Both tank cars are Residue Last Contained: Chlorine UN1017.  Two chlorep approved contractor responders from USES, Jackson, Mississippi were mobilized to the yard. Don Warren, with USES, responded and found leak originating from tank car PPGX 1329. Upon arrival the protective housing was found in the closed, pinned and sealed position. The protective housing seal was removed to access the fittings. The leak sourced from a loose B-end liquid valve (1/4 turn open) and a loose B-end secondary closure plug (hand tight). The B-end liquid valve was closed tight and the secondory closure plug was tightened tool tight correcting and stopping the release. The responder also found the other liguid valve and both vapor vavles loose (1/4 turn open) and all three secondary closure plugs were loose (one full turn to be tool tight). These were also closed and tightened by the responder.     Responders from EI DUpont, Delisle, MS responded to KCS Jackson, MS yard approximately three hours later to inspect the field mitigation efforts. The field work conducted by USES was approved. The protective housing was then closed, pinned and sealed. The PPGX was released back into transporation.       Shipper offered this tank car into transportation with the tank closures not completely tight. KCS emergency services were activated to provide for railroad safety qualified services to mitigate this emergency (e.g., special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, track protection and lockout, emergency response, management oversight, train/yard crew delay).  KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 will apply for these services.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.  The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs.",No,TANK CAR,,105J500W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

Inside was another box. That inner package is shown in photo ""PDX Tag.jpg"" which had a component tag in a clear plastic sleeve, with a fluorescent pink label ""ALWAYS SHIP HAZMAT."" As can be seen in the photo, there is a trefoil symbol on the tag. This icon is used to flag hazardous materials in the parts system, TRAX. The part detail is attached as well, and shows that Horizon had already identified and communicated that the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) is to be shipped as UN3091, Lithium metal batteries contained in equipment, 9, II.    2) The COMAT box traveled on flight 2593, operated by Q400 N423QX, which departed PDX at 19:54 and arrived BOI nonstop at 22:10 on September 6. The flight crew was not informed they were transporting hazmat, as there was no indication on the outer package, much less a shipping paper, available to cargo or ramp personnel that there was hazmat.    3) Horizon Air immediately began an investigation.

ERTS dispatched Millstead Environmental to the site to investigate the incident and begin cleanup operations. After further investigation from the Conroe County Hazmat personnel it was determined that no release occurred due to this incident. The NRC was notified due to the roadway being closed for over two hours. Millstead Environmental personnel secured the totes on the trailer and then off loaded them onto the shoulder of the roadway utilizing a forklift. Millstead Environmental personnel then utilized the forklift to load the undamaged totes onto the replacement trailer provided by Covenant Transport.

No liquid product escaped from the intermodal container's interior. The beneficial shipper was notified and contract responders were dispatched. The responders reported that a loose bunghole cap-seal was found atop one of three like drums in the shipment. The loose bunghole cap-seal allowed some product to escape from the bunghole orifice during movement. The responders replaced the loose cap-seal with another suitable bunghole cap-seal, thus securing the bunghole. Spillage that mainly stayed atop the drum head was neutralized and then wiped.

Hoskins Road,Charlotte,NC,28216,Facility,"NARRATIVE:   On 9/1/11 at 0855 a Code Yellow was called when the loader discovered Special Lactolite spilling out of the trailer's rear valve. Loader was in the process of a top load transload from R/C UTLX 500001 to Trimac trailer 47-1457. Loader noticed that the rear unloading valve was open and the cap was off that caused the release of approximately 50 gallons of product onto the ground. No drains were impacted. Carolina Emergency Response Team (CERT) was notified and is on site to assist in the clean up.  Code White was called at 1015.    AWARENESS ITEM:   1. This was the second Special Lactolite load of the day.  2. Rear unloading valve was open and cap was left off after tank completed washout.  3. Loader was trained on SSP and EDC on 8/22/11.  4. Ensure truck arrival inspections are thoroughly performed upon trailer arrival.     ROOT CAUSES:   1. Failure of loader and verifier to properly perform Haz-Mat Trailer Inspection due to their collective work load being heavy and their minds being off the task. By completing the inspection form properly, the point of failure (open valve and cap off) would have been identified and corrected.","CORRECTIVE ACTION:   1.

ROBERT,PRESIDENT,5423 LA Highway 44,GONZALES,LA,70737,Carrier,"On 9/3/11, Bobtail transport vehicle B-57 was transporting a load of diesel fuel to Carville Job Corps Center.  We had extremely stormy weather conditions due to Tropical Storm Lee.  At 09:23 on Point Clair Road approx. 1/2 mile from the delivery point, the driver lost control and the truck rolled onto its side and into the roadside ditch.  The driver was not injured except for a bruised arm, and was able to climb out of the truck on his own.  There were no other injuries and no other people or vehicles were involved in the accident.  There was no personal property damage other than the area of the spill.  A passer-by called 911,and the driver called our Dispatcher, John Disotelll and notified him of the rollover and that diesel was leaking from the cargo tank.  John immediately started calling the State Police Hotline number, which was busy, and departed for the accident site.  The St. Gabriel Fire Dept. arrived at 09:31, and noted that one of the 700-gallon compartments was leaking from the void space, and approx. 12 - 15 gallons of diesel was on the ground at that point.  The fire dept. called DOTD and requested two loads of sand, one for the spill and another for the ditch to prevent runoff.  John dispatched a second driver and bobtail to off-load the diesel, and he and the second driver loaded absorbent pads and boom from the warehouse.  State Police Trooper Lewis arrived at approx. 11:00.  John and the Robert Distr. bobtail and driver arrived at 11:14 to begin offloading diesel.  John finally got through to the Louisiana Hazmat Hotline, and he and the driver began containing the discharged diesel.  City of St. Gabriel backhoe was on scene.  The fire chief requested DOTD dispatch a dump truck with spreader.  Iberville Parish dump truck arrived with sand at 11:23.  United States Environmental Services Group (USES) was called around 11:30 to continue cleanup.  LDEQ arrived on scene at 12:26.  DOTD arrived with spreader at 12:35.  USES arrived at 12:45, met with Hazmat Trooper Lewis and assessed the incident.  USES proceeded to drill the tank truck to remove and transfer the product to the Robert bobtail.  Transfer was completed by 14:45.  Once the damaged truck was recovered, cleanup was resumed at approximately 16:30.  Water provided by the fire dept. was used to wash the diesel to one end and recover it with a vacuum truck.  LDEQ was on site to oversee the cleanup.  USES worked until 21:00, at which time they left due to severe weather conditions.  USES returned on 9/4/11 to continue the cleanup with the assistance of the local fire dept.  Cleanup was completed by 11:30, and sorbent boom was left in place at recommendation of LDEQ.  Recovered product was sent for disposal to A3M in Reserve, LA.  On 9/9/11, USES returned on site with LDEQ for recommendations of further remediation.  LDEQ suggested bio-remediation with Micro Blaze and fertilizer and leave sorbent boom in place until first rainfall.  On 9/12/11, USES returned on site to apply t","When we have our quartely safety meetings or special meetings, we will re-emphasize to the drivers that if weather conditions are extreme, they are to pull off the road to a safe location.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,220157,"Roland J.

Driver attempted to exit highway on to ramp at too high of speed causing a one vehicle overturn accident.  At this time it is not known the exact location of package failure, however the cargo tank did separate from the chassis.  Duration of release was believed to be over several hours as the emergency responders were figuring out how to recover tank out of swale.  It was finally determined to use a vacuum truck to transfer remaining fuel out of separated cargo tank into another company truck.  Recovered product was 1,100 gallons.  Emergency Environmental Response Company diked off all drains leading into swale (final resting location of cargo tank).  Drains only drained one way into swale, and did not lead into any other water systems.  Only impact was to surface soil.  Remediation cleanup is completed at this time.  Sampling shows there was no impact to ground water and soil samples are all within Florida state guidelines after cleanup.","We are going to stress to our drivers that posted speed limits on exit ramps are for cars, and not commercial vehicles.

Closure report showed no leakage.   When railcar arrived at Rail yard in Odessa TX the railcar was found leaking on a pinhole in the jacket on a weld seam on the side of the railcar.  The West Texas and Lubbock Railway pushed the railcar into the customer location.  It was assumed that 30 gallons of HCL was spilled on the rail tracks while pushing the railcar into Cooper Energy's yard.  The spill was decontaminated and the railcar was offloaded and emptied.  The railcar is owned by the customer and not Univar.  Univar dispatched three operators from Odessa yard to rail yard site. It was determined that a leak developed on the under side of the railcar in a weld seam.  The car was pushed into the customer location and emptied.  Estimated quantity based on volume is 30 gallons.,No recommendations at this time.    Railcar had been in prior service.   Post fill and pre trip inspections were completed.

All appropriate departments notified, tank car isolated. CN's response team responded noting the bottom outlet valve handle in the closed position, shipper's seal intact and product dripping from the cap area. Further inspection noted the cap was tool tight. An attempt was made to re-secure the cap, which reduced the frequency of the dripping, but did not stop it. Patching material was applied to the cap threads, which stopped the leak. The consignee and FRA Hazardous Materials Inspector M. Bennett were notified of the repairs and the consignee agreed to accept the tank car for off-loading. Inspector Bennett issued a verbal authorization to move the car a short distance to the consignee's facility to facilitate the safe off-loading of product.

The  facility  is  presently  in  bankruptcy  and  Community  South  Lending  of  Tennessee  is overseeing the facility closure which includes removal of wastes abandoned by McKee Craft. Steve Gross of Community South contacted Global Environmental Assurance to provide waste removal services.  Jimmy Beliveau, Global Environmental Assurance, PO Box 337, St. George, SC 29477 packaged the material for shipment and contacted Environmental Options, Inc. to transport to the disposal facility.   At the point of pick-up Key Mckee signed the manifest certifying that the waste was ""classified, packaged, marked and labeled/placarded and are in all aspects in proper condition for transport according to applicable international and national government regulations."" As determined later, this was not the case. During the investigation of the  incident  it  was  determined  the  materials  were  improperly  packaged and  prepared  for shipment by Global Environmental Assurance (Jimmy Beliveau). Specifically the following has been determined:    1.  The MEKP containers contained holes and were placed in the containers with packing material.  2.  Improper  packing  materials-the  absorbent  seemed  to  be  a  residential  kitty  litter containing odor control crystals which would be incompatible with MEKP.   This incompatibility would cause an exothermic reaction if the two came in contact with one another which would be highly likely when containers with holes were placed in the drums.  3.  The items were placed on top of the packing material not surrounded by and cushioned to prevent breakage or leaking and to maintain the container in an upright position during transport.  4.  A creme hardener containing 30-60% benzoyl peroxide was packed with the MEKP and would be incompatible with the MEKP and should have been packaged separately.     It is our belief that the fire on our vehicle was a direct result of improper packaging by Global Environmental Assurance (Jimmy Beliveau). Key Mckee also certified by his signature that the material was properly packaged.    During transport the driver of the transport vehicle noticed smoke coming from the rear of his trailer and pulled to the side of the road.  A police officer from the Suffolk Police department pulled in behind him.  The Suffolk Fire department was notified and responded along with the Portsmouth and Chesapeake Hazmat teams.   The Hazmat team made entry into the trailer and determined that 2 drums of organic peroxides had been on fire but at this point the fire was out and the situation was stable.  A private company, PetroChem was contracted to complete the repacking of materials and to insure that all remaining containers were not compromised during the i","WE ARE CHANGING OUR PROCEDURES TO REQUIRE ALL BROKERS TO PROVIDE US WITH COPIES OF ALL PAPERWORK TWO DAYS PRIOR TO OUR PICKING UP THEIR CLIENTS WASTE.

A Transfer was being conducted between railcar (GATX 49425) and a single compartment trailer (22059) with a single dome. The loader noticed product leaking down the side of the railcar. The loader climbed to the top of the railcar and noticed product leaking from the jumper hose between the Air tee valve and the Product tee valve. The loader closed the product valve and then called code yellow. The product was contained inside the track pans; no product contacted the ground, water or drains.  Team members responded to the code yellow and immediately brimmed and dike inside the track pan. Vinegar used to neutralize, and sand was used absorb the Caustic.     AWARENESS ITEMS:   1. The Terminal Manager re-reviewed the SSP for transferring corrosive product via blower pac/air compressor on 8-9-2011  2. Ensure all valves, fittings, hoses and tools required to perform the assigned task are inspected as part of the daily inspection.    3. The ruptured airline was replaced 2 weeks ago.    4. The Loader was fully trained on this transfer and demonstrated proficiency.",ROOT CAUSES:  1. Loader inadvertently opened the product valve and introduced product to the air line.    2. The jumper hose between air valve assembly and the product valve assembly ruptured when product was introduced.      CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  1. Retrain all employees to ensure valves are operated in accordance to the SSP.  Re-training will be documented on Form 1686.    2.

The response crew closed the valve to stop the release.  The cabinet was left open for an hour to allow the frost to clear and the piping to further thaw. There were no additional leaks observed.

Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 will apply for these services and invoice will be provided to offeror under separate cover.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.  The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs.",No,TANK CAR,,112J340W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

The operator was wearing hard hat, glasses and leather gloves.  It is unclear what happened next but his partner had just left him to go finish some paperwork when he heard him yell for help.   The load partner stepped out of the loaders office and saw the other loader running towards him with acid dripping from his face and torso area.  Several other employees nearby heard the loader yell for help and assisted with placing him in a safety shower.   The plant immediately launched into a full response mode and called for medical helicopter to transport the individual to a nearby burn hospital based on their assessment of his condition.

Vehicle 1 drifted near the northbound fog line causing trailer 2 to drive off the roadway and go onto the dirt shoulder.  Driver then steered to the left, causing vehicle 1 and trailer 1 to travel in a northwest direction. Vehicle 1 then crossed the center line and went into the southbound lane. Trailer 2 then went off the roadway. Trailer 2 began to fishtail and then slid broadside. Trailer 2 then rolled over (531) onto its left side in the southbound lane. Upon impact or shortly after trailer two opened up spilling its contents, Vehicular Crash or Accident Damage (537). The driver then steered to the right bringing vehicle 1, trailer 1 and trailer 2 back into the northbound lane. Vehicle 1 and trailer 1 remained in the northbound lane, while trailer 2 came to rest on the northbound shoulder, in the dirt, on its left side, facing northwest.  The proper authorities were notified to report the spill (NRC, NVCA). A hazmat company was also notified for the initial spill response and latter the spill clean-up. The contaminated soil has been removed and the soil has been or is in the process of being replaced.  The tank failed because of the impact with the road surface, while sliding on the roadway the left side could have been abraded (301), ripped or torn (310) causing its content to leak (308).","Continued training, a review of the accident in a safety meeting (what, when, where, how and why).

GROOMS,MANAGER OF ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES,800 W. Montgomery Avenue,Philadelphia,PA,19122,Other-CTMV owner,"Philadelphia Gas Works (PGW) has reviewed the available information relating to the diesel fuel release incident that occurred on September 28, 2011 in the vicinity of the Cottman Avenue exit from I-95 in Philadelphia, PA from a PGW owned Cargo Tank Motor Vehicle (CTMV).  As such, PGW has determined that there are several actions that can be taken in order to assist in avoiding another incident similar to the one that occurred on September 28, 2011, and they are listed as follows:    PGW has outsourced the majority of the fueling service operations to an outside vendor.  As such, the vendor will assume the responsibility of ensuring that all safety protocols associated with fuel transportation and fuel deliveries are implemented.  PGW will review the vendor’s safety plan and operating procedures to ensure that necessary steps are being taken to avoid future incidents.  By contracting with an outside vendor, PGW believes that the vendor’s expertise in the specialized area of fueling services will reduce the chances of a diesel fuel release.  PGW does intend to keep one or two (to be determined) CTMV’s available for backup and emergency situations only;    For the PGW CTMV/s that will be used as backup and emergencies, the hoses located on the CTMV’s will be encased in a material that reduces the chance of abrasion and hose failure such as that which occurred in September, which led to a diesel fuel release;    PGW will ensure that inspections of CTMV’s are conducted on a regular basis;  PGW operating procedures will be reviewed and updated as needed to ensure safety.","Account #1    On Wednesday evening September 28, 2011 at approximately 9:15 pm I (Tina Roonan) received a call from Supply Chain’s driver1, Mr. Michael Hatala.  He advised me (Tina Roonan) that while on his way to Castor Station to fuel vehicles, he was traveling northbound on 95 approaching the off ramp for Cottman Ave. when he noticed smoke coming from the back of his truck, vehicle #5524.  He exited onto Cottman Avenue and traveled westbound crossing Torresdale Avenue and turned north onto Ditman Street, where he parked.      When he exited the vehicle he realized that diesel fuel was pouring out of the truck.  I (Tina Roonan) contacted Transportation and advised Mr. Ellis Steptoe and Mr. John McCoy of the situation.  John stated “he would send a mechanic up as soon as he could”.  Mr. Hatala then called me back and notified me that he was approached by a second alarmer (this is a volunteer that backs up the fire department) and notified Mr. Hatala that he was leaking diesel fuel, and it started back on the off ramp.  After being advised of the situation I (Tina Roonan) contacted Mr. John McCoy, advising him that the Fire Department was involved (and on the scene).  I (Tina Roonan) then left and went to the site of the incident.    When I (Tina Roonan) arrived on site various fireman were trying to stop the truck from leaking.  There were many fireman, police and equipment on site.  The fireman and equipment were from the 12th platoon out of the Hartel Street and Frankford Avenue fire station.  The Chief was Chief Fortuna.  They were able to stop the truck from leaking.  Mr. Robert Gonsiewski Supervisor, Industrial Waste Unit from the Philadelphia Water Department was on site to evaluate the situation surrounding the storm drain.  He approximated there to be approximately 30 gallons of diesel fuel that entered the storm drain.     Lieutenant George Cuthbert from the Hazardous Materials Administrative Unit of the Philadelphia Fire Department evaluated the site and labeled it a “Hazmat Site”.  He asked if PGW would hire their own Hazmat Contractor or if we (PGW representatives) would like him to do this for us.  Jo Ann Muniz via telephone requested that they bring in their contractor to perform the hazmat clean up.  He stated he would contact a company named “Clean Venture” to perform the clean up.  He also stated that a PGW supervisor must stay on site with the contractor until the clean up was completed.  Clean Venture arrived on site at approximately 12:30 am cleaned up the site along with the City of Philadelphia Streets Department, pumping approximately 75/80 gallons of a diesel/water mixture from the storm drain.  The clean up was completed at approximately 2:45 AM .    Account #2 (Steven Kernaghan)    The Clean Venture / Cycle Chem was contacted by the Philadelphia Fire Department Hazmat Division and Trevor Alexander the Lab Pack Chemist/Supervisor responded to the call.

ENV. AFFAIRS,DEKA ROAD,LYON STATION,PA,19536,Carrier,"An East Penn Driver was hauling a load of spent lead acid batteries from our West Babylon, NY warehouse to our secondary lead smelter in Lyons Station, PA.  While returning home on south I 95, mile marker 120/8, after crossing over the George Washington Bridge, another truck driver pulled up along side of him letting him know that he saw smoke coming out of his trailer and the he should pull over.  The driver pulled onto the shoulder of the road and called 911.  The driver and the other truck driver tried to extinguish the fire without success.  State police, Bergan County Haz Mat team, Turnpike Authorities and the LeOnia fire company arrived on the scene.    The driver did call back to Lyons Station to inform personnel of the incident.  The  Bergan County Haz Mat Team helped to contain the spill and also contacted Ken Marine Services for clean up after confirming with East Penn's Environmental Department.  The LeOnia Fire Department put out the fire.  NJ DEP also arrived on the scene.  According to the turnpike official and the Haz Mat team, there was run off into a near by storm drain.    The fire did burn a hole through the roof and buckled the sides of the trailer.  Ken's Marine transferred the junk batteries, after draining the acid from the batteries and over packing the drained spent batteries, onto another East Penn trailer.  The over packed batteries were shipped to EPM Lyon Station for proper disposal/recycle.  The acid and PPE from the clean up crew was disposed of as hazardous waste.    The NJ DEP did investigate the run off into the storm drain.  The outlet of the storm drain was tested before and after a rain with no change in pH.  The test was neutral.  According to the NJ DEP no more needed to be monitored.  All was clear.    The burnt trailer once emptied was towed to a near by scrap yard.  It was neutralized by Ken's Marine and disposed of as a neutralized waste solid to Cycle Chem, NJ.  The water used to clean the trailer was also captured and sent out as a Hazardous waste to Cycle Chern.    It is unknown how exactly the fire started.  It is assumed that 2, side terminal batteries touched causing an arch starting the fire.  The batteries are stacked on a wooden pallet with cardboard in between layers and stretch wrapped to the pallet.  The pallets are blocked and braced to prevent movement.","A memo was sent out to ALL East Penn Warehouses, branches, subsidiaries and EPM drivers.  The memo re-instructed the proper packaging of side terminal batteries on the skid and the proper placement on the trailer.  The memo instructions were as follows:     - Make sure all batteries that have side terminals are stacked properly on a skid.  They must be stacked on the pallet so their terminals do not touch and other terminals of the same type or another battery type.   - If you know the pallet has quantities of side terminal batteries and your customer wrapped it, you need to open the pallet and check to make sure that the batteries were placed properly on the skid.   - If you have a full pallet of side terminal batteries, they are to be wrapped with cardboard around the outside of the pallet to protect the terminals even further.   - Make sure when you load pallets with side terminals on the trailer, be sure the pallets are positioned that no terminals on any side of the batteries are facing each other.",Yes,BATTERY,battery for holding battery fluid,BATTERY,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,117460,"EAST PENN MFG.

It appears that our driver drifted off the road to the left hitting bridge.    The tractor was badly burnt as well as the dolly and lead trailer. About 60 gallons of diesel spilled from gas tank, as well as hazmat that was in one of the trailers.  No hazmat in other trailer.  Driver treated and released from the emergency room with bruises and 1st degree burns to his lower extremities. Fire extinguished.  Ohio EPA removed a possibly contaminated puddle near the scene.      From news reports: 'The Trumbull County HazMat team worked alongside others in the spot where a second trailer fell over the bridge. It landed in a field and no homes or businesses there. The first focus of the cleanup was the bridge area so it could re-open to traffic. That happened around 7 p.m. Wednesday. But as traffic started flowing again, HazMat workers and EPA officials were still busy. ""Fortunately it went very smoothly for us. We were able to contain it and control it,"" Don Waldron, Trumbull County HazMat chief said. A green vacuum truck and storage container from Inland Environmental Emergency Response Service was sucking up the hazardous materials from the ground. It's then pumped into a bin and will eventually be hauled away. Waldron said there's no environmental concerns. Interstate Towing out of Macedonia was removing the semi-truck debris. The smell of leaked materials affected some of the workers.'  Agencies notified / On scene:  OEPA # 1109-78-2895, NRC - P.O.

RELEASE INFORMATION    The incident began at approximately 10:30 PM on Monday, September 19, 2011with a tanker truck operated by Silvana Pelleche Trucking overturning on SR-38 near milepost 23.7.  The tanker was traveling eastbound (uphill)  with a load of approximately 8,200 to 8,400 gallons of gasoline for delivery to a gas station  in Big Bear, California.  The tanker turned over on its right side and slid into a low earthen embankment on the south side of SR-38. The driver was apparently  unhurt.  All compartments of the approximately 9,000-gallon capacity tanker were punctured and the fuel leaked onto the bare ground between the roadway and the embankment. Most of the fuel from the tanker spilled onto the ground and ran downhill (southwest) along the south side of SR-38 until it reached an informal drainage  basin that trended back to the east toward a flowing waterway, Forsee Creek, a tributary of the Santa Ana River. The gasoline ponded In the drainage basin behind a berm which prevented it from entering the creek.  The tanker's  inverted diesel fuel tanks also spilled up to roughly 100 gallons of fuel onto the roadway through the fill ports.  The diesel fuel and crankcase oil ran across the road to the northwest where it was absorbed by another earthen  embankment.  The CA Highway Patrol, Caltrans, and local fire departments responded to the incident. The U.S. Forest Service also had representatives at the scene.  The CHP and Caltrans contacted emergency response contractor Double Barrel Environmental Services (DBES) for assistance with the emergency response actions.  Dean Matsuoka was the first DBES employee on the scene.  According to Mr. Matsuoka, two vacuum tanker trucks  were ordered to the scene, which were able to recover approximately 1,000 gallons of fuel from the tanker and 1,200 gallons of fuel from the ponded area in the acijacent drainage basin.    Based on DBES' account  of the incident, 6,000 gallons of fuel were released into environment, primarily by soaking into the ground.  The fuel traveled overland approximately 200 to 250 feet to the southwest and then east into the drainage basin.  The incident  occurred in a rather steep-sided ravine that was partially filled for the roadway.  The site was underlain  by unconsolidated gravelly sand beneath the roadway and turnout.   Native materials beneath the road bed consisted of a veneer of sand and gravel alluvial soil over fractured granitic rock.  The area beyond the road and turnout was lightly to densely vegetated with native shrubs, grasses, and mature trees.  The truck crash apparently  occurred  on the Caltrans right-of-way. Fuel leaking from the tanker flowed along the side of the road and then f","SINCE THE RELEASE WAS ACCIDENTAL, NO PLANS CURRENTLY EXIST TO PREVENT RECURRENCE.
