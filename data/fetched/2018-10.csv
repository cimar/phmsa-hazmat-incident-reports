ERLLC was dispatched to assist the driver with the cleanup and to help  repackage the material from the leaking IBC into 2 poly drums.  Upon completion of the cleanup and  repacking the Veolia driver proceeded to the Veolia facility.  The GA DNR hotline was notified of the  incident (report #87603).",The Veolia Operations Manager met with the customer on 10/9/18 to review the incident. While  remediating the spill it was identified that the IBC was improperly filled with damaged/leaking liquid  containers.  The customer was trained on the proper usage of absorbent material when packaging waste materials in accordance with 49 CFR 173.12(b) and has since chosen to package all liquid containers into drums to alleviate any future occurrence.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2000,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The sherriff noticed material leaking from the valve box of our trailer.  Our driver was able to contain the rest of the leak by closing the valve.  The valve had opened and the secondary valve was not holding properly.  The valve box does have a containment area in the belly of the trailer that was full.  Approximately 50 gallons were in the trailer belly that we drained and put into another compartment.  This compartment had 200 gallons loaded in it, so we are estimating 150 gallons were spilled along the highway.  We sent a crew out to do clean up along the route the driver took.  It was fisrt noticed at the intersection of the south El Dorado truck route and highway 54 when our driver turned south.  There were no pooling areas of spills to clean up, there were just several areas along the highway where we could tell something had spilled and got on the roadway.  Our crew caught up to our driver and helped him with clean up of his trailer belly.  The crew then went back the same way to make sure no areas on the roadway needed clean up.  Our crew reported no such areas needed spill clean up.  The sherriff was also going to go back through the route to see if anything needed to be done.  This entire stretch of roadway from where the first notice of spillage was to where our driver pulled over was about 12 miles.","We have since sent this trailer into the shop to be looked over and have all the valves checked and secondary valves worked on as well.  We are hoping the shop can determine what may have caused the failure, as this is not a normal occurrance.  Other options to help with this would be to install locking valve handles and valve outlet caps.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,"BARTON SOLVENTS, INC.",US,

At 0205 ET, the driver was offloading a shipment of UN1993 Diesel Fuel (Hauls 7500 gallons) to the customer location, when the offload was finish and the hose was disconnected, approximately 20 gallons of fuel released to the concrete pad and a storm drain in the area. The driver immediately deployed a spill kit in his tractor to contain what he could. Driver inspected the storm drain with a flashlight and determined that the fuel reached the bottom of the storm drain but not the outflow pipe. The impacted absorbents and debris placed down were contained into a 5 gallon bucket and was taken back to his facility for disposal. The spill is located along an unnamed side street that runs against the RTA building and the spill is located approximately 200 feet off of the Lakewood Heights Blvd street intersection on a concrete pad. ERTS contacted HEPACO for a dispatch, ETA is 1 hour and 30 minutes. At 0600 ET, HEPACO personnel completed work. The Facility Manager for Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, Michael Pulleo arrived on site and confirmed that the storm sewer area had a cave in causing ground water to run through the drain. HEPACO personnel inspected the next drain, approximately 100-150’ away in the middle of Lakewood Blvd but it was bone dry. Per HEPACO personnel they saw a large amount of dirt in the storm drain that may have absorbed the diesel fuel released. There was no visible sheen on water in the storm drain. The initial caller reported the tanker was hauling approximately 7500 gallons of UN1993 fuel and the delivery was made to two underground 20,000 gallon tanks for the amount of 3500 gallons in Tank 1 and 4000 gallons in Tank 2 which adds up to the 7500 gallons leaving a small amount of product to release possibly 15-20 gallons. HEPACO personnel was able to apply granular absorbents and pads to the concrete area. All impacted absorbents and debris were collected and containerized for waste disposal.

On October 1, Neier's driver conducted his pre-trip inspection, including a visual inspection of cargo, and adjusted load securement prior to transportation.  At this time there was no indication of leaking containers.  After departing Indianapolis, he became aware of material dripping from the trailer in Butler County OH and immediately pulled over to assess the situation, distribute material absorbents and buckets, and contacted emergency services.  Neier contracted an emergency remediation service to inspect, diagnose, and clean up the equipment and stopping location.  Upon arrival, the remediation company discovered liquid material on the interior floor of the trailer, but was unable to identify the leaking container at that time.  Neier equipment and the remediation company were escorted off the emergency lane of the roadway to a nearby travel plaza where the leaking drum was identified.  The leaking drum had a bung located on the side, approximately 8"" from the bottom where material was slowly seeping out.  The remediation company reported that it was difficult to identify the leaking container due to it's position among the other shipping containers.  The drum was overpacked and the trailer floor was cleaned again prior to further transportation.",The shipper should select proper packaging for the materials offered for transportation and ensure they are securely closed.

The exterior inspection revealed a liquid material emitting from underneath the container over the landing gear. The interior inspection revealed mixed containers of acetone containers and a 55 gallon drums of hazmat secured with void filler and Ty Gard at the rear of the load. The drums were found stowed in 2, 2 pattern against the walls in a single layer. Patriot Environmental was dispatched to remediate the leak at our facility. The leak material was determined to a hazmat Acetone emitting from one (1) steel 55 gallon drum. Patriot determined the leak was caused due to a damage and bent ring at the bottom of a 55 gallon drum. Damage to the drum most likely occurred prior to loading at origin. The leaking drum lost approximately 10 gallons; drum was over packed and disposed of by Patriot Environmental.",Shipper should ensure that drums are adequate for transportation and that the load is properly secured to prevent damage to containers while in transit.,No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5050,BNSF - BNSF Railway Company,US,

The tank car was isolated and  the shipper NGL Supply Wholesale (Centennial Energy),  were notified via Chemtrec, report #  2018-10-30-00323. Conrail Hazardous Material Manager, Joe Caccamo along with Hepaco, a Conrail  response contractor, was dispatched to the Port Reading Yard and found a slow drip from the threads  above the bell housing cap below the internal valve. There was no less than tool tight condition found  and it appeared to be a valve issue.  The valve was an updated DOT 117 with disengaging handle. After further inspection it appeared that the  valve was not in a fully closed position as the valve stem nut was not against the stopping point. The nut  was turned with a wrench to  close the approximate remaining 10 degrees. After the valve appeared fully  closed the bell housing assembly was removed and the content of product was drained into a spill pan. After further inspection a small amount of product was still dripping past the internal ball valve and  could not be stopped completely. The Shipper Representative, Brent Foster (720) 317-7145 was made  aware that a transfer would be required.The tank car was re-secured and a spill catch pan was used  to capture any leakage in case the piping below the valve was to fill and leak again.  The transfer of the contents took place on Monday, November 5, 2018 without incident and the contents  of PROX 44241 were transferred into UTLX 212953. The Shipper was notified that a One Time Movement Approval (OTMA) category 1 would be required before transportation to Home Shop could be performed.

Location of tank was described to Lykins has: 275-gallon tank outside by driveway. Driver made delivery to the only visible outside tank which was located behind the garage. Garage tank was outside near driveway and had an oil line entering the garage. However, this was the incorrect tank. The correct tank was next to driveway and attached to the house in an enclosure. The tank was not visible because it was enclosed by same material as the main house. The tank by the garage had since been not in use. Previously the oil line from the tank had been disconnected on the inside of the garage from a furnace which had been previously removed and the value was left open. The spill occurred from 10/26/18 to 10/27/18, approximately 180 gallons leaked out into the garage. Lykins were made aware of the spill on 10/29/18. Customer stated he had cleaned up the spill and was not worried about any damage to his property. On 10/31/18 Lykins pumped the rest of the product out in the garage tank and assessed the damage. No evidence of the spill was visible outside of the garage. On 11/2/2018 Lykins reported the spill, NRC # 1229242 and Ohio EPA # 1811-EPA-0001993. At 1252 on 11/2/18, Lykins spoke with Ohio EPA and informed them of the situation. On 11/2/18 at approximately 1430, Lykins and Environmental Management Specialists, Inc. and Highland County EMA arrived at the spill location. They assessed the spill and any property damage or environmental concerns. The only evidence of the spill was inside the garage, except for a small area by the garage door in the yard. No other evidence of the spill was observed on the ground anywhere outside the garage. Environmental Management Specialists, Inc. treated the inside of the garage with Micro-Blaze and the surrounding area outside of the garage as a precaution. Lykins spoke with Ohio EPA again at approximately 1515 on 11/2/2018 and informed them of the assessment and what actions were taken. Ohio EPA was okay with the actions and assessment, then, informed Lykins they were going to close the report and no further action is needed.","Lykins reviews all incidents, in order, to determine the root cause, preventability, and what actions, i.e. training or procedures, need to be conducted or implemented so that the incident will not happen again. Lykins is currently conducting the third round of driver safety meetings for the year and is reviewing this incident with them directly. At these meetings we have been emphasizing the importance of detailed descriptions and being cautious as a driver when delivering. If drivers feel uneasy or are unsure about their delivery location and/or oil tank location, they are to immediately call their supervisor/manager to verify the details of this location. Their supervisor/manager can then contact the customer to get more information and inform the driver with the correct detailed directions before the driver begins the process.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,Lykins Energy Solutions,US,

Slick Response and ITC were notified of the incident and both arrived on scene at approximately 1740 hours.  Inspection found that the bottom outlet valve cap was not tool tight and the bottom outlet valve stem and handle assembly would not completely close the valve.  ITC personnel used a wrench on the valve stem to get the valve closed completely, they then tightened the bottom outlet cap to tool tight condition.  The car was set out awaiting OTMA to ITC to have the valve assembly repaired.    OTMA FRA 181018969 was issued on November 28, 2018 and the car was removed from bad order status for movement to ITC for unloading and repairs.",ITC is handling the repairs to the valve stem and handle assembly.
