After arrival at the aircraft it was determined that the affected area was in the forward belly of the A/C and that there was no longer any odor up there and the small amount of liquid had been cleaned up. A/C maintenance had already cleared the A/C of any adverse effects. I was informed that MOD Denny O’Connell and the TSA had taken a few suspect bags to screen them. The TSA subsequently cleared those bags as No Threat but one of the bags had a lot of cologne and other fragrances and some of the clothes in it were wet. This was determined to be the bag that contained the source of the liquid/odor.     Upon examining the bag and looking inside for the actual source, one spray can of Axe had no top and appeared to have been pressed while in the bag. It was determined to have likely been in a state of continual spray, which explained the wet belongings in the bag and the strong, sweet odor.     The clothes and other affected cloth items were hung over a rail to dry (these were never subsequently forwarded due to residual vapor concerns). Other smaller, safe items were put in a small plastic bag and eventually forwarded to final destination. The other potentially unsafe items were disposed of locally. There was also a can of spray suede that is more like an aerosol can of non-latex spray paint with a heavy ether smell that was also not forwarded.",Cap in place on top of commercial product to prevent accidental activation.

Tanker 103 contained flammable liquid waste.  While in route the driver was alerted that material from the dome area had leaked on to the side of the tanker.  The driver immediately pulled to the side of Highway 231 in Crawfordsville, Indiana and discovered a minimal amount of waste had splashed on to the side of tank.   The driver immediately placed absorbent materials under the trailer as preventative measures and then contacted the Tradebe Environmental personnel.   Tradebe Environmental personnel contracted a local environmental response contractor to conduct the corrective actions needed.   The contractor advised that they observed two small areas with approximate sizes of five (5) to (7) seven inches in diameter had dripped onto the asphalt roadway.   These areas were abated by the application of Portland cement compound as an absorbent by the contractor.  The contractor also discovered an open ended fitting next to the dome area that was not tight.  The contractor corrected the situation and wiped up some of the free liquid in the Lading System.  The Contractor believes that the extremely cold temperatures caused the lading System drains to freeze which then prevented the liquid from escaping the Lading System.  With the tanker trailer situation corrected, the truck was sent to the facility for off-loading and then directed  to truck wash for final  cleanup of the dried waste material.","Corrective Actions taken is the establishment of a tanker trailer check sheet as well as additional training for prevention of this type of occurrence  are;  · Loading personnel are to double check all seals and valves to confirm that they are secure and tight before allowing the tanker to leave  the work area;  · Anytime the truck stops at a location before arriving at the destination, double check all seals and valves for leakage.  · Document all of the activities that were performed.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Tradebe Transportation,US,

The next morning 1-6-16, the material handler opened trailer 18703 and smelled Bleach or Sodium Hypochlorite. The MH then went to the side of the trailer and noticed that there was something leaking from the nose of the trailer on the ground. The MH immediately notified the BOM and BOS of what he found. Initial inspection revealed that one of the totes was leaking from a defective ball valve. Most of the product that leaked was still on the floor of the trailer other than a 4x4 puddle on the ground. BOM notified tank farm employees and clean up ensued. The material was cleaned up without further incident.",During daily STAR meeting we trained employees on checking ball valves prior to shipment.

Upon further examination the car was found to be leaking from the area of the manway lid.  BNSF hazmat responders investigated and found the vacuum relief valve (VRV) which was affixed to the manway lid to be leaking.  They opened the manway to inspect the underside of the valve and found the sealing o-ring at the base of the valve had rolled out of position.  BNSF hazmat responders removed the VRV and disassembled.  The existing gasket was moved back into its proper place and the valve was re-applied to the car.  While the manway was opened, responders replaced the manway gasket even though there was no evidence of a leak from that location.  During this process the car was in a departing train heading for Bakersfield.  The car departed and arrived Bakersfield, CA without further release.  MP Environmental contractor was called to the car in Bakersfield to remove the repaired VRV and apply a suitable pipe plug in it's place.  Shipper was notified and applied for OTMA-3 from FRA.  Total release was estimated at 3 ounces and was confined to the top of the tank car.  No impact to the environment occurred.",Shipper should initiate a process in their pre-trip inspection to account for the possibility of a failing VRV by applying minimum pressure to detect a leak from any fixture which would include the VRV.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The trailer was being moved from Tradebe Transportation LLC Marport 10-day facility.  When the trailer was opened at the East Chicago facility the container was found to have tipped over and the lid was misaligned.    When the driver reached over and set the bucket up straight he noticed several balls of mercury were on the trailer floor.  After discovery, he reported the spillage and was instructed to prepare the trailer for the cleanup crew.  Tradebe personnel conducted the incident response and mercury recovery.   Inspection of the trailer floor and the material recovered indicates no releases from the trailer and that the small spill was confined to inside the trailer.  The Tradebe investigation indicates that the small container had fallen off a skid and onto the floor, jarring the lid off.  There is a question as to if the original shipper of the waste applied the lid correctly since Tradebe had not opened the container.","Recommendations,    1.

A State Trooper saw him and stopped to make sure the driver was not having a problem.  During the conversation it was observed that the tank was sweating.  Upon further inspection, the leveler gauge on the cargo tank was discovered to be leaking - approximately one drip for every 3 minutes.  The driver contained the leak by hanging an empty 5 gallon bucket on the level indicator while the local Veolia office sent out an empty CTMV to which the load was then transferred.  The emptied CTMV that was leaking proceeded to the local Fleetpride service shop for repairs.","Veolia drivers currently double check all gauges, valves and connections for leaks prior to transportation.

The driver immediately pulled over and evaluated the situation.   The driver observed drips coming from midpoint of the trailer on the passenger side.  The driver exited the busy highway and parked away from the highway on an asphalt surface.  The driver then placed a spill kit drum under the trailer where he observed drips seeping through the floor.  Next, the driver placed absorbent media around the recovery drum and under the trailer.  As an additional precaution, the driver set an absorbent boom under the trailer and along the edge of the asphalt pavement.  The driver applied absorbent inside the trailer between drums sitting on the trailer floor.  Tradebe office personnel notified the local agencies of the incident and then Tradebe personnel dispatched a private response contractor to conduct incident response.  The local agencies went to the site and conducted area surveillance.  The local agencies cleared the area and allowed the Tradebe contractor to perform the site response activities on the trailer and asphalt surface under the trailer.    The response contractor solidified the remaining material liquid in the metal drum; solidified the liquid in the spill collection drum with the absorbent swept up from the asphalt drive surface and then inspected the trailer to confirm success of their response activities.  Tradebe advised the state agency of the incident and response activities conducted by the contractor.

The driver turned off the pump and closed the unloading line valves, which stopped the release. The package failure was determined to be caused by an unlined or coated stainless steel fitting which was incompatible with the lading. Two one-inch diameter holes were observed on the fitting collar. The fitting was replaced with a corrosive resistant plastic fitting. The duration of the release is estimated to have been 5-10 minutes. We dispatched an emergency response contractor to clean up the release.

The incident was reported to Chemtrec and the shipper was notified.    The shipper responded to secure the package. The KCS Environmental + Hazmat Department was updated by their responder and learned there were actually two points of release. The first point of release, and largest by volume, was a crack in the vaporizer coil. The vaporizer coil is located under the rail car, in between the two valve cabinets. The vaporizer is normally isolated without lading in the transportation mode. The release to the defective (cracked) vaporizer was caused by the Pressure Build Inlet Valve (V-3) being left in the open position by the offeror. Also, a second release was discovered from a loose valve packing on the Pressure Build Inlet Valve (V-3). The shipper responded to the incident and mitigated the release by closing the Pressure Build Inlet Valve and tightening the loose packing.      The crack in the vaporizer caused the package to be off specification and non-compliant per FRA. KCS Environmental + Hazmat spoke with FRA, Washington, DC, Kevin Blackwell and he authorized the movement of this off spec package back to origin in Nerderland, Texas, per 49CFR174.50, for repair or unloading before further transportation to home-shop under a One Time Movement Approval-3 secured by shipper.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

NORTH LAKE and COKEENERGY share the same street address but different mail code locations.  The driver began to unload the sulfuric acid only to overflow the COKEENERGY tank and product has spilled on the ground.             Investigation recap:   •  Cokenergy and North Lake Energy share the same street address  • The driver had never been to North Lake Energy before, but had been to Cokenergy before  • As the Driver approached the delivery location, he made an assumption that Cokenergy had changed its name to Northlake.  • The driver went into the receiving trailer and gave his paperwork to the receiver. He went over the shipping papers (BOL  and the delivery form) and asked her if they had room for the load.  She signed off on both pieces of paperwork   • The driver did not verify or ask if the name of the company changed  • The driver parked next to tank at the unloading site and proceeded to prep for delivery by verifying the tank label, and checking out the safety shower.    • He then suited up into his PPE, hooked up the line, and proceeded to unload.   o Interviewing several other drivers that have been to this location, there is typically not a supervisor to witness or give additional approval to begin loading (other than the receiver that signs the paperwork).   • After 35-45 minutes of unloading, the tank started to overflow and the driver conducted an emergency shut down.  o  The shutdown was completed in ~20 seconds and over flow stopped in about 30 seconds.  • The driver then reported it to receiver.  o She called a supervisor to come out.  • Then a Supervisor came out and looked at the spill, told the driver that he was at the wrong location  and that SET (the emergency response team)was going to be coming out to clean it up.  • A couple of more guys came over and put caution tape around the tank and spill area.  • The driver then measured the amount of product left in the trailer and went into the receiver (Nancy) to correct the quantity delivered on the BOL, and let her know was ready to leave  • The driver then left and claimed he was not told not to leave which differs from the customer’s comments).",• Driver will be retrained on verifying that he is at the correct customer  • Safety Stand down will be held with the Plain-field team reviewing the incident and importance of reading and following all paperwork  • Work with customer to create Bulk Site Profiles  • Work with customer with the ask the train their employees how to properly verify what the current level of product in the tank is (to prevent overflows,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10500,"Univar USA, Inc.",US,

No leaked product reached the ground.  The protective housing cover on top of the tank car was not properly secured.,"FRA inspector placed the securement hook into the housing cover retainer link and installed a security seal at the time of the discovery.  On Feb. 1, 2016, shipper dispatched personnel to the tank car.  They found that the doom gasket seemed to be the cause of the leak.

THE DRIVER WAS PROCEEDING TO HIS FIRST DELIVERY OF THE DAY, AND HAD 886 GALLONS OF #2 DYED DIESEL REMAINING ONBOARD. THE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND WERE CLEAR; THERE HAD BEEN A SNOWFALL RECENTLY, HOWEVER THE ROADWAY UPON WHICH THE DRIVER WAS PROCEEDING WAS DRY.     AS THE DRIVER PROCEEDED THROUGH THE LONG CURVE OF THE ON-RAMP, HE STATED THAT HE HEARD A LOUD MECHANICAL NOISE WHILE SITTING IN THE CAB OF HIS UNIT BEFORE THE UNIT SUDDENLY VEERED TO THE LEFT. THE UNIT IMMEDIATELY STRUCK THE GUARD RAIL ON THE DRIVER’S SIDE. THE DRIVER ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT, BUT THE UNIT STRUCK A SECTION OF THE GUARD RAIL AND FLIPPED THE UNIT. AS THE UNIT BEGAN ITS FIRST ROLL, THE REMAINS OF THE GUARD RAIL SECTION AFFECTED HOOKED ONTO THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAB AND RIPPED THE DOOR FROM THE CAB’S FRAME. THE UNIT LANDED UPSIDE DOWN, NOSE FIRST INTO THE ROADWAY AND WAS PROPELLED FORWARD BEFORE IT CAME TO A REST ON THE DRIVER’S SIDE. THE LINES LEADING DIRECTLY FROM THE BARREL TO THE LOAD HEADS WERE DAMAGED AND AN ESTIMATED EIGHT GALLONS OF PRODUCT LEAKED OUT. THE BARREL SEALS WERE ALSO COMPROMISED ON TOP OF THE UNIT. HOWEVER THE INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT LESS THAN A QUARTER GALLON ESCAPED BEFORE THE UNIT WAS RIGHTED.     THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED WITHIN TEN MINUTES. HOWEVER, THE DRIVER WAS TAKEN FROM THE SCENE BY AMBULANCE, AND COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES WERE NOT CONTACTED UNTIL AFTER THE UNIT HAD BEEN RIGHTED, APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR LATER. THE UNIT WAS TOWED FROM THE SCENE TO A LOCAL TOW YARD. THE INITIAL REPORT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND THE OHIO EPA OFFICE WERE ERRONEOUS; MORE THAN THIRTY GALLONS WERE INITIALLY BELIEVED TO HAVE LEAKED OUT. DURING THE COMPANY’S INVESTIGATION, THE INVENTORY TAKEN FROM WHAT WAS PUMPED OFF OF THE AFFECTED UNIT COMPARED TO WHAT HAD BEEN ONBOARD FROM THE PREVIOUS EVENING REVEALED A DISCREPANCY OF ONLY EIGHT (8) GALLONS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BROUGHT IN ENVIRONMENTAL ENTERPRISES, INC. TO CLEAR THE ROADWAY OF RESIDUAL PRODUCT. THE REMAINING 878 GALLONS WERE RECOVERED FROM THE UNIT.","LYKINS OIL COMPANY REVIEWS ALL INCIDENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT SUCH INCIDENTS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED OR OTHERWISE PREVENTED.

THE PUP TANKER CAME TO REST ON ITS SIDE TO AN APPROXIMATE 85 DEGREE ROLLOVER. THE PPV (POSITIVE PRESSURE VACUUM) VENT LOCATED INTERNALLY ON THE TOP OF THE TANKER WAS DISCOVERED TO BE IN AN OPEN POSITION, AND AS IT WAS BELOW THE GASOLINE LEVEL IN THE TANKER, IT LEAKED GASOLINE. IT WASN'T A GUSHING LEAK, MORE LIKE JUST A TRICKLE. BEING SUBMERGED, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MANUALLY CLOSE THE VENT. SAND WAS PUT DOWN ON THE ROADWAY WHICH WAS SLOPED DOWN AND AWAY FROM AN WATER BODIES. THE SAND CAUGHT MOST OF THE FUEL AND FINALLY AN NRC ENGINEER PUT A 40 GALLON CAN UNDER THE LEAKING VENT. THE CLEANUP AND UNLOADING OF THE TANKER TOOK ABOUT 8 HOURS. SOIL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN BY WASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGY IN THE AREA AND NO FURTHER REMEDIATION IS REQUIRED.","WE ARE CHANGING OUR MAINTENANCE POLICY ON THIS PARTICULAR STYLE OF VENT. IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE VENTS ARE ONLY REPLACED WHEN THEY FAIL DURING ANNUAL TESTING PERFORMED BY A CERTIFIED TESTING FIRM. WE ARE GOING TO REPLACED THESE VENTS EVERY TWO YEARS REGARDLESS OF IF THEY PASS THE ANNUAL PRESSURE AND VACUUM TEST. SINCE THE VENT PASSED THE ANNUAL TEST IN MAY 2015 THEN LEAKED 8 MONTHS LATER AT 4 YEARS OF AGE, WE BELIEVE BIANNUAL REPLACEMENT OF THE VENT WILL IMPROVED THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE VENT PREFORMING CORRECTLY. THERE ARE AS MANY AS 6 OF THESE VENTS ON EACH TANKER UNIT. AT THIS TIME THESE VENTS COST $55 EACH.
