Based on further inspection of the bushings it appeared that a fluid level guage was leaking. The material leaking from the bushing was PCB contaminated (83 ppm) mineral oil. The spilled material covered an area within the concrete containment area of 1.5 feet by 12 feet. Assuming the liquid was less than an 0.125 inches thick, the volume of liquid spilled was ~1.5 gallons. Based on the concentration of PCB this amounted to 0.000988 lb. of PCB, well below the RQ for PCB. Following discovery, the spill was reported to the shift supervisor and clean up operations were started immediately. The spill was cleaned up using the double wash double rinse procedure defined in 40 CFR 761. Clean up debris was added to the manifest for shipment to a permitted facility for disposal.","The transport and disposal of electrical equipment such as transformers and bushings present a number of challenges.

We discovered a piece of steel had pushed up against a tote. When we moved the steel the tote began to leak. We got the tote lowered over a recovery drum to catch the leak. This lasted about 20 Minutes collected approximately 8 gallons. The tote sealed itself and quit leaking. We drained the remaining material into a new tote supplied by the consignee. We shipped the new tote and the damaged tote to the consignee. The recovery drum with the 8 gallons is scheduled to be removed by a environmental recovery company for disposal.,Better loading techniques training at all breakbulk terminals.

HWY 99,STOCKTON,CA,95215,Carrier,"The dockworker began unloading the trailer. As he was pulling pallets out of the trailer and went back to get another, he noticed that the next pallet had HMs on it. As he checked the pallet out before picking it up, he noticed that the HM label on one of the cartons at the bottom of the pallet was very faded. When he checked it out, he found that the carton had a hole in it, looked like a puncture from a forklift blade, and the carton was slightly wet. He notified the supervisor. They carefully removed it from the pallet and opened it up. The top of the can was crushed and the lid popped off. About 1/2 of the gallon can was missing, however there was no liquid on the floor of the trailer. There were no signs of a spill, except that the carton was slightly wet.We put the can in a recovery drum and held it in STK OS&D for disposition.","It is our suggestion that pallets or plywood be placed in between HMs when loading them on a trailer. This would help protect the HMs on the pallet when the next pallet is loaded into the trailer. Should the forklift driver have the forks to high, or the blades extend beyond the pallet he would hit the pallet or plywood and stop , before causing any damage to the HMs.      We held a dock meeting to review the incident and praised the dock worker for his appropriate actions. He noticed the pallet had hms on it and before picking it up he checked the pallet out. He wanted to make sure that the pallet was intact, and that nothing would fall off the back when he picked it up. When he noticed the faded label and found that it was wet, he went and notified the supervisor. Although it is difficult to determine where the incident occurred, the crew agreed that the best way to prevent this would be to surround all HMs shipments with pallets or plywood.",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,83,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,FEDEX FREIGHT EAST,US,

When the loader was venting he noticed the hose was not depressuring.  Venting the hose typically takes 15 - 20 seconds. LPG product was going to the atmosphere for this period of time.     The event was mitigated by closing an upstream valve to isolate the system.    Liquid hose was then vented and disconnected.,"Trained all truck drivers on the procedures at our loading rack to ensure compliance.

There is an indentation in the box indicative of being struck by a forklift tine. One 1 gallon jug of product was struck and it leaked in transit. All of the spilled product had evaporated by the time it had arrived in Spokane. Upon discovery in Spokane, the trailer was abandoned until our safety department was contacted along with the shipper emergency contact. A Conway Safety Manager was contacted first and he advised that I needed to call the emergency number listed on the BOL. Chemtrec took the report information and it is filed under report number 12202006064. He called the shipper contact which in turn called me to access the situation. MARCOR advised that we could clean the spilled product as long as we wore rubber gloves. I donned the gloves and found 1- 1 gallon jug to be empty. I removed the other jugs in the carton and recoupled them into clean boxes, properly labelled them and sent them to destination.",Ensure proper dunnaging of HM shipments during the loading process.

During transit the plastic pallet must have flexed causing the bands that were securing the battery to the pallet to break. There was no way to resecure the battery to the pallet without moving it first. When the material handler went to move it with the forklift the battery slid off of the pallet and fell to its side causing the unintentional release through one of the battery caps.

GRANDVIEW BLVD.,WAUKESHA,WI,53188,Other-MIKE BERNARDO-GE HEALTHC,"The incident at issue involved the receipt of an undeclared shipment of a radioactive material by GE Healthcare (GEHC) at its GoldSeal facility in Waukesha WI. This shipment unexpectedly occurred in connection with a return by Cardiosonix Laboratories (“Cardiosonix”) of separate, leased GE imaging equipment. The material at issue consisted of two Cs-137 solid sources registered to Cardiosonix. The sources were secured in a shielded container at all relevant times and there was no release.     Cardiosonix had leased a GE Functional(“Imaging System”), which contains no radioactive materials, from GE Healthcare Financial Services   (HFS). Cardiosonix subsequently defaulted on its lease. Cardiosonix or its agents thereafter packed the components of the Imaging System into several boxes, deposited them at a Public Storage facility in Hialeah, FL. and advised HFS of their whereabouts in October 2006.     HFS then contacted GEHC to arrange for transportation, and GEHC hired United Van Lines to transport the closed boxes from the Florida storage facility to GEHC’s GoldSeal’s facility in Waukesha, WI. HFS subsequently sold the returned equipment to GEHC.     On December 12, 2006 at approximately 12:00 pm, the Cardiosonix shipping boxes arrived on the dock of GE GoldSeal Global Services Facility. During the receiving and inspection process, GE technicians found within one of the boxes, amidst other equipment (cables, etc.), a closed lead container with a Radioactive Materials label on it. Upon discovery, the technicians immediately obtained a survey meter and checked for radiation levels from the box containing the material. It was determined that the materials were Cs- 137 sealed sources with readings measuring approximately 7 microrem above background.     Site Radiation Safety Officer was contacted for further inspection. Site RSO placed the container to a shielded area for inspection. Leak tests were performed on the lead box, the container for the poly bottle, the poly bottle and the rod source of Cs-l37. Results showed that the sources were intact. GEHC EHS was immediately notified. GEHC EHS review confirmed that the material is not exempt from transportation regulations.     GEHC had no reason to believe that these Cs-137 sources were being shipped as part of the Cardiosonix equipment return, as the Imaging System at issue does not contain any radioactive sources. Thus, no sources should have been included by Cardiosonix in its equipment return.     As part of the investigation GEHC made numerous attempts to contact Cardiosonix, who remains the owner of record of the sources at issue. Cardiosonix could not be reached. GEHC subsequently returned the Cardiosonix sealed sources to the manufacturer in accordance with all applicable DOT/NRC requirements.",GE to further review its equipment return process to analyze what additional measures it could implement to minimize the chance of similar incidents occurring in the future.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,GOLDSEAL-GE HEALTHCARE,US,

The station was closed at the time of the delivery.  There are alarms on the station and they were working at the time of the spill.  The problem with the high limit alarms are that they only sound inside of the station and cannot be heard outside where the driver was making the delivery. The 10% safe fill devices in the fills were not working at all at the time of the spill.    Two sewers were affected and Milro Associates were called in for the clean up of the incident.,The high limit alarms should be heard outside of the building if the station is going to take deliveries when the station is closed.

TWO RAIL CARS WERE IN POSITION AT THE DOCK, ONE AT THE NORTH RACK AND ONE AT THE SOUTH RACK. SPENT ACID FROM BOTH CARS HAD BEEN OFF LOADED BY 4:22 AM. AFTER RETURNING FROM “LUNCH” THE OPERATOR BEGAN PREPARATION TO LOAD FRESH ACID INTO THE CAR AT THE SOUTH RACK. THE OPERATOR OPENED THE GATE VALVE ON THE ACID LINE TO THE CAR AT THE SOUTH RACK, SET HIS BATCH METER FOR 12,750 GALLONS, STARTED THE SOUTH ACID PUMP, AND AT 5:12 STARTED LOADING THE CAR WITH 99% ACID AT THE SOUTH RACK. HE THEN DID THE SAME THING AT THE NORTH RACK, SET HIS BATCH METER AND STARTED THE NORTH ACID PUMP TO FILL THE CAR. THE CAR AT THE SOUTH RACK, SHPX206777, HAS A LISTED STORAGE CAPACITY OF 13,140 GALLONS. AT 5:42:57 AM FRESH ACID STARTED TO OVERFLOW FROM THE CAR AT THE SOUTH RACK. THE OPERATOR REACTED AND BY 5:43:23 AM HAD SHUT DOWN THE FILLING OPERATION BY HITTING THE EMERGENCY STOP AT THE SOUTH RACK. THIS SHUT DOWN THE SOUTH PUMP AND CLOSED THE AIR OPERATED VALVE IN THE ACID LINE FEEDING THE SOUTH RACK. AFTER STOPPING THE ACID OVERFLOW AT THE SOUTH RACK THE OPERATOR WENT TO INSPECT THE CAR AT THE NORTH RACK. HE FOUND THAT HE HAD FAILED TO OPEN THE MANUAL GATE VALVE ON THE ACID FEED LINE TO THE TANK CAR SO NO ACID HAD ENTERED THE CAR. HE THEN WENT BACK AND SHUT DOWN THE NORTH ACID FEED PUMP AND AIR OPERATED VALVE. THE OPERATOR THEN WENT TO GET A PALLET OF SODA ASH TO NEUTRALIZE THE SPILLED ACID. THE MAJORITY OF THE SPILL WAS CONTAINED AT THE RAIL DOCK. AFTER DAYLIGHT, A SMALL AMOUNT OF ACID(10-15 GALLONS) WAS OBSERVED THROUGH THE CHAIN LINK FENCE ON BP’S PROPERTY WHICH WE ATTEMPTED TO NEUTRALIZE WITH SODA ASH.     REVIEW OF THE TAPE FROM THE RAIL DOCK CAMERA(S) WAS COMPLETED BY 9:00 AM. IT WAS THEN DETERMINED BASED ON THE TIME OF ACTUAL DISCHARGE AND APPROXIMATE FLOW THAT WE HAD EXCEEDED THE RQ FOR SULFURIC ACID. THE NRC WAS CONTACTED AT 9:08 AM FOLLOWED BY THE SERC AND LEPC. BP WAS CONTACTED AT THE SAME TIME AND INFORMED THAT A MINOR AMOUNT OF ACID WAS ON THEIR PROPERTY. THEY WERE ADVISED TO HAVE THEIR CONTRACTOR CLEAN UP THE SMALL SPILL AND BILL US FOR THE EXPENSE. EQ INDUSTRIAL SERVICES WAS CALLED IN FOR CLEAN UP SERVICES. A VAC TRUCK WAS USED TO COLLECT ACID FROM THE RAIL DOCK SUMP AS WELL AS FROM AREAS THAT COULD BE REACHED THROUGH THE FENCE ON THE BP SITE. CONTAMINATED SOIL WITH SODA ASH WAS REMOVED FROM A 150 FT. AREA AT THE RAIL DOCK. ALL LIQUID, STONE AND SOIL THAT WAS REMOVED FROM THE RAIL DOCK WAS PLACED IN THE DECONTAMINATION PIT FOR FURTHER WASHING AND NEUTRALIZATION. ALL WASTEWATER FROM THE DECONTAMINATION PIT DISCHARGES TO THE BP WASTE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM. EQ WAS FINISHED WITH CLEANUP OPERATIONS BY 3:00 PM.     BY FAILING TO OPEN THE VALVE TO THE RAILCAR AT THE NORTH RACK, THE OPERATOR WAS USING TWO PUMPS TO FILL THE RAILCAR AT THE SOUTH RACK. THESE PUMP DISCHARGES SHARE A COMMON 6” LINE UP TO THE RAIL DOCK WHERE IT SPLITS INTO TWO SEPARATE FEED LINES, ONE TO THE NORTH RACK, ONE TO THE SOUTH RICK. IT",THE EMPLOYEE HAS GONE THROUGH 2 DAYS OF RETRAINING ON RAILCAR ACID LOADING PROCEDURES.

The back rear passenger side tire on the tire collided with the median curb and the load shifted. The driver lost control of the transportation unit and rolled it onto its passenger side, colliding with a railroad crossing device. The collision resulted in the tearing of the tanker, causing approximately 4450 gallons of diesel fuel to escape onto the road surface and adjacent Union Pacific Railroad property.     The Aurora Police, Fire and HAZMAT departments responded to the scene. Fire and HAZMAT immediately placed absorbents and diking devices around the vehicle. Fuel entered the storm drain and contaminated the adjacent property. Flying J immediately notified their corporate response contractor and a crew immediately responded to the location. Remaining fuel in the tanker was removed, and major site remediation efforts began. Storm drain was cleaned of fuel and excavation efforts began on the contaminated soil surfaces.

This intermodal flatcar was set-out of the train for interior inspection of OOLU 576397. A BNSF contractor inspected OOLU 576397 and found two 55 gallon steel drums partially crushed by heavy lading (a 4500 lb. piece of equipment on a skid) that was stacked atop these drums with no layer separation. Poor blocking and bracing inside OOLU 576397 prevented a load shift that caused this heavy item atop the drums to move and the shifted weight partially crushed the sidewalls of the two drums below. The sidewall crushing resulted in small cracks in the sidewall and product leakage. The two leaking drums were placed into over-packs and returned inside OOLU 56397 after the spillage inside this container was wiped.

DRIVER REPORTS FEELING HIS RIGHT FRONT TRACTOR STEER TIRE LEAVE THE PAVEMENT; THAT HE AT FIRST ATTEMPTED TO ""RIDE"" THE PUSH TO THE RIGHT AS UNIT WAS LEAVING THE ROADWAY PAVEMENT INTO THE GRASSY DOWNWARD SLOPED BERM AND THAT HE THEN ATTEMPTED TO STEER BACK ONTO ROADWAY AND FELT THE TRAILER ""PUSHING"" HIM FIRST FROM THE RIGHT AND THEN TO THE LEFT (APPARENTLY AS THE UNIT ROLLED OVER). TWO EVERGREEN TYPE TREES, APPROX 30’ TALL, WERE STRUCK BY THE TRANSPORT UNIT AND ACTED AS A ""STOPPING FORCE"" TO SLOW DOWN AND STOP THE FORWARD PROGRESSION OF THE UNIT. THE TRANSPORT UNIT CAME TO REST, ABREAST OF THE NOTED TREES, WITH BOTH THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER (TRANSPORT UNIT) LYING ON THEIR RESPECTIVE DRIVERS SIDES. DRIVER WAS ASSISTED FROM THE DAMAGED TRACTOR BY HELP OF A RESIDENT FROM ACROSS THE STREET FROM WHERE THE TRANSPORT UNIT LEFT THE ROADWAY. APPROPRIATE CALLS WERE PLACED FROM THE SCENE TO 911 EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND COMPANY PERSONNEL CONTACT. COMPANY PERSONNEL RESPONDED WITH CALL/REPORTS TO THE INDIANA EPA (INCIDENT #2006-12-137), THE DEARBORN COUNTY LEPC, DEARBORN COUNTY SHERIFF DEPARTMENT AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE. THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT CONTACTED AND HAD THE GREATER CINCINNATI HAZARDOUS MATERIALS, INC. UNIT RESPOND.     AS TRANSPORT WAS LOADED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE SITE WAS SPRAYED WITH FOAM MATERIAL AS PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AND TO CONTROL ANY POTENTIAL SITUATIONS ASSOCIATED TO THE GASOLINE PRODUCT THAT WAS LOADED ON THE TRANSPORT. IT WAS FOUND THAT A HOUSING FOR THE PRODUCT LEVEL SENSOR OF COMPARTMENT NUMBER 2 OF THE TRAILER WAS LEAKING/SEEPING GASOLINE FROM THE INTERNAL GASKET AREA WHERE THE HOUSING MEETS THE TOP OF THE TRAILER. FROM THE IMPACT THAT THE TRANSPORT UNIT SUSTAINED IN THE ROLLOVER IT WAS, TO OUR IMPRESSION, QUITE AMAZING THAT THE ONLY FORM OF LEAKAGE FROM THE VESSEL WAS OF THIS NATURE. THE ACTUAL ALUMINUM TANK TRAILER VESSEL PORTION, MAN WAYS, ETC. ALL MAINTAINED THEIR INTEGRITY; WITH AS NOTED ABOVE THE SOURCE OF A SEEPAGE OF PRODUCT COMING FROM THE NOTED MECHANISM.    RESPONDERS PLACED SOP PADS BENEATH THIS AREA TO ASSIST IN ABSORPTION OF THE GASOLINE AS IT VACATED THE TRAILER UNIT, (IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED THAT APPROX. 15 GALLONS OF GASOLINE LEAKED/SEEPED OUT OF THIS APPARATUS). AFTER THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS SECURED THE AREA, COMPANY PERSONNEL DRILLED HOLES INTO THE FOUR TRAILER COMPARTMENTS GOING THROUGH THE ACTUAL PASSENGER SIDE OF THE TRAILER THAT WAS POINTING TOWARD THE SKY AS A RESULT OF THE ROLLOVER. RECLAIMED PRODUCT WAS THEN PUMPED OUT OF THE WRECKED TRAILER ONTO A SECOND TRAILER THAT WAS BROUGHT TO THE SCENE BY THE COMPANY. A PTO (POWER TAKE OFF) PUMP ON THE SECOND TRANSPORT TRACTOR WAS USED TO PUMP OUT THE PRODUCT FROM THE WRECKED TRAILER. AN ALUMINUM PUMP OUT TUBE WAS CONNECTED FROM THE SECOND (PUMPING TRANSPORT) INTO THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED HOLES THAT WERE DRILLED INTO THE SIDE OF THE OVERTURNED TRAILE","OF NOTE PREVIOUSLY IN THIS REPORT; WE WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE OVERALL INTEGRITY OF THE HEIL TRAILER AND THE COMPONENT STRUCTURE IN REGARDS TO THIS ROLLOVER ACCIDENT. WE FEEL FORTUNATE THAT THE ROLLOVER AND IMPACT OF THE VEHICLE WHILE DOING SO RESULTED IN ONLY A SMALL SEEPAGE OF PRODUCT FROM A GASKET AREA FOR THE MOUNTING OF THE SENSOR BODY. THE ""PACKAGING"" IN THIS CASE WAS SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW THE MINIMAL EXPOSURE TO PRODUCT SPILLAGE AND LOSS.     FROM AN OPERATIONAL AND ENTWINED SAFETY PERSPECTIVE WE DO HOLD QUARTERLY SAFETY MEETINGS AND REVIEW A VARIETY OF DRIVING AND ROADWAY CONCERNS WITH OUR WORK FORCE. ALL DRIVER PERSONNEL ARE INSTRUCTED IN PROPER LOADING, UNLOADING, DRIVING AND ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES. DRIVERS ARE RE-TRAINED IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA WHEN ENGAGED IN AN INCIDENT THAT WARRANTS THAT APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.     THIS PARTICULAR ACCIDENT OCCURRED IN A SLOPPING GRADUAL CURVE TO THE LEFT ON A TWO LANE COUNTY ROADWAY. THE NATURAL INCLINATION IS FOR THE DRIVER, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN HIS UNIT IN THE PROPER LANE, WOULD HUG THE SHOULDER A BIT TO MAINTAIN THE TRAILER IN THE LANE OF TRAVEL. IN THIS INCIDENT THE DRIVER PLACED HIS VEHICLE TOO CLOSE TO THE SHOULDER OF THE PAVEMENT AND RESULTED WITH THE TRUCK EXITING THE ROADWAY. THESE TYPES OF RURAL ROADWAYS ARE VERY COMMON AND IT IS A CONTINUING EFFORT TO ADVISE OUR DRIVERS TO MAINTAIN PROPER POSITIONING OF THEIR UNITS AT ALL TIME. THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT AND WILL BE SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION IN OUR NEXT QUARTERLY DRIVER SAFETY MEETINGS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 TO REINFORCE THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THIS TYPE OF ACCIDENT AND HOW TO WORK TOWARD AVOIDANCE OF SAME.     FROM A REGULATORY STANDPOINT THE SITUATION WAS RESOLVED IN A POSITIVE MANNER.
