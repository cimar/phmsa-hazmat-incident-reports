I immediately called a transloading contractor, Rail Loading Services, who was already on property working for Centennial Energy to go look at the car.  He called me back and informed me that the Liquid valve on the A end of the car was leaking.  As he investigated, he found that both the liquid valve plugs and the vapor valve plug was loose along with the sample line plug.  He tried to tighten the valve handle on the leaking liquid valve but the leak would not stop.  He put Teflon Tape on the valve plug and then installed the plug and tightened it, and then the leak stopped. He also installed tape on the other plugs and tightened them.

At the time of this report, no drains, soils or waterways were reported as being impacted. The caller stated the release was visible when the trailer was received to be offloaded from the FON terminal and apparently was due to alack of blocking and bracing resulting in the release.

Approximately 63 gallons of UN1791 Sodium Hypochlorite was determined to be released as the result of the tanker dome-lid not being sufficiently secured during pressurization for unloading. The released product migrated into a nearby waterway that was confirmed to lead into the Galveston Bay. USES responded out of Texas City, TX to contain and clean the released product. A 150 ft. section of the waterway was boomed off and contained. The Coast Guard had also responded to the site once it was confirmed that the material had reached the waterway. Per their instruction, USES removed approximately 4,000 gallons of bleach-impacted waters for pending disposal in a frac tank on-site. Additionally, approximately 10 yards of solid waste was generated for pending disposal from the impacted soils.

The origin of the shipment was TOXCO Materials Management Center in Oak Ridge, TN for WMG, Inc. (TOXCO shipment #X140928)  The carrier was Interstate Ventures/Visionary.  Upon receipt inspection, it was noticed that one of the containers exhibited damage consisting of an approximately 7"" ""tear"" in the metal wall near the floor-wall junction.  Radiological surveillance around the tear exhibited removable surface contamination in the amount of 12,000 dpm/100cm^2 beta-gamma.  The area on the container was decontaminated by wiping, container sealed with caulking, and moved to storage.  After removing the container from the trailer, the trailer was surveyed for contamination.  Two discrete areas of beta-gamma contamination measuring 20,000 cpm/probe and 2,000 cpm/probe (Ludlum Model 12A with a 16cm^2 pancake probe @ 10% efficiency) were identified on the trailer in the area directly below where the tear in the container was.  These discrete areas of contamination were captured with duct tape and moved to a radioactive waste disposal container.  In this same location, an area of contamination in the amount of 300-400 cpm/probe was found embedded in the wood of the trailer deck. The trailer was moved to controlled area, decontaminated by chiseling out the contamination, surveyed for unrestricted use in accordance with our procedural and license conditions, and released back to the carrier.","Veolia/Alaron is submitting this report as the receiving facility.

GATX 57444 was cordoned-off. Response contractors arrived and inspected GATX 57444. The four flange bolts applied on the vapor line riser connection (below the T-piping assembly that held a horizontal vapor valve and a vertical ruptured disc assembly) appeared tight but allowed vapor to escape at this flange connection. Responder's loosened all flange bolt nuts and then tightened them to eliminate the vent at the flange connection. This process was repeated until the flange connection was fully seated, sealed and the venting ceased.  Ambient humidity resulted in vapor formed liquid droplets adhering to the valve housing area and on the security bag. The security bag was contaminated and earmarked for disposal. Corrosive material adhering on GATX 57444 was neutralized and wiped.

After traveling about 300 miles, our driver stopped at a Truck stop and noticed HazMat on the sides of the CTMV.  Our driver found an open front washout port.  A cleanup contractor was dispatched clean up the release.  Since the contractor noticed minimal HazMat on the route to the truck stop, and the release stopped when the CTMV was parked, the release duration is estimated to be tens of minutes.

One of Blick's employees drug a hose on the ground which had a valve attached to the end. The dragging of the hose caused the valve to open and release anhydrous ammonia. 7 tons or 14,000 lbs. of NH3 escaped before the valve was able to be closed. 12 houses were evacuated with 3 people at home at the time. Once the release was stopped, the homeowners were allowed to return to their homes.  No injuries resulted as a result of this release. MN state highway 251 was closed for approximately 2 hours as well. CHS Transportation was not the RP in this incident as we were delivering the product and had just pulled in to unload.

On 12/11/2014, GAMX 9740 was reported venting in the railyard. The initial responder inspecting GAMX 9740 reported finding ice accumulating on its vapor valve. The vapor valve was found partially open with its closure plug not tool tight. The responder closed the vapor valve and tool tightened its closure plug which ended the vapor release from the vapor valve assembly. Afterwards, contract responders re-inspected GAMX 9740 and reported observing intermittent vapor releases from GAMX 9740's pressure plate connection and its 300 psig reclosing pressure relief valve (PRV) which indicated that internal pressure within GAMX 9740 was increasing. GAMX 9740 was isolated in railyard for commodity reduction and was continuously monitored. On 12/12/2014, a portion of the commodity within GAMX 9740 was transferred into a tanker truck without incident by 1600 hrs. CST.  Afterwards the internal pressure within GAMX 9740 dropped from 289 psi to 60 psi ending any further venting or vapor releases. Eight pressure plate mounting bolts at the previous intermittent vent location were tool tightened 1/2 turn each. It was also noted that GAMX 9740's magnetic gaging device was not functioning properly as it was portraying inaccurate commodity levels.     Qualification stenciling on GAMX 9740 indicated GAMX 9740's last tank qualification date was in year 2012 and PRD qualification in year 2014.","Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings, including appropriate commodity outage and filling limits.",No,TANK CAR,,112J400W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, Renewable Products Marketing were notified via CHEMTREC report number 2014-1231-00138.  SWS Environmental, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the cause of the release was due to a deteriorated bottom outlet cap gasket.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to Renewable Products representative Kevin Brim at 952-465-3220. Contractor personnel replaced the bottom outlet cap gasket and properly tightened the secondary closure.  The leak was secured and the car released for transport.

On December 3, 2014, a leak was observed coming from a roll-off container holding solid hazardous waste material. The roll-off container was moved from the ground and positioned on top of plastic on a concrete slab. Catch pans were placed beneath the container along with absorbent material to collect the leaking material. The leak was stopped/contained approximately 30 minutes after the time it was observed. Potentially impacted soil beneath the roll-off was excavated the same day and placed in drums for disposal.The material within the roll-off container was shifted within the container to allow access to the back door. The back door was opened (without any additional release of material), the rear seal was cleaned, and silicone was added to enhance the seal. The silicone was allowed to dry, and the back door of the container was closed. No further leaks were observed following the repair.All remaining materials utilized in the response activity (e.g., plastic, absorbent) were also placed in drums to await disposal.",The use of a liner within the roll-off container may improve the capability of this container to hold any liquid materials that maybe present.GRR will continue to conduct daily inspections of containers.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,15000,"GIANT RECOVERY-SUMTER, INC.",US,

Unit 1 departed the road to the right and travelled approximately 65 feet before rolling approximately one quarter times. Unit 1 impacted a fence and travelled approximately 36 feet.  Unit 1 then impacted a utility pole and came to rest on the roadside.  Local fire and police were dispatched and secured the scene and maintained intial isolation distance per the emergency response guidebook.  Airgas emergency response personnel arrived on scene to assist and determine the condition of the trailer.  ""Bubbler"" type neck leaks were identified on tubes 5 and 10.  Bubbler indicates that lead detection fluid bubbled continuously but not rapidly (approximately 1 cc/10 sec).  The leaks occurred for approximately 3 hours.  An LEL monitor was placed above the leaks to determine atmospheric hazards due to the flammability of hydrogen.  The LEL monitor never exceeded 7% of LEL.  The decision was made to transfill the two leaking tubes into an empty hydrogen tube trailer.  Once complete, the Airgas personnel checked the tubes for leaks again and found none.  The LEL in the atmosphere was also measured to be 0% of LEL.  After departure of the Unit 2, the tractor and trailer was uprighted by a crane and towing vehicles.  Unit 1 and tube trailer were then towed back to the Airgas facility.",The driver was found to be at fault for improper use of lanes.  The roadway was narrow in nature but not unsafe.  The only recommendation that could be offered is continued training on roadway awareness.  There should have been no reason to drive as close as this driver did to right part of the roadway.  He stated he was aware of the bar ditch on either side of the roadway but probably did not take into account the softness of the ground just off of the asphault.,Yes,CYLINDER TRL,"Seamless steel, made of definitely prescribed steels over 1000 pounds water volume",3AAX,Yes,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,69020,"Airgas USA, LLC",US,

While working at the customer location loading dock and parking area at 30 Rock Ave, Danielson, a Veolia employee noticed a small leak of liquid coming from another customer's 55-gallon drum that was previously loaded onto the vehicle. Upon closer inspection, it was determined that a drum of Trichloroethylene was slowly leaking on a bottom seam of the 55-gallon drum. Veolia reported this to the state of Connecticut DEEP (Environmental Agency) who also notified the local fire marshall of the leak. The location of the leak was the bottom seam of a 55-gallon drum. Duration of release was less than 1 hour. The leaking drum was removed from the vehicle and placed in an 85-gallon salvage drum and sent for appropriate disposal as originally contracted. A small footprint size stain on parking lot was cleaned up as well as a small amount of liquid that remained in the Veolia service box truck.","In the future, Veolia employees will double check drums coming from this customer when offered for transportation. Veolia also notified customer of the issue and requested that they inspect drums/review drums for leaks in the future.

When needed, Mansfield Oil Company will contact LubeTech for approval and verification of the load that is needed.  On Wednesday, December 31, 2014, Nate Kovacevich ,  Mansfield Oil Company was seeing that the level in Tank #72 was reading 1000 gallons in a 40000 gallon tank.  Nate ordered a load of 7500 gallons of winter blend dyed diesel fuel to dispatch, John  Bodine with Ratzlaff Transport.  Upon policy, dispatcher with Ratzlaff Transport, John Bodine called LubeTech to ensure that the load would fit.  He was told that the load would fit with no problem.  The load was dispatched to driver Brian Pevito with Ratzlaff Transport.  After loading at Magellan Pipe Line in Roseville, MN. and arrival at LubeTech in Roseville, MN.  the driver, Brian Pevito contacted LubeTech personnel and got confirmation and approval of off loading into Tank #72.  He was told that there was plenty of room for delivery.  The volume was 1000 gallons for a delivery of 7500 gallons going into a 40000 gallon tank.        The delivery was made using the customer’s pump into a storage tank farm.  At the same time, there was a LubeTech driver employee delivering into another storage tank.  The storage tanks are equipped with an over-fill sound alarm when the tanks reach a certain height level.  When the alarm went off, Brian thought this was the alarm for the LubeTech driver’s delivery.  Brian was assured by all checks and responses that his load would definitely fit.  Immediately upon investigation all operations were shut down.         Three quarters completion of delivery it was noticed that the Tank #72 was overfilled. After shut down of delivery operations of unloading, Brian Pevito proceeded into operations of  LubeTech for notification of the incident.  He was informed by another LubeTech employee that this was all ready done and the appropriate emergency response was in place. Brian offered to help but was told by LubeTech that LubeTech would handle all clean-up.        John Orsucci, LubeTech Dispatch Manager did investigate after the incident and stated that when the driver, Brian Pevito with Ratzlaff Transport arrived, tank #72  had a reading of 1000 gallons.  This is a 40000 gallon tank.  John Orsucci also verified that when the fuel was spilling out of the top of tank #72, the electronic gauge did still read approximately 1000 gallons.       As stated before, LubeTech would handle all emergency response actions and clean-up.           WCEC Environmental Consultants - 1241 72nd Ave. NE - Fridley, MN was the company that LubeTech called for clean-up.  WCEC project number for this incident is 10404.  Estimation of spill was 200 gallons within the containment, 50 gallons outside of the containment onto snow and ground,  with clean up of 0.5 cubic yards of soil and snow that was recovered.","Tank #72 was locked out until the electronic control system was repaired.  I have been told that this is now completed and working properly along with the manual level repaired as well.  It is recommended and training is now in place for all delivery drivers to also check the level after start up of delivery that the level gauge is indeed moving in the proper direction.

The leak was identified as coming through a seam in the outter jacket of the trailer.  We used our external emergency response team to help transfer the product (using vapor recovery) into a new trailer due to the nature of the product combined with the potent vapors.  The trailer has not been inspected to date and remains down for repairs.  The source of the leak is yet to be determined and could be anything from a true leak in the barrel, to a crack in a weld, to a damaged washout port.  This is perplexing as not only did the trailer go through its annual inspecton at the beginning of December but this load requires a special prep where the entire trailer must be pressure tested.  Not only do we perform this pressure test but it also recieves another pressure test at the shipping location.  Any leaks should have been observed at those times.",I will update this log when we learn the true source of the leak.  I can't give an official recommendation until we know the sure source of the leak.  On a seperate note we feel the processes we have in place between ourselves and the shipper are sound and that this is an isolated incident.

This is approximately 20 miles SE of Manderee, North Dakota. Driver indicated that the road conditions suddenly became very icy and slick. He observed that his tanker trailer was sliding to the side. He attempted to correct the situation, but was unable to do so before the trailer struck the guardrail. The tractor and trailer then slid off the road and rolled 1.25 times. The resting position of the tanker trailer caused diesel fuel to leak from the trailer vent and a small rupture in tanker compartment on the side of the trailer that was resting on the ground. The product was contained by creating a dirt berm around the spill area and the deployment of absorbent booms and pads. Diesel fuel in trailer was transferred to another tank trailer and a third party environmental response company was dispatched to the site to handle the product release and clean-up.",Drivers have been reminded of the hazards associated with winter driving conditions and the need to continually evaluate road conditions and to adjust driving according to conditions.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,106300,PILOT THOMAS LOGISTICS,US,

The road ahead had just been closed due to numerous accidents (it was snowy and icy).  The Akron fire department was diverting vehicles off the HWY at Road DD. As the driver was making a right hand turn onto a road that hadn't been plowed the turn was misjudged and the trailer tires caught the edge of the adjacent ditch and were pulled into the ditch.  This caused the tractor to come to a stop and it was pulled into the ditch by the trailer resulting in an overturn.  The tractor and trailer ended up on their right hand side. The drive was not injured, he was checked over on site by the local fire department and dismissed.  As a result of the rollover, the outlet valve was broken off and due to the tank being on it's side the fire valve was slightly dislodged resulting in a small leak.  An emergency response team was called in to cut a hole in the side of the trailer so that the load could be pumped to another trailer.  Due to the weather and closed roads this took several hours to complete.  The leak continued for approximately 9 hours and approximately 300-350 gallons of ethanol were lost into the ditch.  The remediation company is working on the cleanup process and have been delayed by the ever changing weather and will be completed as soon as safely possible.","This is primarily due to being in the wrong place at the wrong time and driver error.  Had the road ahead not been closed, traffic would not have been diverted onto road DD, and the accident would not have taken place.  We constantly stress safety and continued training takes place monthly for our drivers.

While negotiating the right hand curve within the Exit 142B ramp from the Garden State Parkway to Interstate 78    driver #1 stated in effect: deceased    Driver #2 stated in effect: I WAS GOING STRAIGHT IN THE CENTER LANE OF INTERSTATE 78 WESTBOUND LOCALS, AND THEN I SAW A GREEN CAR COME OUT OF NOWHERE, SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL.  I TRIED TO AVOID CRASHING AND SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES, THAT'S WHEN MY TRUCK STARTED TO JACKKNIFE AND I LOST THE CONTROL OF MY TRUCK.  THEN I WANT ACROSS INTO THE INTERSTATE 78 WESTBOUND EXPRESS SIDE AND FELT 2 IMPACTS COMING FROM THE BACK OF MY TRUCK.  I DON'T KNOW WHA HAPPENED TO THE GREEN CAR THE NEXT THING I KNEW, MY TRUCK WAS ON FIRE.      driver #3 stated in effect:  I was going straight in the left lane of interstate 78 westbound express, and the tanker came across into my lane and I couldn't avoid it.      witness #1 stated in effect:  I was going straight in the left of Interstate 78 Westbound Locals, and out of nowhere, a tractor trailer with a yellow cab ran across the highway from locals to Express!  I'm sure it was the truck with a box trailer.  I thought the driver fall asleep or he was having a heaart attack.  Then that truck got struck by the other truck.  I think he tanker.  That's when the tanker exploded.  I didn't even see the green car.      Witness #2 stated in effect:  I was traveling behind the green Audi and saw it speeding down the Garden State Parkway ramp.  Ath the end of the ramp, just as it reached the mainline of Interstate 78 Westbound Locals, he tried to change the lanes and lost the control.  The car just started to spin counter-clockwise.  The Audi then went into the lanes of travel, and the tanker had no chance of avoiding the car.  The tanker T-boned the Audi and they both went across the curb, and went into the Interstate 78 Westbound Express side.  The other truck had no chance of avoidin the tanker.  That's when the tanker exploded.    AT SCENE INVESTIGATION:    The undersigned witnessed a portion of the crash while handling a separate 1-car crash on the Interstate 78 Westbound to Exit 52 ramp to the Garden State Parkway.  Upon hearing the crash and witnessing the fire, the undersigned initially notified the NJ state Police Operational dispatch Unit North as a possible truck fire at 1242 hours, and the call was created at 1243 hours.
