DRUMS WERE SHRUNK WRAPPED TOGETHER (4 PER PALLET) TO SECURE AND LOADED BY GREAT WESTERN AS DRIVER APPLIED PLACARDS AND CHECKED CONDITION OF TRUCK & TRAILER. JACKSON TRANSPORT THEN PROCEEDED TO ANCHORAGE WHERE DRIVER STOPPED AT MILE 38 OF SEWARD HWY TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK AND AGAIN CHECKING CONDITION.  NO LEAK WAS DETECTED AT THAT TIME, HOWEVER AFTER DRIVING THROUGH SLUSHY SNOW & RAIN, WATER WAS DRIPPING FROM THE TRUCK AND TRAILER IN LARGE AMOUNTS. DRIVER THEN PROCEEDED TO ANCHORAGE, WHEN HE STOPPED AT THE POTTER SCALE. THE LEAK WAS THEN DETECTED.  DRIVER IMMEDIATELY CALLED GREAT WESTERN IN ANCH. AND GREAT WESTERN SENT A CLEAN UP TEAM TO THE SITE.  THR ALASKA STATE TROOPER INSTRUCTED THE DRIVER NOT TO OPEN THE DOORS OF THE VAN UNTIL THE CLEAN-UP TEAM ARRIVED. WHEN THE CLEAN-UP TEAM ARRIVED, SODA ASH WAS PLACED AND ALL SPILL DRIP AREAS INSIDE THE VAN AND ON THE GROUND AND ON THE SCALE AREA.  THE ACID WAS THEREFORE NEUTRALIZED IMMEDIATELY AND NO DANGER EXISTED TO PERSON OR PROPERTY. AT SOME POINT THE STATE TROOPERS OR THE SALE OPERATOR CALLED FOR INDEPENDENT CLEAN-UP RESPONSE IN THE FORM OF ANCHORAGE FIRE DEPT., ANCH. POLICE DEPT., NORTHWEST ENVIRONMENTAL INC. AND SO FORTH.  THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT NEEDED AS THE ACID WAS ALREADY NEUTRALIZED.  GREAT WESTERN SENT ONE DRIVER BACK TO ANCHORAGE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT SUCH AS PUMPS, CONTAINERS, MASKS & SO FORTH.  THE CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS WERE WELL UNDER CONTROL WITHOUT ASSISTANCE FROM OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS WHEN THE STATE TROOPERS ORDERED GREAT WESTERN PEOPLE OUT OF AND AWAY FROM THE VAN. IN THE FACE OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AND NEEDLESS PUBLICITY, 1 BELIEVED GREAT WESTERN'S PRIMARY CONCERN WAS TO NEUTRALIZE THE ACID AND THEN PROCEED WITH CLEAN-UP IN AN ORGANIZED MANNER, AT WHICH POINT THE SITUATION WAS TAKEN OUT OF THEIR HANDS, AND THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM.

A THEN SPOKE TO DAVID NOLES AND WAS TOLD A TERRY WOULD BE IN CONTACT WITH ME WITH DISPO. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED DISPO TO DATE.  I ALSO SPOKE TO DAVE WITH AACT SAFETY AND I WAS TOLD HOW TO DISPOSE OF THE HAZ. I SUITED UP IN THE HAZARDOUS SUIT WITH GLOVES AND MASK AND PUT THE 5 GAL PAIL IN A 60 GAL DRUM.  PUT OIL SOAK MATERIAL ON THE GROUND TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT.  I THEN SHOVELED THE MATERIAL AND PUT THAT MERCHANDISE IN THE DRUM WITH THE PAIL. THE QUANTITY THAT LEAKED WAS MINOR.  THE FUMES WERE NOT.  AFTER I CLEANED THE YARD AND DOCK OF THE HAZARD I HAD A DOCKMAN PUT THE DRUM IN A SAFE MANOR IN AN OUT OF THE WAY AREA TO PREVENT ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM HAPPENING.  THE SALVAGE DRUM WAS SEALED AND THE HAZARDOUS SUIT, RUBBER GLOVES, AND MASK WERE PUT IN A TRASH BAG AND ALSO PUT IN A SAFE PLACE.
