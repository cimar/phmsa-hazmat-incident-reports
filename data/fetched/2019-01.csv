After reviewing the movement history of the car we found that it was spotted in Houston Fuel Oil Terminal on 1/1, moved within the plant a couple of times, then released back to the PTRA for spotting at a later date.  Per discussion with TXDOT, since HFOT accepted the car then released it back into transportation the responsibility to ensure the rail car is properly secured for movement falls upon HFOT. The PTRA called out Slick Response services to inspect and install a manway gasket, secure the manway to tool tight specifications and pressure wash the product from the exterior of the tank.",I emailed the cause of the leak to the customer.

First the unloader said to hook his hose up and they would use their pump to unload.  They realized their pump shouldn't be used shortly in to it.  The second spill was at the end of the offload.  He was able to clear the line from the trailer to the pump but was having difficulty clearing the section from the pump to the customer tank.  When he disconnected another 6 ounces spilled on to the ground.,The driver is new and failed to follow his training.  On the first spill he should have opened the bleeder valve that comes off the trailer external valve.  Then walk the lines several times to it draining off approximately 3-4 gallons which would create a big enough air pocket in the hose to safely disconnect from the highest connection point.  On the second spill he should have walked the lines to the 'petcocks' on the pump and again drained off 3-4 gallons before disconnecting from the highest point.  Driver was coached on both of these and is also being brought in to spend some time with the training team to ensure he has a good grasp on various unload situations.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

After that he began to fill the tank, while filling he heard an intermittent whistle. He waited and listened for the gurgling noise but that noise never came so he stopped and went up to the truck to see how much he had pumped, which was 150 gallons more than the 275 gallon tank could hold. No one was home so he called the owner who arrived a few minutes later and let him in. They went down into the basement where he saw the plug sitting on top of the tank, which is why the whistle did not work properly. The drain on the floor was plugged and the majority of the product ran out of the basement in a clay pipe which emptied on a hillside and ran into a ditch that contained the product until it was cleaned up. Within 2 hours an Environmental Response team was dispatched to the scene, the NRC was notified (1235774), the Ohio EPA was notified 1901-EPA-0096, and the Stark County LEPC was notified.","In our spring safety meetings we will be emphasizing the importance of taking your time and being overly cautious when filling tanks.

At the carriers distribution hub in Wilmington, NC, a freight handler notified his supervisor that the package was""smoking"". The supervisor relocated the package to a remote location at the facility and phoned the Corning Wilmington facility(consignee) at-0600 on 1/9/2019. Coming Wilmington personnel responded to the call and went to the carriers facility. They inspected the package and noted that there was no smoking(or vapor) being released. They noted no wetness or liquid on the outside of the package. They packaged the box with vermiculite into a UN 1 H2 polypropylene drum, reproducing hazard marks and labels on the outside of the drum. The carrier then continued transport of the shipment to the destination, making Coming the first stop for the truck. At Corning Wilmington, the package was received and taken to a fume-hood where the box was opened and inspected(see photos 1-2) Observations upon examination of the box contents:  The plastic barrier bag containing the bottles was intact and contained liquid material. The bag was examined; there were no rips, tears, or damage. The tie-wrap securing the plastic barrier bag was intact. The Styrofoam inserts were deformed, appearing to have been chemically dissolved.  None of the bottles were broken. All four caps for the bottles were sheared(unevenly with a jagged break) across the top. The lower threads of the caps were still on the bottles, but the tops of the caps had separated from the bottles and were no longer affixed(see photos 3-4). Secondary closures(tape and paraffin wrap) were still intact on the bottles and held the lower segment of the bottle caps. Post-incident investigation: The barrier bag contained the liquid, such that the only possible route for the vapor to escape was through the neck of the bag secured by the zip-tie. Based on the amount of liquid remaining in the bag, it appeared that only a small amount of vapor had been released. Coming personnel replicated the cap shearing/failure that resembled the broken caps as found in the package by slightly over-tightening a cap by hand. We are not aware of any conditions that would have created a pressure significant enough to pop the tops off of the caps.","• Test alternate cap/cap Iiner(insert) combinations for chemical compatibility(vendor sending alternates to be tested). • Obtain and use torque wrench for tightening caps on bottles to a specific level to avoid over-tightening(already on order). • Cease the use of Styrofoam packaging inserts for this material due to chemical incompatibility(effective immediately). • Order new, more robust packaging system that uses hydrostatically-tested metal cans as intermediate packaging and fiberboard separators(already ordered). Use barrier bag to contain bottle inside intermediate can. Devise alternative technique to close barrier bag securely, not allowing vapor to escape. • Update and supplement hazardous material transportation training and procedures for Coming employees based on findings and corrective actions from this incident • Cease shipment of this material until all corrective actions have been addressed and a resolution has been identified and implemented.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,SOUTHEASTERN FREIGHT,US,

The contractor secured the tote and left the site at 0205 EST. The shipper was then contacted about whether to replace the whole tote or just a new gasket then left the site. On February 4, 2019 at 1509 the shipper confirmed with ERTS via e-mail that a new lid/gasket would be shipped and did not require any further need for the contractor to go on site.

The roadway had patches of black ice.  Semi-trailer tires lost traction on the ice covered roadway.  Centrifugal force caused the semi-trailer to slide outward.  The semi-trailer separated from the truck-tractor and slid off of the roadway.  The semi-trailer slid across the snow/ice covered shoulder of the highway.  The semi-trailer slid over a concrete fixture that caused a puncture of one compartment containing diesel fuel.  Approximately 1600 gallons of diesel fuel leaked from the compartment onto the snow/ice covered shoulder.  Clean up crew contained the product in a pool on top of the icy ground.  The product was picked up using suction pump equipment.

The waybill lists the cargo as 11 PCS of FAK (Non  Hazardous). In the interest of safety, the unit was placed on hold pending interior inspection and moved to the containment pit.  Interior inspection revealed 11 shrink wrapped palletized Desserthog Battery Packs, stowed down the middle of the container with wood blocking  throughout the container and at the rear for securement. The 10th battery pack from the rear has fallen over to the right side of the container and was  leaking.  Premium Enviornmental was contacted on behalf of JB Hunt and they dispatched Patriot Environmental Services to remediate this load. Patriot did  deem the liquid leaking out of this unit to be UN 2794 Battery Acid (Hazardous). The origin of the leak was the 10th battery pack from the rear that had fallen over from a warped floor. Approximately 1 gallon was contained in the container and less than a gallon was able to reach the ground in the haz pit.  Per Eddie from Patriot the floor was too warped to reload the battery packs into the same container. The battery packs were reloaded into JBHU254679. This incident has been deemed as shipper   s responsibility and all contractor cost from Patriot Enviornmental will be billed directly to JB Hunt Transport.
