The Train Crew personnel and Mechanical Department identified the release due to a strong odor of Ethanol when directly next to the car.  The cause of the release was identified by BNSF Mechanical HMERT Responder as loose man way swing bolts, as the car had zero pressure when attempting to relieve the internal pressure to inspect the man way.  Three of the eight man way swing bolts were identified as less than tool tight and required tightening to secure.  The man way seal (Seal # 74311) was removed for inspection of the man way gasket to ensure a gasket was present.  The gasket was present and in a serviceable condition.  The man way was then secured to allow movement with a replacement seal (Seal # 542209) applied.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Westlake, was notified. SPSI, a CSXT response contractor, responded and found a release coming from the liquid line valve. SPSI observed visible icing around the plug of the liquid line valve and observed high readings of VOC on air monitoring equipment.  It was determined that the liquid line valve would not close any further and the plug was not installed properly.  Once the plug was installed properly the release was secured.  A field transfer is scheduled for a future date and the car will not continue in service until it is transferred onsite. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Westlake (Mr. Harris C: 270-703-9367; dharris@westlake.com).

DRIVER STATED HE TRIED TO LET THE TRUCK SLOW BUT WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO BRING THE TRUCK BACK ONTO THE ROADWAY THE LOAD (PROPANE LIQUID) SHIFTED AND CAUSED THE TRUCK TO OVERTURN. TRUCK CAME TO REST OFF THE ROADWAY ON THE BORTH SIDE OF THE ROAD. DRIVER SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES (CUTS AND BRUISES) AND WAS EVENTUALLY TRANSPORTED TO HOSPITAL AS A PRECAUTION AND TO HAVE CUTS TO HIS HEAD TREATED. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT THE DRIVER STATED THAT THE CAB HAD FILLED WITH PROPANE VAPOR AND HE TURNED OFF THE IGNITION BEFORE EXITING THE CAB OF THE VEHICLE. THE TANK ON THE TRUCK WAS VENTING PROPANE FORM THE VAPOR VALVE AT THAT POINT. DRIVER ACTUATED THE EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF SYSTEM ON THE TRUCK/TANK WHICH SHUT OFF THE INTERNAL VALVES ON THE TANK. ONCE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL HAD ARRIVED AT THE SCENE (TODD COUNTY EMA) THEY SECURED THE SITE AND EVACUATED ON RESIDENT THAT LIVED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY THE ACCIDENT. NO OTHER RESIDENT WERE HOME DURING THE TIME. DRIVER WAS TRANSPORTED TO HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT. ONCE ADDITIONAL HOLSTON GASES PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE SITE THE TANK PLUG WAS REMOVED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK TO EXPEDITE THE VENTING OF THE PROPANE VAPOR BECAUSE ALL PERSONNEL INVOLVED DID NOT WANT TO ATTEMPT TO UPRIGHT THE VEHICLE UNTIL THE PROPANE TANK  HHAD STOPPED VENTING PROPANE VAPOR FOR SAFETY REASONS. ONCE THE PROPANE VAPOR HAD STOPPED VENTING THE PLUG WAS REPLACED AND THE VEHICLE WAS UPRIGHTED AND TOWED TO A LOCAL TOWING COMPANY (3 DOGS TOWING) LOCATED AT 980 ALFRED THUN ROAD IN CLARKSVILLE, TN. ONCE TRUCK WAS UPRIGHT HOLSTON PERSONNEL OBSERVED THAT THE LIQUID LEVEL GAUGE ON THE TANK WAS READING 17%. DRIVER INDICATED 28-30% WAS ON THE TRUCK AT THE TIME  OF THE ACCIDENT.

As a result of the puncture, approximately fifty(50) pounds of black paint released to the concrete surface and trailer interior. At approximately 11:16 AM CST, a representative from RLC retained Cura Emergency Services, LC (CES) to manage the environmental remediation of the site on their behalf. Based on the available information, the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from NRC Environmental Services (NRC) to assess and remediate the site on their behalf. At approximately 1:10 PM CST, a crew from NRC arrived on-site. Following a site assessment, NRC observed approximately fifty (50) pounds of black paint released to the concrete surface and trailer interior. NRC deployed granular absorbents to the impacted surfaces and utilized hand tools to collect and containerize all spent absorbents into one(1) 55-gallon drum for transport and disposal. NRC then deployed Simple Green cleaning solution to the concrete surface and trailer interior to remove any residual product and staining. NRC utilized absorbent pads to collect and containerize all spent cleaning solution into the drum.

The driver was unloading Ammonium nitrate emulsion (UN3375) from a DOT 407 tanker trailer into a bulk bin.  The driver was away from the controls while doing this- driver claimed to be on the opposite side of the vehicle.  Being in said position is not in compliance with Austin Powder Company policy.  The 100 PSI burst disk on the tanker blew, and caused roughly 3,000 lbs of the material to spray out and be released onto the ground.  The spill was contained to a large gravel pad, and no drains or waterways were impacted.  Austin arranged for an outside contractor to clean the material up.  A vacuum truck sucked up the material and placed in in 12 drums.  Much of the material was returned to inventory for use.  The remainder that could not be used (2 drums of contaminated material) was taken to a disposal facility, where it is currently being profiled.  Once the test results are in, the material will be disposed of according to the profiling.","Our policy is for drivers to be at the controls during the unloading process.  While it seldom occurs, burst disks rupture and having the driver present at the controls mitigates the potential amount released.  This driver was violating company policy. He was given a suspension for the misconduct.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Shell Chemical, was notified.  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the car was leaking product from the bottom outlet valve.  HEPACO contained the release by application of a Hazmat Hammock.  The car was then moved into CSX’s adjacent yard tracks to an area it could be isolated in an effort to reduce any risk to the safety of the public or CSX employees.  HEPACO continued to monitor the car until such time that Joe McCann, CSX Sr. Manager of Hazardous Materials, mobilized to the site.  Upon Mr. McCann’s arrival it was determined that the release was persisting due to a faulty bottom outlet valve and a secondary closure cap with a worn gasket.  Mr. McCann, and HEPACO personnel, removed the secondary closure cap and installed a new gasket into the closure cap- this stopped the release of product from the car.  Subsequently, Shell personnel, and HEPACO, transloaded the contents of the car into a non-defective tank car so the contents could be forwarded on; the SCMX 6511 was moved to shop for repair via OTMA.",(NAR code:551 bottom outlet valve ),No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,20000,CSX Transportation,US,

The driver asked the shipper about hazmat paperwork and he was advised at their location that it wasn’t needed which he took to mean the freight was non-hazardous. The shipper loaded, secured and sealed the shipment so the driver was unable to view the freight and see the markings/labels on the freight prior to departure. The driver sent a message to dispatch that he departed. Dispatch contacted the shipper/calling party contact via cell phone to verify we had the correct freight since we were expecting hazmat, at which time the customer advised it should have been hazmat. Dispatch asked the driver to stop in the next safe location and permission was given by the customer to break to seal to verify. Driver discovered hazmat required markings and labels on the freight. The shipper left the facility immediately after our driver departed so they were unable to provide paperwork until they reopened in the morning. Driver was 17 miles from the shipper, but not at a location he could park overnight. The nearest FedEx facility with parking was 32 miles and nearest truck stop with parking confirmed was 26 miles away. The customer gave permission for the driver to return and park at their location overnight, so we selected that option since it was the shortest transit. The driver was given correct hazmat paperwork and placards before departing their location on 12/19/2019.",FDCC: reviewed procedure with the driver that requires a phone call any time the freight received does not match the description given. Message also sent to the fleet as a hazmat process reminder.

Fittings were of both a threaed and a ""secured by band clamp,"" similiar to that on the top of a drum, but of approximately 3"" diameter. Outage space was pressurized to 5psi with nitrogen. Ultimate failure on 5 of 8 packages was a loosening of a single screw holding each band clamp, causing the internal pressure to force material out as it sloshed within container during transit.  Employees and driver noted faint ""residual"" smell of material at time of loading and departure. None noted concerning smell or visible release of material.  Driver noted that smell increased as he worked through the morning, though it did not reach an alarming level.  Approximately 5 hours and multiple stops from departure, shipment arrived at consignee. Smell was then noted as ""strong"" and consignee did further inspection of packages. It was then found that material was run from top of packages and leached between package and encapsulating stretchwrap. Only 1 of 5 packages released enough material to stain approximately 12"" diameter spot on floor. No trace of material was found on underside of wooden trailer floor, with no release outside of trailer.  Chemtrec was contacted, report # 2019121200246.

Upon exiting vehicle, driver observed rear inner tire of tanker vehicle was on fire and the fire was too large to extinguish with vehicle fire extinguisher. Driver immediately contacted fire response agency by calling 911. Fire Department responded and extinguished fire. Heat from the fire impinged on bottom tank flange and damaging corresponding gasket. Damaged gasket resulted in a small but consistent leak from bottom flange outlet.  Driver placed absorbent pillows to contain the spilled sodium hypochlorite(bleach)and prevent entry into highway drainage ditch. CaITrans was onsite and provided additional dirt to erect a larger containment pond to prevent sodium hypochlorite from entering drainage ditch.  With the coordination of the local Fire Department Hazmat team and the California Highway Patrol, Hasa personnel arrived on scene and immediately began the transfer of remaining liquid from damaged tanker to another empty tanker. As tanker was being emptied, a hazardous waste response contractor, National Response Corporation (NRC), utilized a pump truck to recover the spilled bleach contained in the small containment pond erected to mitigate further spread of the spilled material. NRC utilized water to spray down area of containment pond to ensure that all residual bleach was recovered and area was cleaned. All wash water was pumped with spilled material into Intermediate Bulk Containers for further disposal. Duration of release was approximately 5.5 hours with approximately 900 gallons spilled and recovered with the use of pump vehicle.","Provided refresher training to all drivers to ensure proper daily vehicle inspections of all equipment is being accomplished properly, specifically focused on brake and tire related system components.

Approx 1.5 inches of product was in containment with approximately 30 gallons of product was outside on the concrete and parking area.  During the unloading process, customer employees monitor the tank level from the control room due to no local level display being available at the storage tank. During the filling process the customer employee left the control room and during the time he was away, the overfill occurred.  Due to the chemical line of fire, our employee was unable to immediately reach the tank shut off values.  He made the decision to reach into the line of fire and turn off the shut off valve on his truck.  He immediately went to an emergency shower and washed off.  He then called the BOM to report the incident.  BOM said he needed to go wash at least a second time.  Our employee did finally reach the customer employees to report the spill and they initiated the clean up. Per the driver the clean up was in progress and nothing had left the property while he was onsite.   383 POUNDS released.    Site management at SPF worked to clean up the release when it happened.  The Univar Solutions driver was told to leave.  Univar Solutions management continued to follow up and assist with waste disposal from cleanup.",Univar Solutions root cause analysis recommends that we reach out to SPF and determine if we can ensure their employee remains on site and with our employee during off loading of our tanker trucks.  We need to ensure that there is someone in the control room to evaluate the tank levels so that this does not happen again.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,UNIVAR USA INC.,US,

The unloading process utilized plant air at approximately 20 PSI. After product began flowing, driver noticed that there was product dripping from the QRB external valve clamp. The driver intended to tighten the QRB clamp to stop the drip while the product was still unloading and under pressure, but, loosened the QRB clamp instead.  When he did so, the clamp ""blew off"" causing the QRB manifold and clamp to separate from the QRB housing hitting the driver in his right hip which caused a small amount of caustic to splash under his face-shield getting some caustic on his lips. Driver was treated at the customers site for the burn on his lips then sent to an Urgent Care facility for evaluation/treatment. Driver was later released from Urgent Care with ointment (lip-balm) to condition/treat his lips.

Reportedly, the product was coming from the bottom outlet valve.  The Consignee, Kinder Morgan Bulk Terminals, was notified directly to inform them of the situation and to provide  Conrail a responsible party at Twinco Romax. Hepaco, a Conrail emergency response contractor and Hazardous  Material Manager Joe Caccamo, were dispatched to the Port Reading Yard. After further inspection it was found that the leak was caused by a partially open bottom outlet valve handle. The toggle on the bottom outlet pin was in the straight position which allowed it to come out and the valve was able to partially open. The toggle on the  bottom outlet pin was lubricated and placed back after the valve was placed in the closed position. Additionally, it was found that bottom outlet valve cap and bonnet were less than tool tight, the vapor valve was partially open and both the vapor and liquid line secondary securement plugs were less than tool tight. All items were properly  secured. The tank car also had a broken weld on the safety handrail on the left side of the tank car that Conrail Mechanical forces repaired prior to placing the tank car back into transportation.

At the end of the offload 100 gallons came out of the top of the customer tank.  The initial report was that it was the last surge of air that came through the lines.  After further review the driver felt the air start to go through the lines and he shut down right away.  As he was closing the internal valve he noticed product coming out from inside the building meaning it was happening prior to the hose going empty.  Based on the math prior to delivery there should have been 300 gallons of extra headspace in the customer tank and driver was using minimal air pressure (15psi).  There customer wasn't assisting in the offload or it could've been minimized.  We also train our drivers to shut down when they are nearing the end of the offload and then just crack the external valve open to minimize the effects of transitioning from liquid to air in the lines.  Driver had stated that the tank was no see through but we later learned it is semi-transparent, the lighting was fine at the time, and there is markings on the tank.  We also believe this to be an overflow issue, not the last surge of air.",We submitted a request for the customer to verify their tank calibrations to avoid a future repeat.

He traveled on US-27 northbound in the left hand lane from Posner Blvd to Access Rd., then made a left on Access Rd and pulled into a restaurant. At approximately 1220hrs, as he was parking, a red Hyundai with 2 occupants pulled in front of him and stated his trailer was Leaking. The driver confirmed the complaint, seeing product Leaking from around the manhole cover and down the sides of the trailer. The passenger of the red car said he had some splash into the car and onto. his face and arm. The driver said she did not have any contact with'the product but could smell It. Vehicle was secured and the fire department took control of the scene. Preliminary investigation found that after receiving the trailer into service from the shop, the driver failed to properly close the dome lid, in order to make ready for product transport. It is estimated that the length of time of the release to be a few seconds to under a minute. The dome lid was cracked open and unsecured, leading to a splash condition through the cracked open lid during normal on-road maneuver.","Immediate actions taken Included remedial/refresher training for receiving and preparing equipment from the shop to make ready for transport.
