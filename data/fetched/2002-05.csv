THE CAUSE OF THE SPILL WAS A VALVE BEING BROKEN OFF A FUEL TANKER TRUCK AFTER THE OPERATOR OF THE FUEL STRUCK THE BUMPER OF A PARKED DUMP-TRUCK WHILE TURNING A CORNER IN THE FUEL TRUCK.  AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF DIESEL FUEL LEAKED UPON THE ASPHALT PARKING LOT BY THE TIME THE MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO CLOSE THE VALVE TO STOP THE FLOW.  THE RIVERTON SAFETY DIRECTOR WAS ON THE PREMISES AT THE TIME AND TOOK CHARGE OF CONTAINING THE SPILL WITH LONG ABSORBENT BAGS.  SHOP PERSONNEL SPREAD OIL DRY ABSORBENT ON THE FUEL THAT HAD COLLECTED ON POOLS IN THE VICINITY OF THE FUEL TRUCK.  VARIOUS PERSONNEL WORKED ON THE CONTAINMENT OF THE SPILL FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR (4) HOURS, UNTIL THE SAFETY DIRECTOR WAS SATISFIED THAT ALL THE LEAKAGE WAS CONTAINED.  THESE MEASURES EFFECTIVELY CONTAINED THE DIESEL FUEL FROM RUNNING OFF THE PROPERTY.  A NEIGHBOR IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE RIVERTON TERMINAL BEGAN PULLING ON AND OFF THE RIVERTON LOT IN HIS PERSONAL VEHICLE AND CIRCLING THE BUILDING.  AFTER THE THIRD TIME HE CIRCLED THE BUILDING, THE SAFETY DIRECTOR INSTRUCTED THE STOP PERSONNEL TO CLOSE AND LOCK THE GATE, BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW THE IDENTITY OR INTENTION OF THE PERSON CIRCLING THE BUILDING.  NOT LONG THEREAFTER, THE NEIGHBOR RETURNED WITH PERSONNEL FROM THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND SELLERSBURG FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE GATE WAS UNLOCKED TO ALLOW THE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE HEALTH DEPT. AND FIRE DEPT. ONTO THE LOT.  BY THIS TIME THE FUEL SPILL WAS CONTAINED AND THE SAFETY DIRECTOR HAD CONTACTED ME, IN ORDER TO COME TO RIVERTON TO SPEAK TO THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE TWO AGENCIES.  I INQUIRED OF THE SAFETY DIRECTOR IF ANY AGENCIES HAD BEEN CALLED TO REPORT THE SPILL AND HE ANSWERED THAT THEY HADN'T BECAUSE HE THOUGHT AS LONG AS THE SPILL WAS CONTAINED ON OUR PROPERTY THAT WE WOULD HANDLE IT INTERNALLY BY CLEANING IT, THEN CALL AN ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY TO HAL OFF THE CONTAMINATED MATERIAL IN THE DAYLIGHT. UPON MY ARRIVAL AT RIVERTON AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 A.M., I MET WITH KATHERINE TAYLOR OF CLARK COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. SHE INFORMED ME THAT DUE TO THE VOLUME OF THE SPILL, THAT I NEEDED TO CONTACT AN ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE TO CLEAN UP THE SPILLED DIESEL FUEL AND TO CHECK THE LOCAL CREEK TO INSURE NO FUEL MADE IT THERE, THUS CONTAMINATING IT. SHE SAID THIS NEEDED TO BE DONE; SO CLEAN UP COULD BEGIN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I ASKED IF I NEEDED TO MAKE ANY CALLS TO OTHER AGENCIES AND WAS TOLD THAT SHE HAD ALREADY CONTACTED IDEM AND THAT THEY MAY RESPOND OR CALL BUT A PRESENT THERE WERE NO OTHER CONTACTS THAT HAD TO BE MADE. I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED JIM BURRIER OF MIDWEST ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC. HE ARRIVED AT THE RIVERTON TERMINAL AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00 A.M. IN THE MEANTIME, I ALONG WITH MS.

DAVID PROCEEDED NORTH ON SR 295 TOWARDS REIDVILLE OR JOHN B WHITE SR BLVD, IN SPARTANBURG SC AT ROUGHLY 0900 DAVID'S CENTER OF GRAVITY CAUSED THE TRAILER TO ROLL OVER AS DAVID WAS MAKING A LEFT HAD TURN, FROM SR 295 N ONTO JBW SR. BLVD. DAVID WAS CITED FOR THE ACCIDENT FROM THE INVESTIGATION OFFICER, JEFF GRANT OF THE SPARTANBURG POLICE DEPT, (864-809-1355). THE CITATION WAS THAT DAVID WAS ""GOING TOO FAST FOR CONDITIONS"" THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND SUNNY ABOUT 78-85 DEGREES. JERRY SPROUSE, FRED ADKINS AND MYSELF DROVE TO THE INCIDENT SITE IN JERRY'S CAR. JUST BEFORE WE LEFT THE CORPORATE OFFICE I MADE AN INITIAL TELEPHONE CALL TO PHILLIPS RECOVERIES, (1-800-947-6805/508 CHEROKEE ROAD, PELZER, SC 29669) TO MEET WITH US AT THE SITE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE MET RICHARD PHIPPS AT THE SITE. WE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AROUND 0935-0940, (DAN COOPER ALSO CAME TO THE SITE, FROM CAPSTONE INSURANCE SERVICES). ROGER TATE LATER CAME FOR FRED TO RETURN TO THE SPINX OFFICES. (LATER GREG MINTON DROVE BACK WITH FRED TO THE SITE, 1830) THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY COMMAND POST AWAY FROM THE 'HOT-ZONE' ON SITE WITH A MAN NAMED COMMANDER CARUSO AS THE SUPERVISOR. MR. CARUSO WAS THE CHIEF OF THE SPARTANBURG FIRE DEPT. MR. CARUSO HAD ENLISTED THE AID OF OTHER FIRE DEPARTMENTS, A HAZMAT RESPONSE TEAM AND AN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS TEAM ALL BEFORE WE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.  DAVID WAS TRAPPED IN THE CAB. TODD TEAL FROM 105 ROBBIE COURT,MAYO, S.C. ASSISTED DAVID FROM THE CAB BY BREAKING THE WINDSHIELD FOR AN EMERGENCY EXIT. MR. TEAL WORKS FOR HOPPER PEST CONTROL OF SPARTANBURG AND MAY BE REACHED AT 864-461-0649 AN ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE CALLED JBR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, (210 ALICE STREET/SPARTANBURG SC), HAD ALREADY BEGAN 'CLEAN-UP'. THE MAN REPRESENTING JBR WAS NAMED REX RUSSELL, (864-583-2727). MR RUSSELL PLACED DIRT BARRIERS ON JBW SR BLVD TO DIVERT THE FUEL INTO A 4,000-5000 GALLON VACUUM TRUCK. HE ALSO PLACED (3) WORK CREW IN THE LOCAL CREEK TO PREVENT 500-1000 GALLONS FORM SPREADING PAST A 1,000-FOOT STRETCH OF CREEK. A SECOND VACUUM TRUCK WAS USED HERE. TOTAL GALLONS COLLECTED WAS 28,000 GALLONS/6,000 GALLONS SENT TO ALLIED IN ALABAMA FOR DISPOSAL. PHILLIPS RECOVERIES BROUGHT 4 MEN, (1) SERVICE TRUCK, PLUS MIKE AND VICKIE PHILLIPS. WHEN COMMANDER CARUSO RELEASED PHILLIPS TO ATTEND THE TANKER, THEY DRILLED HOLES IN THE (3) CENTER COMPARTMENTS TO PUMP OFF THE REMAINING FUEL. JERRY CALLED DEARYBURY AND ASKED AN ALTERNATE TANKER COME AND ASSIST WITH THIS FUEL. DRIVER DAVID CAMP CAME TO ASSIST, (864-357-7467). MR CAMP DELIVERED THE SAVED FUEL FROM THE WRECK SPINX TRAILER.
