Mr. Ingram reported his finding to CR Trainmaster L. Stinger, who in turn contacted CR's A.W. Richter, Manager Risk Mgmt.  Mr. Richter contacted CHEMTREC, who in turn notified both the shipper (Eastman Chemical, Kingsport, TN) and Consignee (Sunoco, Inc., Philadelphia, PA; Frankford Junction Yard is serving yard for this Sunoco consignee).  Sunoco had Union Tank Car (UTC) Mobil Unit respond. UTC found all 6 manway cover securement bolts adequately tight, but were able to gain another 1/2 turn on all bolts.  Hissing ceased.  Car okayed to be forwarded to intended consignee's facility for further inspection.    On Wednesday, January 9, 2008, TILX 280687 was inspected by representatives of Sunoco, FRA, UTC and Conrail.  Manway cover (with Eastman seal applied; and number recorded and removed during inspection) opened and examined the manway cover gasket.  Noted the gasket on the AL side of the cover (approximately 3 o'clock position) as split completely through from the outter to inner diameter.

Upon the opening of these boxes they found cans of paint that were clearly marked as dangerous goods. The AWB commodity was showing spare parts.   There was no indication on the AWB or on the outside carton that there were dangerous goods inside as required by the TSA/FAA.   and IATA dangerous goods regulations   The said cargo was then put safely aside and the FAA Hazmat inspectors were notified by US Customs of the situation.   The FAA inspectors then cameto the BA Cargo facility on MON the 7th of Jan , and inspected the goods and determined that the paint was an undeclared dangerous good and should have traveled under the dangerous goods guidelines.

Apparently the blades on the forklift were protruding from the pallet and struck the pallet in front, thus puncturing the drum in question and causing the spill.  The punctur  ed drum was placed in a metal overpack drum and spill in trailer was contained.  The unit was placed in the yard with doors open per instructions from G.O. Safety Dept. The van was later pulled back to the dock and final clean-up was performed. The drum was moved to the OSandD bay on the dock, and t  he trailer was steam-cleaned. A couple hours later the metal overpack drum began leaking and got progressively worse.  Every attempt was made to contain secondary spill until the contracted hazmat response team, HMHTTC, arrived on the scene to perform cleanup.","Awareness follow-up with all dock personnel regarding proper forklift precedures in handling and transfer of pallets, particularly those involving Haz Mat shipments.

All eight of the BOV flange securement bolts were less than tool tight and the responder tool tightened these BOV flange bolts, which ended the product drip.  The responder also noticed product dampness around the top valve protective housing cover. The seal numbered 264110 was intact on the housing cover. The flange bolts for the liquid and vapor valves were found to be less than tool tight along with their corresponding closure plugs. The responder secured all these loose fittings. BNSF seal numbered 002424 was applied onto the protective housing cover. Securement and this response were concluded by 1125 hrs. CST, 1/09/08. All spillage evaporated.    Per specification stencil, CELX 23623's tank qualification was completed in 2004 by TTC TX and due in 2014.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

McLean Blvd,MEMPHIS,TN,38108,Shipper,"190 gallon cargo tank of liquid oxygen, mounted on a straight truck, blew the outer shell off while out on delivery. Incident is still under investigation. Cause has not been determined yet. The police did respond but no report has been filed as of today. Fire Dept also responded although there was no fire of any kind. The tank was filled at our facility on the morning of the incident. The driver made three stops to fill customer owned dewars (app. 41 liters each). The incident happened about six hours after the tank was filled. It appears there was an internal leak of liquid oxygen that entered the vacumm space between the inner & outer tank. This pressurized the vacumm space & caused the carbon steel outer tank to become brittle where it was in contact with the liquid oxygen. Something happened that caused the outer tank (shell) to fracture (truck might have just hit a bump in the road)& the shell was blown off the inner tank & off the truck. This tank had a road relief valve & was under low pressure. The liquid oxygen vaporized & dispersed rapidly.","After researching the incident, nexAir immediately put together a new training program focused on general awareness, safety, & new procedures.

He took his hammer and went around and tightened the swing bolts on the dome lid.  Apparently the thumb hold of the Chicago fitting cap was lodged under the dome lid when it was buttoned down and allowed some product to leak out into the crashbox in transit. It was discovered when the load got to the consignee.  The driver states there was a small amount of product in the crashbox when he got to the consignee.

Responders found liquid product leaking from the base flange of the liquid valve. Car would found in shell full condition with 2/4 securement nuts on the liquid valve less than wrench tight. After tightening the nuts, product continued to leak due to the overloaded state of the car. Contractor personnel removed approximately 400 gallons of product from the car and the leak stopped. Further inspection of the car revealed the following deficiencies: (1) 2 OF 4 Liquid line base flange nuts less than wrench tight, (2) 1/8 manway cover bolts less than wrench tight,  (3) The tank was overdue for test  last tested in 1997 and due in 2007, (4) 2/4 Placards faded, and (5) manway cover gasket deteriorated.

I came into terminal and Roy called me just as I was getting ready to call him. I could not get the door open and we thought it was because the drum may have been leaning against it. We drove the fork  lift out to get the door open, we found that both drums were upright and could not see why 1 was leaking. We got a reclamation drum and put the leaking drum in it and another reclamation drum to put the floor dry,gravel,and cardboard that was used into. When we removed the drum from the pallet, we c  ould not see a nail or anything sticking up from pallet that would have caused the drum to leak.",shipper was notified that it appears to have been a defective drum.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,

Weather conditions were snow and blowing snow with wind speeds 30 - 35 mph. from the north.  As Mr. O'Connor traveled west on 290th. St., he crested a hill and discovered the gravel road surface to be completely covered with ice.  Mr. O'Connor lost control of the vehicle and it entered the road ditch and overturned.  The accident damaged the vapor return piping on the rear head of the cargo tank motor vehicle.      The damaged piping allowed the liquid propane inside the cargo tank to release to the atmosphere.  The propane liquid immediately volitalized to a vapor.  The vapor cloud dispersed rapidly with the strong north winds.  There was no fire or explosion as a result of this release.    Mr. O'Connor notified his supervisor of the accident.  The Taylor County Sheriff's office and the Blockton Volunteer Fire Department responded to the release.  The Taylor County Sheriff's Office called for the closure of 290th. St. for a length of one mile, commencing with Yellowstone Ave. at the east end.  A single residence was evacuated at 3261 290 th. St. as a precautionary measure.  No other residences or businesses were located in the vicinity of the release.  The strong north wind dispersed the propane vapor cloud over open agricultural fields.    Officials of Clarinda Cooperative and the Blockton Volunteer Fire Department surveyed the scene and determined that an attempt could be made to close the valve leading to the damaged piping.  The attempt to close the valve occurred at approximately 1:30 p.m.  The attempt to close the valve was not completely successful and officials determined that they would let the balance of the propane in the cargo tank vent to the atmosphere.    The propane release ended at approximately 5:30 p.m.  A wrecker was called in to set the propane delivery vehicle back on it's wheels and return the truck to the roadway.    Once the truck was towed from the scene, the Taylor County Sheriff's Office opened 290th.

The stains emanated from the manway nozzle/cover. Inspection of the manway securement bolts revealed all six bolts were less than tool tight (finger loose). Responders properly tool tightened the manway securement bolts. After this securement was completed, PROX 43707 was moved and no further product release was evident during this movement in the railyard.

The customer had come and ""distracted him"" with a question while making the connection and he did not double check to insure that both ears were clamped down. Driver then opened the internal valve and the external valve prior to engaging the pump. Driver noticed the product leaking and immediately closed both the internal and external valves (pump was never engaged). Estimated amount that spilled was approx 5-7gal in jump hose. Customer immediately responded by containing spilled product with ""kitty litter"" and assisted driver in complete clean up. Customer to properly dispose of clean up material per state and federal regulations.",Driver was inherited in recent competitor buyout and was new to his former company with limited training. Corrective actions for this incident are the following: 1. Use of velcro straps at each hose connection to insure camlock ears are completely closed (completed). 2. Perform refresher training on Univar USA standard operating procedures relating to tanker load/unload processes (in process). 3. Perform a thorough site inspection using the Univar Customer Bulk Profile form (completed). 4. Review tanker/pump connections to insure better control of product flow (fixed pipe on fender to be removed).,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA,US,

As the customers fork lift driver was attempting to unload the pallet of four drums from our trailer he went in too high with his forks and punctured one of the drums. He removed the pallet from our trailer and placed the leaking drum in a contained area. The leaking drum left a trail of material about  5 inches wide and about 30 feet long in our trailer the remaining material was spilled on a concrete floor and containment area at the customers facility. I spoke with the customers Environmental and Health Manager and he said that they assumed all responsibility and would get the material cleaned up by neutralizing the material and using absorbent to remove the liquid. I was in phone contact with the driver during the clean up and he said the customer new exactly what to do and they did a real good and safe job of cleaning up the spill. Within an hour our trailer was cleaned and driver was released to continue his deiveries. No other material on the trailer was damaged or contaminated by the spilled material.

SCMX 4359 was cordoned off awaiting detailed inspection. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected SCMX 4359 and reported a product vapor hiss emanating from the thermometer well cap. The well cap was finger loose and the responder tool tightened the cap which eliminated any further venting. No liquid product was found. A contract responder conducted air monitoring around SCMX 4359 and found no detectable product emissions. In addition, the inspection revealed that the vapor line's closure plug was loose. Responders removed the screw type closure plug, applied Teflon tape to the threads and properly secured the plug. No product vapor was detected at this loose closure plug. Securement was completed by 1614 hrs. CST, 1/30/08. Disposition for home shop was requested for SCMX 4359 for further inspection and necessary repairs to the thermometer well piping which most likely incurred a breach.

They uncoupled from the car and notified myself as well as Polychemie, the plant where the railcar was going to be given to. Mississippi Department of Environmental Control and Mississippi Department of Transportation was contacted. They contacted FRA and the Hancock County EOC as well as the car owner. On 01/08/2008, United States Environmental Services,L.L.C. arrived on the scene as well as MSDEQ and Hancock County EOC. Once getting up on the railcar and inspecting the leak, United States Environmental Services,L.L.C. found the loader of the tank car failed to put on a gasket and shut a valve completely. The problems were corrected and the railcar was moved to a location for unloading. Port Bienville shipped the railcar to CSX on 01/09/2008.",I met with my train crews and office personnel and we discussed how the incident was handled and how we could do better in the future. We will have more training on the reporting of the incidents and will have a outline of how to handle such an event on each locomotive as well as all company vehicles.

Took Pictures then opened box and found two of four 4 liter cans of paint bent/crushed and leaking. Approximately 200 ML of fluid total escaped from the two cans. The two leaking cans were sealed in a plastic bag which then stopped the paint fumes from contaminating the air in the aircraft. The fumes never reached the flight deck. The paint did not contaminate the aircraft structure, as it remained on the shipping pallet, the flight continued to destination (Quito, Ecuador) without further incident, at which point the damaged cargo was unloaded by the company that chartered our aircraft.(SEE ATTACHED PHOTOS)",Due to the inability to determine how or when the inner packaging was damaged; I cannot recommend any corrective action.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"FLORIDA WEST INTL.

Immediately after product transfer began, Dow operator Jeffrey Sutton, noticed a small leak then a pretty good stream coming from the connection; Univar driver stated all connections were secure via orange velcro straps. Dow operator immediately notified Univar driver of the problem and the tank truck pump and product discharge valve were shut off. Approximately 1 gallon of Hydrogen Peroxide 50% was discharged from the fitting into a diked containment area. Succeeding the shut off, the fitting was secured via shims and the leak was stopped.",Connections should be double checked before unloading process begins.

I had them stay away from the spill untill I could retrieve the proper paper work for the freight and call the emergency hotline and determine the extent of the emergency. It was determined that we needed to clean the spill with floor dry and dispose of it in a O.P drum along with the leaking pails. It was determined that the pails had been stacked too high on the pallet and the weight of the upper pails crushed the bottom layerof pails in transit. When the bottom pails crushed they also cracked which led to the pails leaking.

Sekavec, Manager Hazardous Materials of a derailment involving UTLX 200553. Mr. Sekavec proceeded to the derailment and found the car laying en its right side to the south of the track. Upon inspection, Mr. Sekavec found no active release and no bottom outlet on the car. The release appeared to have come from the top of the car and then ran down the south side of the car. There was a stain on the ballast approximately 20 feet long on the south side of the car that appeared to have splashed out of the top of the car.  Mr. Sekavec requested the Kansas City, KS, Fire Department respond to rinse the car off to neutralize any product still remaining on the tank. Information from the shipper (Evonic Degussa) indicated that dilution with water was a proper neutralization and hazard elimination technique. Following dilution, Mr.  Sekavec climbed to the top of the car to check the pressure relief device rupture disk and verified that it was still intact. Due to the position of the car, he was unable to access any of the other valves to verify their security. During rerailing operations, the tank car turned further onto its right side and approximately 400-500 gallons of product were released from an unknown location underneath the combination housing cover. KCKFD was requested to respond again and apply water to neutralize and dilute the released material. Following the application, the car was stabilized and brought back to an upright orientation. Mr. Sekavec then checked the remaining valves and fittings, finding them all apparently secure with no signs of where the product was released. The car was then set back on  truck on the rail for transloading.The material that had pooled on the ballast was diluted until no more reaction was taking place with the organic material in the ground. Mr. Sekavec met with representatives from the EPA and Kansas Department of Health and Environment who responded to the incident. Mr. Sekavec conferred with them and advised the shipper s advice was to dilute the material with copious amounts of water and then remove the affected material from the area. Both KDHE and EPA advised that would an acceptable means of remediation.The excavated material was spread out on a flat area adjacent to the derailment site and soaked with water again after being leveled. That material will be allowed to stay in place following its remediation since there is no remaining hazard.The cause of the release remains under investigation. UTLX and the shipper were both notified as to the particulars of the incident to assist in determining the source of the release.

The load of sulfuric acid struck the derail and derailed the south truck (B End) to the east with the south end of the car starting slightly down into the roadside ditch. The north end of the car remained coupled to4 loads and a locomotive which prevented the car from rolling further into the ditch. The car came to rest leaning about 40 degrees. No tank damage, no failure of the packaging and no leaks.On Saturday, January 19, 2008 MMA attempted to right the car with a 150 ton railway crane. Due to the angle and distance from the derailed tank the crane was unable to make the lift. GAC Chemical was requested by MMA totransload the product from the derailed tank into an adjacent empty (residue) tank that was positioned along side thederailed load. During the transfer between the two tanks a small amount of product escaped through the loosed manwayon the adjacent tank car. The loss of product was estimated to be less than 140 pounds or 10 gallons. (Note: It wasnecessary to loosen the cover to accomodate pressure changes in the tank during transfer. The discharge was referredto by GAC Chemical as a burp) The local fire department was available at the derailment site during the transfer ofproduct. The fire crew was asked by GAC to wet the tank down using approximately 300 gallons of water to dilute theproduct.The tank was not damaged during the derailment and the discharge of product at the manway cover was not caused bytank or car apparatus failure.-",,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

Customer required truck assisted pump off into their storage tank. Ashland driver reversed connections between tanker-pump-storage tank resulting in material being sucked out of customers storage tank and into a 2000 gal. capacity compartment on tank wagon. Reversal of pump caused material to over fill compartment at which point it began spilling out of the compartment manway at the top of the truck. Investigation revealed that at the time this was occurring the Ashland driver was inside the cab of the truck with customer associate instead of actively monitoring pump and connections. Another customer associate alerted our driver to the fact that a spill was in process at which point our driver shutoff the flow of material by disengaging the pump. Driver assessed the situation and quickly with the assistance of on-site employees moved to contain and clean up the spill. Fire and Police responders were contacted and proceeded to assist with the mitigation and clean up of the spill. Ashland also called in Veolia Environmental in an emergency reponse capacity to complete the clean up and assessment of the spill.",Root cause analysis of this event has determined that this spill was entirely preventable and a result of human error/ negligence on the part of Ashland driver. Driver in question has over 15 years experience delivering bulk chemical products and should have executed the delivery without incident as well as been in position to monitor transfer process to prevent this type of event. As a result of this incident Ashland has proceeded to intensify its bulk transfer process training and refresher training. We have also invested in visual aids and equipment to apply to our equipment to eliminate the possibility of future reverse connections.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,3200,"Ashland, Inc.",US,

Later that morning at approximately 08:50, mixed precipitation started falling, the roads froze in a matter of minutes. Our driver was entering a curve on Hwy 49 at the intersection of Hwy 62, another truck was in the ditch alongside the road and partially blocking the road. Our truck slid into the other truck and the bed of the other truck punctured the wall of our cargo tank on the back right seam between the head and the shell on the corner. The release was ongoing for approximately one hour. We attempted to plug the hole but were only able to slow the leak due to the location of the puncture. A&D Environmental was called and dispatched a vac truck and crew. The vac. truck immediately started recoiering product Bottom water dams were constructed below the highway and 800 tons of soil was removed. S&ME Environmental took samples of the area and of the water supply wells near the site. The samples were clean. I have include a copy of th NCSHP report that includes a diagram.","I cannot see how we could have prevented this accident, I checked the roads befor releasing the truck and they were dry, and then froze in a matter of minutes.
