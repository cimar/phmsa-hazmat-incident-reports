Approximately 5 gallons of material leaked  from the container. Upon closer inspection it was identified that there were three small punctures  in the bottom of the drum most likely caused by a nail that was on the floor of the box truck. The  box truck was inspected at its home office prior to heading to the 10-day facility in Schenectady  and there were no signs of a leak at that time. It is believed that the bouncing of the vehicle on  the trip to Schenectady and the nail on the floor of the box truck caused the punctures in the  drum. The trained Veolia, Schenectady employees donned the appropriate PPE, overpacked the  leaking container and cleaned up the spill.","On 4/6/220, the Veolia EHS Manager required that all vehicles in the district are swept and checked  for nails or other sharp objects that could damage containers. Also, to check any possible screws or  nails that may be sticking into the cargo carrying portion of the truck.

The trailer was unloaded and two 55 gallon  drums were discovered to have a pin hole leak on the bottoms of the drums. Less than 1 gallon total liquid spilled onto the containment pad. The drums were overpacked into salvage containers and the  spill was remediated by trained Veolia personnel. The personnel who responded to the spill reported  that the drums appeared to be in good condition with no identifiable cause of the pinholes in the drums.",As a specific cause was unable to be identified it is difficult to make specific recommendations to  prevent a reoccurrence.

Reportedly, there was auto-refrigerated product around the BOV  and a gasoline like odor in the immediate area around the tank car. The tank car was isolated from personnel  in the Yard. The Consignee, Markwest Hydrocarbon Inc. was notified directly through their compliance  consultant Harry Hopes (704) 490-1891 hopes@spcigroup.com, since this car originally came from their facility.  Hepaco, a Consolidated Rail emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the Port Reading Yard. Hepaco  found that the leak was caused by a faulty disengaging bottom outlet valve and a less than tool tight bonnet  reducer at the 4"" threads. The bottom outlet valve was found to not be completely in the closed position and  allowed the release of the residual product. A wrench was used to tighten the bottom outlet valve and bonnet assembly  into the fully closed position. The shipper representative, Harry Hopes, was notified of the situation found. FRA Hazmat  Inspector Vincent Au was also notified of the defect and subsequent Non Accident Release (NAR) UTLX 212803  was re-inspected the following day to ensure no additional leakage had occurred from the BOV. The valve was  found to be fully closed and no further leakage of product past the ball valve.

The release reportedly migrated to several nearby storm drains, but was reported to have remained in the catch basins. No soils or waterways were reported as being impacted. The MD DOT applied sand to contain the release. Local first responders placed boom and pads around the drains to limit the migration. Hepaco (environmental contractor) was dispatched to investigate and remediate the release. Hepaco personnel utilized a Lime Solution to neutralize the product. All field testing of the several areas showed pH results of 5-6 at this time. Hepaco personnel utilized heavy equipment, a vacuum truck, hand tools and roll off boxes to collect the impacted sand and debris. Hepaco personnel utilized pads and boom to clean the impacted storm drains. All waste was collected and staged at the MD DOT service lot in Cumberland, MD until waste profiling and disposal could be arranged. Hepaco personnel utilized a vacuum truck to collect the remaining product still in the tanker. The Carrier (MC Tank) provided a replacement tanker.

He notified the  Veolia Transportation Coordinator of the release, at which time the tote was moved to the tail end of  the trailer in order to transfer the waste to a new tote.  All contents remaining in tote was transferred  to a new tote.","The screws that the mechanic used to affix the new placards to the trailer were too long which resulted  in puncturing the tote that was loaded inside the trailer.

For trailers with thicker sides, the screws used would not have gone through but  this particular trailer sides were not as thick. We have re-trained the maintenance group to look inside the trailer prior to working to make sure that all containers are away from the trailers wall in the event  that he needs to screw or mount onto the trailer.

After replacing the rupture disc yard personnel moved the car to a side track and the contractor noted a slight white vapor again but was unable to determine the source.  The contractor and shipper arrived at 0900 the next morning and rechecked the car and found what appeared to be a defective gasket under the rupture disc assembly.  There was no evidence of a release with the car sitting still so the shipper ordered replacement gaskets and returned on 5/1/2020 and replaced all gaskets on the car.  The mounting flange gasket under the rupture disc assembly only had 1/3 of the gasket in place with the remaining 2/3 missing.

The release was cuased by a forklift puncture. ERTS Dispatched Alpha Omega to conduct all on site cleanup activities. At 1605 EST, contractors arrived on site and stated approximately all 55 gallons of the material released. The material was dried in most places and tracked through the parking lot area and dock as well as released to the trailer floor. Contractors used absorbent powder in the trailer and on the dock to absorb any residual product and portland cement on top of it. They also placed the powder and portland on the release that was on the parking lot. The spill was measured at 10' x 36' area in the trailer, 60' x 40' on the dock, 12' x 40' under the trailer and 500' x 25' on the parking lot. Since the majority of the release on the parking lot was already dry, they used portland cement on the stickiest parts. The damaged 55 gallon metal drum was over-packed into a 95 gallon poly over-pack. Contractors departed site at 1907 EST.  On April 27, 2020 at 1126 EST, contractors arrived back on site to complete remediation and try to remove some of the staining.

Mr. Powell notified BNSF who isolated the car, made appropriate notifications and inspected the car. BNSF Hazmat identified that a load seal (Ferromex - 4735189) was on the protective housing.  The seal was removed and the inspection revealed that all valve closure plugs (3) were less than hand tight, the sample line plug was entirely out and the thermowell cap was less than hand tight.  A slight leak was observed by snoop to be coming from the vapor plug.  Responders closed the partially opened (1/8 turn) valve and the leak stopped.  All plugs were removed, cleaned and retaped prior to securing to a tool tight condition.  All closures were secured and inspected, the housing was resealed with BNSF seal 539987.

While putting the full container onto the ground the material shifted causing material to come out over the top of the container, between the secured tarp and steel roll-off container. Once the driver realized material was coming out of the container he immediately set the container on the ground to stop any additional material from coming out onto John Deere property. Incident review was completed and the root cause was determined to be the first dump of material loaded into the container had a higher moisture content than normal, in turn causing the material to shift when being put down onto the ground.","Meetings were held between Envirite of Illinois Transportation, EH&S,  John Deere Cylinder EH&S and Operations.  It was determined the material put into the container was too wet, caused by the waste water treatment operation.   Customer to communicate problems with filter operations and condition of sludge to driver prior to transport. Driver will have the ability to refuse transport if shipment is too wet.  Customer is discussing the use of temporary and permanent containment areas for the full container to be set down for the exchange with the empty.   Customer to determine viability of installing a system to pump down excess free liquids.  USE will pull the excess liner at the back of the container over the top of the load covering the last two tarp bows before putting the tarp into place, This technique is effective for dusty loads and we anticipate it will also help prevent spillage of loads that are wetter than usual.

As a result of the damage, less that one(1) gallon of free product was released onto adjacent cargo. R+L retained Cura Emergency Services, LC (CES) to manage the cleanup. CES dispatched a crew from Hazchem Environmental to assess and remediate. Following a site assessment, Hazchem personnel located one(1) damaged 330-gallon tote that had released less than one(1) gallon of free product onto adjacent cargo. Crews noted it appeared additional cargo was stacked on top of the tote, which combined with a load shift, appeared to be the cause of the release. Hazchem personnel donned the proper personal protective equipment and began to work. Crews neutralized the released free product with sodium bicarbonate and water. All impacted materials were collected and containerized within one(1) 30-gallon poly drum for transport and disposal. Crews utilized a forklift to raise the damaged tote over the new tote and transferred the contents through PVC piping. Once completed, Hazchem personnel released the new tote to R+L personnel and collected the damaged tote for transport and disposal.

Local Fire Department and Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) arrived on site to monitor events.   Immediate notification provided to NRC - Report Number 1276134. On-site investigation by in-house response team confirmed the tanker failed at the weld on the  tanker gauge.  In-house response team proceeded to close off contaminated area then pumped  the product from the compromised tanker into approved totes.   At this point both the Fire Department and Arizona DEQ stated they were satisfied with the initial  response and left the site.   In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate were collected and placed into the salvage drums. Once complete, the containers were secured and  placed onto the  trailer for continued transportation. Over the next day or so, in-house response team continued to clean the area and remove all  compromised soil.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was  observed. Drivers will continue to inspect each container during staging period as well as before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced  structural integrity.  IN addition, the shipper has been advised of the situation and have been asked to insure the waste  does not exceed that which it is profiled for.  We have concluded the cause of the release was due to high heat.  We will continue to monitor this product while staged and while in-transit.

R+L retained Cura Emergency Services, LC((DES) to manage the cleanup. CES dispatched a crew from Lone Star Hazmat(LSH) to initiate corrective actions. Following a site inspection, crews identified one(1) 55-gallon drum containing a flammable resin solution. The lid to the drum was secured incorrectly, allowing residual amount of free products to escape from the drum and impact the rim and exterior of the drum. Crews noted there was no impact to the trailer floor or any other surfaces. LSH personnel secured the lid to the drum but could not remove the residual free product from the drum lid and exterior. Due to this, R+L was unable to continue with the shipment of the drum. LSH personnel took possession of the drum and removed it from the trailer to be transported for disposal.

The air monitors did get a detect as the response crew continued to investigate the housing but all readings were below action levels.  All of the fixtures and fittings were checked and found to be too tight. the monitor was unable to pin point the source of the leak so ammonia detection tape was used around the valve flanges and along the pressure plate seam. the tape detected product coming from the pressure plate nuts and studs were marked with a wax pencil and impact gun was used to tighten the nuts in a star pattern. after 2 evolutions of star pattern tightening the leak stopped. it was found that the pressure plates nuts had each rotated a 1/4 turn. the housing was then checked again with monitoring tools and all readings were normal .

The seal was removed and the inspection revealed that all valve closure plugs (3) were less than hand tight, the sample line plug was entirely out and the thermowell cap was less than hand tight.  A slight leak was observed by snoop to be coming from the vapor plug.  Responders closed the partially opened (1/8 turn) valve and the leak stopped.  All plugs were removed, cleaned and retaped prior to securing to a tool tight condition.  All closures were secured and inspected, the housing was resealed with BNSF seal 539987.  All leaked propane quickly dissipated, estimated release volumes are based upon responders observations and are only rough estimates.",Shipper should ensure that proper securement is taking place once cars are unloaded.

Following a site assessment, FCE personnel entered the trailer to determine where the release was located. Crews observed a 55-gallon drum on UN1294(Toluene) that had been punctured by a nail at the nose of the trailer. Due to the location of the tractor-trailer on the narrow shoulder, FCE personnel deployed granular absorbent to the freestanding liquid and had the driver move the unit to a safer location for remediation. Once moved, FCE personnel utilized an extendaboom to remove the cargo from the trailer to access the damaged drum. Crews placed the damaged drum in an 85-gallon overpack drum to remove it from the trailer. FCE personnel then collected the granular absorbents from the trailer floor and reloaded the remaining cargo.
