The driver reversed his pump, pumping oil back into the producer's tank.  When the tanker was empty, the pump blew air into the bottom of the tank causing oil to flow out the top hatch on the tank.  The driver contacted his supervisor immediately.  After evaluating the situation, the driver was instructed to measure how much oil was left in the tank after the incident versus how much was in the tank when he began to load the oil.  An estimated 1.68 barrels of oil had flown out of the top of the tank onto the ground and down the side of the tank.  The supervisor contacted a vacuum truck and a steamer truck to meet him at the location.  The vacuum truck was instructed to suck up as much oil off the top of the ground as possible.  The steamer truck was then asked to wash the sides of the tank off, and wash down the affected dike area.  While the water was flowing down the same path that the oil had taken, the vacuum truck was vacuuming all of the water and oil thas had flowed down the slope.  After the steamer truck was excused from the location, the vacuum hose was walked to each puddle of water and vacuumed onto the truck.  The supervisor covered the spill with sphag absorbent after the vacuum truck had the water puddles all drained.","The  area truck supervisor has left a message to all of the drivers in his area about how this incident happened and how to prevent this from happening again.  The driver will be re-instructed on how to load and unload oil onto the tanker trailer.  He will also be re-instructed on how to pump oil back into a producer's tank.  The driver will have a meeting with the area truck supervisor, district supervisor, and regional supervisor to discuss the incident and how this could have been prevented.

All seven bottles were collected and disposed of as if they were haz mat as there was no one able to verify their contents other than the smell they emited. The suitcase was placed inside of a large plastic bag in case any of the alcohol leaked through to the outside and was sent on to MIA with only the unopened and labeled water bottles inside.,Passengers need to be made aware that only certain amounts of alcohol are allowed in checked or carry on luggage.,No,BOTTLE,"Plastic bottle, capacity 2 gallons or less",BOTL PLS,No,Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Alaska Airlines,US,

Leaking drum was located, and overpacked in specification container.  Loose bolt was found on floor of trailer.  Floor of trailer was cleaned, absorbant materials contained in overpack.  Shipment was returned to shipping facility for inspection and reload.  Loose bolt from trailer was found to perfectly match profile of container puncture.  Other than evaporative loss and the trailer interior, there was no release at the scene of the response.","Apparent cause of failure was the puncture of the container by a loose object on the floor of the trailer.

He positioned his vehicle in the unloading area, prepared his equipment, and donned his personnel protective equipment. He verified that the unloading valve handle was in the proper “closed“ position.  Upon removing the external cap, material began to flow out of the container.

Prior to shipment, the Veolia driver performed a vehicle inspection that included the tanker trailer and valve on the trailer.  All required vehicle inspections and registrations were current.  Nothing was identified as inoperable or improper for shipment.  The trailer was being leased to Air Products from Southern Tank Leasing Company.  Veolia transported the shipment approximately 10 miles from the shipper when the driver was alerted to a drip escaping from the rear valve of the tanker trailer.  A plastic bucket and inorganic absorbent was used initially to contain the material.  The National Response Center, City of La Porte police, and City of LA Porte fire department were immediately contacted.  Hazardous materials emergency responders were contacted and arrived within one hour of the initial identification of the release.  Responders containerized all the spilled materials and shipped it off-site for proper disposal.  The drip from the tanker truck was stopped and temporarily blocked.  The tanker was returned with a police escort to the shipper within 3 hours of the initial release incident.  Further investigation by Air Products into the leased  tanker truck found that some bolts inside the tanker related to the valve were not tightened sufficiently.","Shippers who lease tanker trucks must not only verify that proper inspections and registrations are current for the equipment, but must verify that all valves and bolts related to these valves are tightened properly prior to loading.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,4500,Veolia ES Technical Solutions LLC,US,

The tanker was then driven from shipper site to ROMIC (designated facility). At or about one mile (1) mile from shipper site waste corrosive mixture reacted with a residual material in the tanker remaining from previous shipment. The reaction of the corrosive mixture with residual material created a vapor gas dispersion release from the tanker dome hatch. The ROMIC driver pulled the tanker to the side of the road and local fire department responded. The tanker was observed for several hours until reaction ceased and the tanker was returned to the shipper and placed over secondary containment. During close examination it was determined that four securing bolts on the dome hatch were loose by one-quarter to one-half turn that may have allowed for the release of vapor. The tanker was fully inspected, dome hatch re-secured, exterior cleaned, and then shipped to ROMIC on January 18th, 2007 without further incident.",ROMIC is conducting the following actions to prevent future incidents. (1)Review and amend as warrented hazardous material transportation SOP specific to cargo tank clean out and pre-loading procedures.

CELLUCCI,"DIRECTOR, TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",42 Longwater Drive,NORWELL,MA,02061,Carrier,"At approximately 7:00 AM on 01/15/07 a leaking container was discovered at Clean Harbors in-transit storage facility located at 32 Tompkins Pint Road, Newark, NJ.  Please note that at the time of the release the container was stored in a fully contained section of a concrete floor warehouse.  Upon noticing the release, the warehouse supervisor retrieved the shipping papers for all of the materials stored in the warehouse, evacuated the immediate area, and notified his operations manager.    An in house response crew was dispatched to assess the situation.  Utilizing the appropriate personal protection equipment, and company health and safety procedures, the emergency response personnel entered the warehouse in order to identify the material involved.  Upon reviewing the material markings and labels, it was determined that the material involved was a shipment of hazardous waste flammable liquid, n.o.s. (xylene, toluene) 3, UN1993, PGII picked up from Hovione on 01/11/07 on EPA hazardous waste manifest 000600395FLE.  It was also determined that out of 29 drums shipped one drum had developed a pin-hole in the bottom seam and released about 10 gallons of material.  One additional drum appeared to have developed internal pressure and was beginning to bulge; however, no container failure occurred.  The response crew personnel utilized a pH indicator paper to screen the spilled material for any potential corrosivity.  They determined that the spilled material showed acidic properties.  The generator (Hovione) was contacted to inform them that there was an incident involving their waste shipment and that the spilled material was showing corrosive characteristics not disclosed in the shipping papers.  Although the internal investigation is still ongoing, Hovione was able to identify that there was an error during the preparation of waste material for shipment and that two of the drums containing small amount of Hydrochloric Acid were inadvertently grouped with the remaining 27 drums as being the same.  One of the drums that contained Hydrochloric Acid was the drum that had failed, and the other drum was the drum that was beginning to bulge.    The two drums in question were placed into appropriate salvage drums, all of the released material was cleaned up using an appropriate absorbent and placed into suitable shipping container for disposal at a fully permitted hazardous waste disposal facility.  Additionally, the shipping names for the two containers were changed to Waste Flammable Liquid, Corrosive n.o.s. (methanol, hydrochloric acid) 3(8), UN2924, PGII to reflect the corrosivity of the material.  The in-house clean up crew completed the clean up operations without any incidents and no off-site impact occurred.","Because this waste stream contained Hydrochloric Acid, it should not have been placed into steel containers.  Although, at times steel containers are authorized for acidic materials, they are susceptible to corrosion from low pH.  It is Clean Harbor’s policy not to transport acidic materials in steel container.  Additionally, the generator of this waste needs to complete a full investigation to determine how acidic material ended up in the drums and how it was allowed to ship without being properly identified.  Additionally Clean Harbor’s employees involved with this shipment will be reminded to perform a thorough drum inspection prior to placing the containers in transit.  They will be reminded to look for signs of corrosion, pressurization, or weakening of seams and chimes.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

By the time we got to the nose of the trailer he   was feeling a burning sensation to his face and neck and was having difficulty breathing.  A couple of the drums had slid partially off the pallets.  Looks like the plugs on top of the drums had a vent that was slightly leaking when the drums were moved or vibrated.  We sat the shipment in the yard   on the trailer and the residue dried up and odor disappeared.  We will attempt to deliver this shipment tomorrow.~~Dock worker Chris Carper did go to the doctor and missed the remaining 5 hours of his shift that day.

The spill was a result of an unloading hose that became disconnected while the transport was pumping crude oil off into the unloading station tanks. Reportedly, the hose had been previously disconnected by another driver and then re-connected without properly securing the locking ears of the hose connection. The vibration of the pumping process caused the locking ears of the hose connection to vibrate open and the hose became disconnected from the header/piping. The pump of the transport unit continued to pump crude oil until approximately 109 barrels of crude oil had been released. Upon discovering the release, the driver shut down the pumping operation and contacted the Sunoco supervisors.     The Sunoco Logistics supervisors immediately began notifying Sunoco management and HES specialists. The HES specialists contacted the National Response Center at 12:34 p.m.,and called for a spill response team to respond to the area. The warm temperatures of the day had caused significant melting of ice and snow from a recent weather event. The run-off water from the melting ice and snow carried the crude oil across a neighboring field owned by another oil company, and on to a drainage ditch and ravine that acted as waterways during heavy rains. Sunoco employees began using shovels and a backhoe to construct flume dams to control the flow of the water and contain the crude oil. The transport unit loaded some of the spilled crude and several vacuum trucks were called in to begin skimming the oil from the run-off water. The spill response team arrived a short time later and several more flume dams were constructed to control the water and provide areas to skim the oil.      The skimming operations were successful, and only 4 barrels of crude were lost.The spill response company cleaned the affected areas by washing the area, deploying containment boom, removing affected grass, and using absorbents. Cleanup and soil remediation continues in the field area just south of the release, but wet conditons on the property have prohibited the use of equipment on the impacted area. The property is being monitored daily, and the cleanup operation will be completed as soon as the weather and drying conditions permit.","Changes have been made to the unloading station hose connections, including using safety wire to secure the locking ears. All stations will be inspected to ensure locking ears are in use.

The shipment consisted of a ""Lifting Jack Machine"" and shipped/arrived as planned.  Post arrival, the shipper contacted ATL Cargo to advise that batteries may have been left on equipment.  ATL Cargo notified SEA and upon a closer inspection, 2 wet, non-spillable batteries were found installed in the equipment.  SEA cargo contacted Delta's Operation Control Center (OCC) for guidance.    SEA notified DL's Corporate DG group (DGMG) via our internal DG notification system. DGMG advised SEA to notify the local FAA Regional Office.

COLLEGE AVENUE,CUDAHY,WI,53110,Shipper,"At approximately 3:15pm on January 9, 2007 a Miller Compressing truck picked up a 12 yard luggar box from the GE Healthcare facility at 7624 S. 10th Street in Oak Creek. This facility is staffed with employees from ACE World Wide in a co- employment agreement and ACE is not licensed to receive, handle, use or store radioactive materials. This aluminum breakage box was packed by employees of ACE. This luggar box was then transported to the Miller Compressing yard at 1640 West Bruce Street in Milwaukee. Upon arrival, the incoming material set off a radiation detector, it was sent through again to verify the results and set it off again. At this point a Miller Project Engineer attempted to reach the contact person at the GE facility; he was successful in leaving a voicemail requesting a call back. He then quarantined the luggar box and area surrounding it until it could be investigated further.    The next morning the contents of the box were dumped on a hard surface and four pieces, scattered in the load, were discovered to be the source of the radiation. Shortly thereafter, employees from ACE World Wide and GE Healthcare were on site to investigate. The results were as follows:    •These articles were identical in appearance as black painted bars, approximately 8    inches in length and approximately 1 inch (maximum) in section.  •Halfway along the length of the bar a hollow tube (approx 6-7” in length) was    fastened that projected out at a right angle to the bar, thus making a “T” shape.  •A movable rod was positioned inside the hollow tube with a threaded end at one end    and a knurled knob at the other so as to be able to fasten the bar to some other     equipment or fixture.  •There were no labels that indicated the radionuclide or quantity of radioactive    material.     1.The only obvious markings were a white painted trefoil and the number 2040        followed by a roman numeral with each bar having the numeral I though IV.     2.The word “Radioactive” was stamped on one end of the black bar, partially        obscured by paint.     3.The word “Uranium” as stamped on the other end of the bar, with “8/95” stamped        on one of the edges.  •Radiation levels of each bar were consistently 1.5 mR/hr at the surface and 0.16    mR/hr at 1 ft with the beta shield closed on the ion chamber.  •With the shield open, the measurements were I 7.7-mR/hr surface and 1.6 mR/hr at 1    ft.  •Wipe samples taken from all four articles indicated that there was no removable    contamination.    After checking all the radiation levels and the fact that there is no removable contamination, it has been decided, that there was no danger to the ACE personnel that handled the pieces or the Miller personnel that transported the shipment.",GE Healthcare conducted an internal investigation to determine the origin of these pieces and concluded that they were not from any GE equipment. GE Healthcare is wrrking with Miller Compressing to ensure proper disposal of the items. All ACE World Wide employees were retrained on hazardous communications and procedures to folllow in the event of a repeat situation to ensure their safety. GE Healthcare and ACE World Wide are conducting ongoing meetings to make sure that a situation like this never occurs again.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,ACE WORLD WIDE,US,

The cause of this derailment was attributed to defective or missing rail fasteners which allowed the rail to roll. INTX 5026 was leaning and leaking product granules from the two end hopper outlets. The middle outlet of this three hopper configuration covered hopper railcar remained intact and closed. BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders reported that the outlet gates appeared to be in the locked position with no seals applied. The A & B-end outlets twisted open a couple of inches possibly from either faulty or damaged operating mechanisms. Opening of the outlets allowed product granules to escape between the rails for several car lengths. It appeared that most of the product granules in the A & B-end hoppers escaped.

The cause of the derailment was attributed to a catastrophic container floor failure of an intermodal container overloaded with corn. Intermodal container GESU 461255 was riding atop one of the intermodal flatcars that derailed. GESU 461255 sustained exterior damage but remained upright. During the process of clearing derailed rail equipment, GESU 461255 was placed on its side and removed from the main track area. GESU 461255 was later up-righted. When the lading inside GESU 461255 was checked, one damaged 250 gallon IBC was noted dripping product from the pressure relief type closure cap. The dripping ebbed as the ambient temperatures lowered and partially solidified the product within. Three other identical IBC’s (plastic IBC with aluminum wrapped insulation surrounded by a aluminum cage) had some structural damage but were not leaking. The contents of the four damaged IBC’s were transferred into a tanker truck. The remaining 12 IBC’s had repairs made to their outside cages and stored in a dry van for further disposition instructions. The entire shipment destined for export in the 16 IBC’s was later rejected for further transport. The product was degraded by the freeze/thaw cycles from ambient outside temperature fluctuations.

Road was on a slight upgrade and pitched on both sides. Road is gravel, packed, but muddy with some rutting. Driver advised as he was cresting a small hill as another truck approached him, so he moved over to shoulder to make room. Driver indicated as the gear grabbed the “pup” (trailer #2) began to slide on mud over the right edge. Driver tried to man uver vehicle back onto road but the pindle hook broke causing pup to to detatch and roll over shoulder to right side. Driver stopped immediately and checked for loss of product. At time of roll over no product was lost. He immediately called 911, company dispatch, as well as mine Safety. Nevada Highway patrol responded and left making no report due to private property. Atlas towing was called for cleanup and towing. Mine personnel came on scene to assist in pumping off product. At this time is when there was product lost, roughly 200 gallons. The mine personnel and Atlas had to hook up multiple compressors to pressurize the tank to pump off the product. Product tempurature in trailer was roughly 190 degrees so when the lost liquid hit the below 30 degree tempuratures the fertilizer began to set up before it could absorb into soil. Atlas and Newmont Mine Safety pumped off trailer, scraped soil, disposed of set up material in their holding pond, and deemed location clean. LW Miller Safety made a report to the EPA, report # 823120. At that time I soke to a “Nicole” 800-300-2193 x3 that advised that due to the amount lost, circumstances of set up product, and it having been private property that no additional reporting was neccessary. We apologize for our failure to complete this form as needed assure you that we will not fail again.",Driver was suspended at time of incident and brought to our facility for training and discussion. We feel our driver is a capable individual who had made and misjudged his position on the road and under estimated the slickness of the soil.

Communications between Energy Northwest personnel revealed that on January 23, 2007 an NCS Model LMP-10 Freon monitor, containing a 300 mCi Tritium source, was transferred to NCS Corporation for calibration without marking the shipment as UN2910 as required by 49 CFR 173.421(a). The monitor was shipped from Richland, WA on January 23, 2007 via UPS and received in Columbus, OH on January 24, 2007. The return shipment of the instrument to Energy Northwest was received on February 12, 2007 and was designated as containing radioactive material.  This LMP-10 Freon monitor is maintained under a general license subject to the requirements of 10 CFR 31 and Department of Transportation regulations in 49 CFR. Following identification of this incident, Energy Northwest initiated immediate corrective action to minimize the potential for future undeclared shipments of radioactive material. Specifically, Energy Northwest conducted a site wide search of Columbia Generating Station and surrounding areas to identify and control generally licensed devices. Furthermore, Energy Northwest personnel in a position to process the shipment of generally licensed devices were briefed to ensure heightened awareness.  Energy Northwest initiated an apparent cause evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the January 23, 2007 shipment. This incident is similar to an event that Energy Northwest reported to the Department of Transportation in a letter dated August 17, 2007 (Reference). The cause of both of these incidents can be directly attributed to a lack of clear identification alerting warehouse personnel that the article presented for shipment contained hazardous material. This condition is attributed to a less-than- adequate understanding of the regulations governing generally licensed devices by all responsible stewards. Had more robust corporate processes governing the control of generally licensed devices been implemented at the time of the January 23, 2007 shipment, this incident would likely not have occurred.  There were no consequences associated with this event. There is no evidence that the sources leaked during shipment. Furthermore, Tritium is a low activity isotope and during radioactive decay emits a beta-particle that is easily shielded. With these sources contained within the confines of the instrument housing as well as the associated shipping container, the potential for radioactive exposure of any individual as a result of this shipment was negligible.","Similar to the incident reported in a lefter dated August 17, 2007 (Reference), the cause of the January 23, 2007 undeclared shipment was the result of less-than-adequate processes governing the control of generally licensed devices. At the time this shipment was discovered (October 4, 2007), Energy Northwest was in the process of implementing corrective actions to preclude this type of event. Specific actions Energy Northwest is pursuing focus on enhancing formal processes governing generally licensed devices. These processes are to be implemented through enhanced training, procedures, and oversight to ensure consistent compliance with applicable regulations. Furthermore, Energy Northwest will appoint an individual for each licensed device to ensure day-to-day compliance with appropriate regulations and requirements as stipulated in 10 CFR 31.5(c)(12). Each generally licensed device associated with Columbia Generating Station will be clearly identified to inform station personnel of the device’s controlled status and appointed custodian. The shipment of the LMP-1 0 is a legacy issue that occurred well before the identification and implementation of these corrective actions. Following complete implementation of these corrective actions, the occurrence of undeclared shipments of this nature is expected to be precluded.",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,ENERGY NORTHWEST,US,

He found tank #2 and stuck the tank, which had a reading of 74"". He then found tank #1 and stuck the tank, which had a reading of 23 1/2"". James did not know if tank #1 was a 96"" or a 120"" tank. He used a drop tube to deliver to tank #1. James went to the cab of his truck to get his tank chart book so when he took a reading after the delivery, he would know the size of the tank.    James heard the sound of the drop tube change. He looked back and oil was running out the top of the fill. He ran back to shut off the trailer. When he shut off the trailer, oil shot out of the tank 4 1/2 to 5 feet high until all of the air was out of the tank.    James went to the boiler room and got the man on duty. Both men got oil dry and spill pads and blocked the storm drain off. The man on duty then called for more help and oil dry. After the oil dry was down, James took the 2"" cap off (he was told you need to have that open to unload). James then unloaded the rest of the load. He stuck the tank and got a reading of 97"". Approximately 200 gallons were spilled.","The tank that was being delivered into was equipped with a remote fill that has thread fittings instead of the standard 4"" adapter fitting. The driver used a drop tube to make the delivery. The vent on the tank was not venting properly and as a result the tank built up back pressure and pushed product out of the fill pipe.    Farm & Home has sent a letter to the School District encouraging them to correct the venting situation and to replace the fill pipe with an adapter so that a current-day 4"" conventional fitting can be used.
