All BNSF employees working in the railyard were moved upwind and away from the chemical odor. The local F.D. was called and their inspection for the possible odor source resulted in no findings. BNSF contractors also inspected rail cars in the railyard for the odor source. Responders reported GLNX 3038 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) as the odor source. A detailed inspection under the valve housing cover after intact seal numbered TBS 299735 was removed, revealed that the chained liquid valve handle (that was removed from the valve assembly) had wedged itself between the liquid valve body and the top of the vacuum relief valve (VRV); which actuated the VRV producing the residue product odor. The valve handle was moved and repositioned within the valve housing area; and the product odor ceased. Afterwards, air monitoring verified no measurable vapor release. No free liquid product was evident. The valve housing cover was closed and resealed with seal numbered SRS 000184. Response was concluded by 1630 hrs. CDT, 10/10/08.

We contacted the shipper and were told that the shipment should be exported as usual.  We then contacted the hazmat packer that was hired by the shipper. The hazmat packer was suspicious because the box that they had packed was not the one we were describing.  The hazmat packer came to our facility and confirmed that the package was different.  We then contacted Michelle Jackson of the FAA (310-725-3741).  The FAA came out and inspected the cartons, where it was discovered that the package contained several 1 qt. cans of paint.

A CSXT Hazardous Materials Manager responded and met the FRA Inspectors to determine source of leak. The leak appeared to be a gasket leaking on either a four bolt blind flange or the four bolt liquid line flanges. Working through EMI, Safety Kleen contacted Specialized Professional Services as a Certified Class G Tank Car Facility to respond to find source of leak and repair. SPSI personnel were unable to determine the exact source of the leak due to solidification of the Flux. SPSI cleaned spilled material from tank car. CSXT Hazardous Materials advised EMI that Safety Kleen would have to secure an FRA movement approval to move the car approximately one mile to the consignee to be off loaded and then sent to home shop for repair.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder immediately inspected FURX 130282. Inspection by the responder revealed that the bottom operated BOV was in the closed position and the primary bottom outlet cap (BOC) was tool tight. The responder cycled the BOV operating handle which slowed the product drips emanating from around the BOC. The responder then removed the BOV operating handle to observe the valve stem closure position, which indicated that the valve was not being fully closed with the operating handle in the closed position. The responder corrected this alignment which enabled the BOV to be fully closed. Once, the BOV was closed, the responder removed the BOC to inspect the BOC gasket. Loose sediment was found atop the BOC gasket which prevented a good quality gasket seal. The inner BOC was cleaned, the gasket was wiped and flipped over; and the BOC was reapplied and tool tightened. Afterwards, (approx. 1745 hrs. PDT, 10/17/08) no further product dripping was observed. All spillage evaporated. Intact seals removed from the top valve housing cover and the BOV were CGL BLAIR 0240257 and 0240258 respectively.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder was notified and immediately started to inspect rail cars for the odor source. The responder reported DBCX 200142 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) emanating a product odor and a liquid stain that originated from under the valve housing cover was observed. DBCX 200142's valve housing cover with intact seal was opened for valve and fitting inspection. The responder found the one inch threaded sample line valve was loose at its threaded connection into the tank car. This was tool tightened. Also, all the mounting flange bolt nuts for the liquid and vapor valves were loose at the base of these valves. These were all tool tightened (8-10 nuts on each valve flange). The liquid and vapor valves packing retainer nuts on the valve stems were also loose and these were tool tightened. All valves were in the closed position. The responder noted that these valves appeared to be recently installed. Non-evaporated spillage around the valve housing was wiped and afterwards no product odor was evident.

The contractor reported that the lading consisted of double stacked palletized and poly wrapped 55 gallon steel drums. No rear end bracing was present, but the lading was stowed tightly against the container's sidewalls and against the rear doors, which left little room for rear bracing. One drum towards the rear of the container was found to be the leak source. This compromised drum had a small crack at the bottom drum ring, possibly from contact with another drum, the container's interior sidewall or damaged prior to or during loading. Other drums inside this container were noted with dents in the drum bodies, but none of these were compromised. The leaking drum was placed inside an 85 gallon recovery drum and returned to the lading after the interior of UETU 207025 was cleaned. The spillage on the outside of UETU 207025 was cleaned along with the ground impact area. Soiled cleaning materials were placed into a disposal drum for appropriate future disposal.

This area in the railyard was cordoned off and rail operations were suspended. A nearby BNSF contract environmental responder investigated the odor source and determined that the source of the odor was amongst seven residue tank cars coupled together that last contained methyl mercaptan. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder arrived and inspected these suspect tank cars. The BNSF responder reported finding ACFX 94864 (DOT 105J300W tank car) leaking residue product vapor from the vapor valve stem with a loose packing retainer nut. The responder tightened this retainer nut by 1610 hrs. CDT, 10/23/08 stopping the vapor leak. Another team of BNSF contract responders using a Photo Ionization Detector (PID) performed inspections and monitoring of all these tank cars finding no other securement deficiencies and no further vapor leaks or odor. Response was concluded by 1740 hrs. CDT and rail operations were resumed at 1750 hrs. CDT, 10/23/08.  The specification stencil on the side of ACFX 94864 portrayed the last tank qualification in the year 2003 and next due in 2013.

CELLUCCI,"VICE PRESIDENT, TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",42 Longwater Dr,Norwell,MA,02061,Carrier,"A vehicle operated by Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc. was en route from a shipper’s location to the intended waste management facility.  During the course of the trip, the driver was forced to execute a hard braking maneuver that resulted in a 250 gallon IBC to slide forward into a pallet jack puncturing the side wall of the container.  The driver immediately pulled into a parking area where he inspected the cargo portion of the vehicle and discovered that approximately 150 gallons of material had escaped from the package onto the floor of the box truck.  The driver immediately secured the vehicle and initiated the spill response plan which included applying an absorbent material on the ground to protect the spread of material.  Once secured, the driver called his dispatcher who dispatched a response crew to the scene.  Calls were made to local police, fire and regulatory agencies advising them of the situation.  Upon arrival, local emergency personnel monitored the scene as the emergency response crew initiated the spill clean-up efforts which entailed absorbing all free liquids with a suitable absorbent material, containerizing all cleanup debris and transferring the material that remained in the damaged IBC into a suitable container.  In addition, the response crew decontaminated the cargo area and reloaded the containers for continuing transportation.  All material generated as a result of this incident was sent for disposal to a fully licensed waste management facility.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT.  NOTE: THIS IS A DUPLICATE REPORT OF E-2008110006 TRACKING NUMBER 460616.  A box truck, proceeding from the point of pickup to the intended waste disposal facility, braked hard in traffic, causing a 250gl tote to shift forward in the  load, striking a pallet jack. A puncture hole occurred in the tote caused by the handle of the pallet jack. The driver immediately pulled off of the road into  a parking lot, donned the appropriate PPE and contained the spill with absorbent material in his spill kit. The police, fire, Illinois Department of  Transportation (report#20081573), and Clean Harbors emergency response team were all immediately notified. The Police and Fire Depts arrived on the  scene but did not participate in the clean up. The emergency response personnel cleaned up the spill with the appropriate absorbent material, packing it  into drums and cleaning up the pavement where the spill had been contained. There were no waterways or drains affected. The truck was loaded with all  cleanup materials and continued to the intended waste disposal facility.","REPORT 1  It was determined that the driver of the vehicle failed to adequately secure and position the materials accepted for transportation.  The driver has been retrained to insure that proper and effective blocking and bracing techniques are used for all future shipments and the devices used must be able to prevent any movement during normal traffic conditions which include hard braking events.  This is to include any supplies and/or equipment carried in the cargo potion of the vehicle.  In addition, the driver has been made aware that a repeat event will result in appropriate disciplinary action.

The operator immediately shut down the operation, secured the truck and put a bucket under the tanker compartment to collect the dripping product.  The truck was then moved to a secured containment area and another tanker truck was used to pump off approximately 5,000 gallons of methanol.  The new truck was then sent back to the loading rack and the operation resumed without further incident.  Upon further examination it was discovered that the leak occurred at an existing 2"" weld on the bottom of the tanker compartment just in front of the rear axel.",IMTT-Bayonne contacted the customer of the product involved to inform them of the incident.

The unloading was only in process a few minutes, driver stated he had only 5 lbs of air pressure in the tank, when the tank ruptured in the shell on the right side of the trailer, approximately half way up the side below the dome lid area. Driver immediately shut down the air pressure and went through the air bleed off process to relieve the pressure in the tank, but the tank continued to drain off until it reached the level of the rupture. Plant employees and the driver responded to the situation by connecting a pump to the discharge line and pumped the product down. Soda ash was put down to neutralize the product.

No active release was observed when TILX 192826 remained motionless. TILX 192826 was cordoned off in the railyard. A BNSF response contractor was called to inspect TILX 192826. This inspection revealed product wetness around the manway nozzle. The manway securement bolts were found to be tool tight. The manway gasket was inspected, repositioned and the manway cover resecured. Subsequent rail movement of TILX 192826 within the railyard observed by the contract responders revealed a small product release visible at the manway cover during movement. The responders concluded that the manway gasket was not sealing properly. The shipper was notified and a shipper responder with a new manway gasket was dispatched. The shipper responder replaced the manway gasket, resecured the manway cover and applied new seals. Response was concluded by approximately Noon CDT, 10/28/08. The removed gasket had the appearance of gasket compression inconsistencies on a portion of this gasket. After the securement was completed, subsequent movements of TILX 192826 in the railyard revealed no further product release.

TMLU 624119 was cordoned off within the intermodal parking lot. The local F.D. and a BNSF response contractor were called. Inspection of TMLU 624119 revealed that the dripping was from the bottom discharge butterfly valve's 3 inch BSP (British Standard Pipe) with closure cap. The four bolt flange of which the closure cap is attached had a loose bottom flange bolt nut which allowed a small amount of product captured between the discharge valve and the closure cap to leak. The flange bolt nut was tool tightened and the product drips ceased. The small amount of product that impacted the asphalt paving directly under the bottom discharge valve was cleaned. TMLU 624119 was out-gated from the intermodal facility on 10/29/08.,Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK INTERMODAL,Steel portable tank,IM101,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4101,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Water Treatment Operators were offloading FSA from the railcar to an onsite storage tank.   This process requires using air pressure, and when one of the operators manipulated the product hose, it disconnected and the railcar starting vented FSA out of the piping located on top of the car.  The Control Room Operator had all non-essential personnel clear the area and at approximately 1310 hours, while the Plant Engineer (Vee Miller) contacted 911 Emergency Services to report a HAZMAT incident with potentially injured employees.  The Control Room Operator notified Corporate Environmental Services, who subsequently made all appropriate notifications to appropriate agencies, including USEPA and CA OES.  DWP employees deployed containment devices and absorbent pillows to contain the spill within the railcar area and there were NO offsite releases of chemical.     Los Angeles Fire Department arrived on site at approximately 1330 hours, deployed their HAZMAT team, conducted decontamination procedures on affected Water Treatment personnel, and transported five DWP personnel to local hospitals as a precautionary measure.  Los Angeles Police Department and DWP Security Services personnel secured the LAAFP perimeter to keep out onlookers and non-essential personnel.  LAFD reported back on the extent of the contaminated area and turned the site back over to DWP and County Fire Department for HAZMAT cleanup at approximately 1545 hours.      At approximately 1600 hours three employees called the LAAFP and requested pickup at the hospital so they could return to the plant and collect their personal effects.  The hospital had examined the employees and released them without restrictions.  At approximately 1705 hours, the fourth employee was released from medical care after First Aid Treatment.  The fifth employee is had some respiratory damage and was hospitalized for three days.      At approximately 1630 hours, LAAFP personnel and DWP ISS Hazmat Cleanup personnel began work on securing equipment and cleaning up any remaining FSA in the area.  Please note that most of the FSA evaporated, while some soaked into the adjacent soil.  County Fire Department representatives were on site and approved of our approach to cleanup the spill.     Key Facts:    Spill of between 2500-3000 gallons of FSA.  Five employees sent to hospital.  Three released after examination, one given first aid and released, one hospitalized for three days due to respiratory damage.  Minor release to water way, but containment immediately undertaken and no damage to any environmentally sensitive areas.  Spill area fully contained with absorbent materials and all drainage channels dyked to prevent any offsite migration.    LAFD HAZMAT and LAPD responded on site to respond to the spill.  HAZMAT cleanup by DWP personnel in progress as approved by LA","DWP investigation indicates an employee tried to adjust or remove 2-inch cam-lock connection in order to stop minor dripping leak of FSA even though the railcar was pressurized to 20-30 psi and approximately half-empty.  Other employees warned the employee in question not to manipulate the fitting; however, it appears he ignored their warnings.  Remedial actions will include potential disciplinary action, additional training and review of existing Standard Operating Procedures to determine if there are any deficiencies.  At this point, all mechanical equipment checks out and was in proper working order at the time of the incident.  Mechanical failure was not a root cause, rather a deliberate unsafe act by an employee led to the release.",Yes,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,4,0,0,15,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,65000,City of L.A.

The release impacted an area inside the trailer and the asphalt under the tractor and trailer.  A contractor was dispatched to perform remediation and cleanup operations.    Upon arrival, the contractor coordinated with state police and established a 1000ft evacuation radius.  The contractor waited on site for technical assistance from the shipper's response team and for more equipment, supplies, and personnel to arrive.  They were instructed by the incident commander to decon and overpack all of the remaining drums in the load.  Using an ammonia solution, the contractor wiped down the exterior of the drums and examined them for damage or signs of failure.  The drums were then staged outside the trailer on visqueen.  Once all of the drums were removed from the trailer, the contractor began placing them into steel overpacks.  The inside of the trailer was decontaminated with the same ammonia solution.  Once the trailer was cleaned, the overpacked drums were reloaded into the trailer.  The contractor then focused decontamination efforts on the outside of the trailer, the tractor, and the asphalt parking surface.  Once all equipment was thoroughly cleaned, the trailer was sent back to the shipper's facility in Baytown, Texas.",,Yes,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,0,0,5,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,30000,Emergency Response and Training Solutions,US,

The driver was traveling in the middle lane and, as he approached the sharp turn, he claimed to have had a right front tire blow-out and he lost control hitting the concrete barriers to the far right and rolling the tractor and tanker. The driver was knocked out and was pulled from the tractor by two unknown persons.  The tractor and tanker caught fire and burned to the ground.  The heat and fire damaged the underpass of Hwy 310 and had to be shutdown. Hwys 310 and 175, at their intersection, was shutdown and will continue to be shut down until repairs can be made to the overpass.  Basin Environmental was called out to handle cleanup duties and subcontracted Holtcher to do the labor.  Some of the fluid, a combination of fuel and water from the roll-over, entered a storm drain under the overpass and traveled to the storm water collection point. This has been cleaned to the satisfaction of TCEQ and is still being monitored by Basin.","We continue to stress vehicle care, proper speed for the situation, and the Smith System driving techniques.

When driver realized he was on the right shoulder, he over-reacted and jerked the wheel to the left. He crossed the lanes and into the medium.  At the time he lost control and had a rollover.  Driver was not hurt in the accident.  He called his dispatch and dispatch called the safety manager.  Safety Manager had an environmental team sent to the scene.

During the loading operation, a fork-lift operator inadvertently punctured a container that had been previously loaded onto the vehicle.  The damage resulted in approximately 20 gallons of the acetone/methylene chloride mixture to escape from the truck onto the concrete parking area and into a drainage collection system.  Please note this drain was protected from allowing material to escape into the environment.  Facility personnel immediately stopped the loading operation and initiated clean-up and remediation activities.  These activities included making proper notifications to facility management and State environmental agencies.  In addition, representatives from Clean Harbors were notified and a formal response was initiated.  An emergency response team was dispatched to the site and proceeded to absorb all free liquids with a suitable absorbent material.  The damaged drum was placed into a suitable salvage container and secured for continuing transportation.  A vacuum truck was dispatched to remove all material and contaminated debris that was released into the drainage collection system.  In addition this drain was rinsed and flushed until direct monitoring equipment showed evidence of no residual contamination.  All clean-up debris and reside were containerized and sent for disposal to a fully licensed waste management facility.","In order to prevent a recurrence the individuals involved in the loading operation were retrained on Clean Harbor's Industrial Truck Guildeines that outline the proper use and operation of mechanical mandling equipment.

Upon arrival they reviewed bills for suspected leaking product and confirm safe entry into trailer.  After opening trailer, they wore appropriate personal protective equipment and entered, identifying that one 55 gallon barrel was leaking from the bottom.  The barrel had been placed on top of a wooden pallet and had freight stacked on top of it.  An unidentified object punctured the drum from the bottom causing a slow leakage that eventually covered about 6-7 feet of trailer floor surface.  The damaged drum was removed and repacked inside a larger secured container for continuation of trip to consignee.  The surface area of the trailer and bottom of trailer where leaking had occured was cleaned of residue before resuming trip.  There was minimal leakage that had fallen from trailer floor, but the ground was cleaned to eliminate residue.","To prevent further incident, better attention should be provided by loading persons.

Personnel evacuated from the immediate area and, to take extra precaution, SET initiated a voluntary evacuation of the building.  Once SET was able toremove the drums from the trailer, it became evident that three more drums were leaking.

When the tank overflowed he was unaware since there is no overfill device or alarm and therefore there was a spill of 1016 gallons.

Attached are the current materials concerning the spill as of today.","We have completed additional training with our driver’s informing them of the situation of the new storage facility at Logan Ag. We have implored them to be aware of the correct tanks and the markings on the tank, as well as the fact that overfill devices and alarms are not present. We have also pointed out that the distance to the storage tanks is far enough away from the unloading area it is impossible to monitor the truck unloading and see the tanks at the same time.  Continued training in this area will be conducted with any new drivers that might come into our employ.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,TRANSPORT DELIVERY COMPANY,US,

It was determined that the liquid by-pass pipe return from the pump was leaking at a weld where the by-pass return pipe passed through the manway of the storage container.  Due to the configuration of the piping and associated valves, only the propane in the pump by-pass return piping was released and dispersed to the atmosphere - approximately 5 gallons.  Emergency response personnel were contacted and immediately dispatched.  Immediately upon arriving and systematically every 45 minutes thereafter, Emergency ResponsePersonnel used combustible gas detectors to check for levels of propane - none was ever detected.  Our transport division dispatched two transports to unload the storage tank, as a precautionary measure and to aid in the accessibility to our plant by Emergency Responders and our two transport vehicles to unload the storage tank.  At 9:30 am the roadway was closed to the general public. The closure lasted approximately 8 hours but was not done as a direct result of the hazardous material.  By 6:00 pm all liquid had been removed from the storage tank and the roadway re-opened.  At that time Highlands Millwright Company flared off remaining propane vapor pressure in storage tank.  Flaring was completed at midnight.

As the locomotive backed onto the main railway from the spur, he stopped on the rail crossing on Martin Luther King Drive.  The stopping agitated the liquid in the railcars and splashed the liquid material inside the car against the top lid of the car and forced the lid open.  The locomotive immediately stopped movement of the cars while still across Martin Luther King Drive and resealed the top manhole of the railcar.  The estimated quantity of release was approximately 10 gallons of material. The release covered an area approximately 15 feet by 10 feet on the railway and road area. The area was impervious road and rail crossing mat.  An EMCO employee immediately began the cleanup utilizing absorbent pads to remove the spilled material from the impacted area.  The pads were properly contained/labeled and disposed of through an existing waste profile.  No reportable quantities of materials were exceeded and there were no injuries or exposures to the general public.  However, the incident was reported to IEMA, LEPC, and the North Chicago Fire/Hazardous Material Department for precautionary reasons because the spill impacted a public roadway.  It is believed the cause of the incident was due to human error.  The manhole on top of the car was opened the day before to collect a manual grab sample of the material for testing.  If the manhole was properly closed and secured/bolted, it would not have opened from the force of the splash.","EMCO has implemented the following additional preventive measures to prevent any future occurrence of this incident:         1. All employees associated with loading and unloading railcars will be notified and will be retrained on the importance of re-sealing and bolting the manway access covers on the tops of railcars.                               2.
