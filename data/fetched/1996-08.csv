THE MAN WAS TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT OF THE PALLET AND APPLIED THE BRAKES TO AVOID THE DRUM.  HE WAS ONLY GOING CRAWL SPEED BUT THE BRAKES DID NOT CATCH AND HE JUST BARELY HIT DRUM WITH FORKLIFT BLADES, THIS PUNCTURING THE DRUM.  HE ATTEMPTED TO SEE IF HE COULD TURN THE DRUM ON ITS SIDE, BUT THE FUMES WERE VERY STRONG AND HE DID NOT WANT TO INJURE HIMSELF.  HE THEN GOT ON THE FORKLIFT AND GOT OFF THE TRAILER.  HE THEN WENT AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE SUPERVISOR.  AT THIS POINT SMOKE WAS COMING FROM THE TRAILER FROM THE PRODUCT, HITTING THE AIR.  DECISION WAS MADE TO DYKE THE REAT OF THE TRAILER WITH SPEEDI DRY AND PULL TRAILER FROM DOCK AND PUT IN YARD.

COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS CONTACTED BY JEFF BROWN, OPERATIONS MANAGER, IN-TERMINAL SERVICES, UNION PACIFIC INTERMODAL FACILITY, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, WHO STATED ONE OF THE CRANE OPERATORS OBSERVED A TRAILER LEAKING WHILE IT WAS BEING REMOVED FROM THE TRAIN.  AS THE TRAILER WAS PLACARDED FLAMMABLE, IT WAS MOVED TO LOT 16 WHERE IT COULD BE ISOLATED PENDING INSPECTION.  TRAILER XTRZ 221851 ARRIVED LOS ANGELES ON THE CHLAX-05 AT 0700 HOURS, THURSDAY, AUGUST 8, 1996. MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE INTERMODAL FACILITY AND FOUND THE TRAILER ISOLATED IN LOT 16.  SEAL CF 531455 WAS REMOVED TO OPEN THE REAR DOORS TO INSPECT THE LADING.  THE TRAILER HAD BEEN CUBED OUT WITH LADING STACKED SOLID ACROSS THE REAR DOORWAY, WHICH DID NOT ALLOW ACCESS TO THE INTERIOR TO INVESTIGATE THE LEAKING CONTENTS.  THE PRODUCT LEAKING THROUGH THE FLOORING AT THE FRONT LANDING GEAR WAS FIELD TESTED FOR FLAMMABILITY AND FOUND TO BURN, INDICATING IT WAS THE LISTED HAZARDOUS MATERIALS THAT WERE LEAKING. ********* CONTACT WAS MADE WITH MR. JOHN DUNMIRE, MANAGER, CONSOLIDATED FREIGHT INTERMODAL OPERATIONS, LOCATED AT THE CF REGIONAL OFFICES IN MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA, AND DEVELOPED THE LADING WAS DESTINED FOR THEIR LONG BEACH TERMINAL.  MR. DUNMIRE WAS ADVISED OF THE CONDITION OF THE LADING AND THE RECOMMENDED PROCEDURE TO LOCATE THE LEAKING CONTENTS.  AS THERE WAS NO BLOCKING OR BRACING IN THE TRAILER, AND THERE WAS EVIDENCE AT THE REAR DOORS THAT THE LADING HAD SHIFTED, MR. DUNMIRE WAS ADVISED THE RAILROAD WOULD NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DAMAGED AND LEAKING CONTENTS.  MR. DUNMIRE WAS REQUESTED TO CONTACT ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSLOADING SERVICES (ETS), THE RAILROAD'S HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CONTRACTOR, AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE CONTENTS TRANSLOADED.  ******** ONCE THE ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE, 2 EMPTY HIGHWAY TRAILERS, KCSZ 211645 AND REAZ 638429, WERE STAGED NEXT TO THE LEAKING TRAILER.  AS THE FREIGHT WAS DOUBLE STACKED THROUGHOUT THE TRAILER, AND THERE IS NO LOADING DOCK TO WORK FROM WITHIN THE INTERMODAL FACILITY, THE LADING WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED BY HAND, AS WELL AS UTILIZING PALLET JACKS, AND A FORKLIFT FOR GROUND OPERATIONS.  THE LADING COULD NOT BE DOUBLE STACKED BACK INTO THE TRANSFER TRAILERS, THEREFORE, AN ADDITONAL TRAILER HAD TO BE UTILIZED. ****** ON FRIDAY MORNING, AUGUST 9, 1996, THE TRANSFER OPERATION BEGAN BY REMOVING THE FREIGHT FROM THE REAR OF THE TRAILER. AFTER THE FIRST LEVEL OF FREIGHT WAS REMOVED, IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE OPERATION WAS GOING TO BE TIME CONSUMING, AS THE PALLETS CONTAINING THE FREIGHT HAD BEEN TURNED AND LOADED SIDEWAYS, NEGATING THE USE OF THE PALLET JACK.  EACH PALLET HAD TO BE BROKEN DOWN AND THE FREIGHT RELOADED ONTO AN EMPTY PALLET BEFORE IT COULD BE MOVED TO THE REAR DOORWAY FOR OFF LOADING.  THIS WENT ON THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE TRAILER. ****** DURING THE ENTIRE OPERATION, THE TRAILER WAS VENTILATED DUE TO THE VAPORS BEING GENERATED FROM THE LEAKING PRODUCT.

THE DRIVER OPENED THE TAILGATE REPLACED AND APPLIED SILICONE TO THE SEAL BEFORE SECURING BOTH THE LID AND TAILGATE. BOTH THE DRIVER AND A SUPERVISOR FOR THE GENERATOR WERE SATISFIED THAT THEY HAD STOPPED ANY LEAKS AND THAT THE CONTAINER WAS READY FOR SHIPMENT. THE DRIVER STATED THAT HE MADE SEVERAL ADDITIONAL STOPS TO CHECK THE CONDITION OF THE CONTAINER AND FOUND IT BE LEAK FREE UNTIL ABOUT EXIT #36 ON I-10.

I ALSO NOTIFIED THAT LOUISIANA STATE HIGHWAY PATROL AND THE LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY BOTH ARRIVED AT THE SCENE. THE STATE POLICE LEFT SOON AFTER ARRIVAL. THEY MADE A DECISION TO PLUG THE LEAKS AND MOVE THE TRUCK TO LARCOS YARD AND TRANSFER THE MATERIALS TO ANOTHER CONTAINER. AFTER COMPLETION OF TRANSFER THE DRIVER CONTINUED TO HIS DESTINATION. TRIAD BELIEVES THAT THIS MATERIAL MAY HAVE CONTAINED MORE LIQUID THAN IT SHOULD HAVE. A LIKELY CAUSE FOR THIS WAS THE FACT THAT THE GENERATOR DID NOT SECURE THE BOX LID AND THERE HAD BEEN HEAVY RAINS THE DAY BEFORE THE DRIVER PICKED UP THE CONTAINER. WATER COMBINED WITH 1,2-DICHLOROETHANE COULD HAVE A NUCLEOPHILIC SUBSTITUTION REACTION CAUSING THE FREE STANDING LIQUIDS TO BE CORROSIVE.
