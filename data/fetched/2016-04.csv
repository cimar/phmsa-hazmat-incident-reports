The operator on top of the rail car opened the manway lid to check the pumping operation and rail car volume.  He called to the operator on the ground to inform him the rail car was reaching capacity and to stop the movement of material.  The operator on the ground was wearing earplugs, thus he did not immediately hear the operator on top of the rail car.  As a result, the rail car was over-filled.  After shutting down the pump and closing the valves, the operators immediately notified the plant manager.  A total of 5 gallons of material ran down the side of the rail car.  Approximately four gallons of material was captured by the spill diversion devices and about one gallon landed on the gravel near the rail car.  The excess material in the rail car was pumped back into the supplemental fuel tank system to allow for outage or room for expansion in the rail car during transportation.  The material in containment devices was also returned to the tank system.  No injuries occurred as a result of the incident.  Heritage personnel acted promptly in accordance with the Contingency Plan, minimizing risk to human health and the environment.  Response time for control and clean up was approximately six hours.  By promptly reacting, this incident did not threaten the environment or human health outside the facility.","This incident was discussed and Rail car Operations training was conducted on April 22, 2016.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,HERITAGE TRANSPORT LLC,US,

The tank car contained 50% sodium hydroxide solution and was shipped from Formosa Plastics, USA in Point Comfort, TX. Upon notification of the leak, PTRA contacted M&M Protection. PTRA Safety Officer and M&M Protection responders arrived on scene at approximately 11:00 hours. After getting additional personnel on scene and conducting a safety briefing M&M sent a team into the area to inspect the car and determine the cause of the leak and attempt to stop the flow of product. By the time they were able to begin stopping the flow the car had emptied all contents. Inspection of the valve indicated that the internal 4 inch bottom outlet valve was locked and sealed in the open position. The secondary 2 inch valve assembly had a threaded cap which was determined to be made of aluminum instead of steel. The sodium hydroxide solution reacted with the aluminum and corroded through the valve cap assembly until the assembly failed and began discharging product to the ground.  Approximately 15100 gallons of product was discharged onto the ground in the PTRA American yard. Remediation efforts are ongoing. The NRC, CHEMTREC and TCEQ were notified of the incident within two hours of being on scene. Formosa Plastics was notified as well.",FORMOSA Plastics is investigating the cause of the failures for the improper secondary valve assembly and the internal ball valve being shipped in the open position.,Yes,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,8000000,PORT TERMINAL RAILROAD ASSOCIATION (INC),US,

WE THEN CALLED A VAC-TRUCK TO COLLECT THE PUDDLE FROM THE CONTAINMENT, AND STAKER'S TEAM WE AUTHORIZED TO PULL SAMPLES AND DO THE EXCAVATION OF THE SOILS AND SENT TO DISPOSAL.","IN THIS SITUATION WITH THIS BEING AN EQUIPMENT FAILURE, WE INVESTIGATED THE VALVE AND FOUND THAT THE PSI RATING IS 75 PSI AND WITH OUR PUMPS AT AN IDLE IS AT 175 PSI.

There are 5 compartments in the trailer with the following capacities (gal.): 1-4,800; 2-1199; 3-1800; 4-3000; 5-3000. The compartments contained the following amount of gasoline (gal.): 1-4700; 2-1150; 3-1750; 4-2900; 5-2900.  At the Y intersection of Pine Lake Road, M-60 makes a left curve. For unknown reasons, the vehicle and trailer left the roadway causing the complete unit to roll over, crushing and ripping open compartment #1 and spilling 4,700 gallons of gasoline onto the ground. The unit came to rest, laying on the left (driver's) side of the vehicle. Additionally, the rollover caused the probe in the dome lid of compartment #3 to be unseated, releasing 717 gallons from that compartment. The Cass County Sheriff Patrol Division was the first emergency responder on scene. Additionally, five (5) fire departments responded to the scene, laying down a foam blanket to mitigate the possibility of ignition. Brenner Oil Company's Safety Supervisor was on-site at 03:50.  The driver was pronounced deceased and the procedure to pump off the remaining product was begun.      The first environmental response company at the scene was Inserv Industrial Services (514 E.

Surveillance video obtained from a nearby business shows the tote slide to the rear and the top to the tote appears to fail underneath the strap before the tote falls from the truck.  We suspect a smaller tote which was being secured by the same strap allowed for the movement    The driver and a nearby Public Works employee began containing the spill.  In approx. 4-10 minutes local police and fire were on scene and had isolated the area.  St. John's County Hazmant Response team was brought in and they applied approx 50lbs of Sodium Bicarbonate to neutralize.  Meantime Hawkins dispatched an employee with a pallet of Sodium Bicarbonate and contacted SWS Environmental out of Jacksonville to respond to the incident.  Hawkins employee arrived first and ad the entire pallet of bicarbonate was used to further neutralize the acid.  SWS arrived at approximately 1300 hrs and began cleanup operations.  Sand and soil were removed until neutral soil was found.  Approx 28 yards in total were removed from the site.  The site was then back-filled with a sand specified by FL DEQ agent on scene. The majority of the clean up operations were completed by 2230  with all equipment and material removed the operation were and the ""OK"" given to SWS contractors around 1530 on 4/22/2016","Hawkins is taking a two fold approach at preventing another incident like this in the future.  We are working with tote manufacturers and reviewing tote storing and handling practices in FL.  The goal is to improve tote performance by limiting UV exposure where possible, while possibly setting a ""sunset"" date for totes used in particular service.     The second method is we are evaluating tote securement practices involving flatbed/stakebed trucks.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Renewable Products Marketing Group, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report 2016-0423-00092).  Marion Environmental Inc. (MEI), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found product leaking from a threaded connection between the tank cars liquid line and the liquid line valve mounting flange.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative (Jason Wojahn).  MEI attempted to tighten the threaded connection, however, it was discovered that inadequate clearance between the liquid line valves mounting flange and a separate blind flange on the tank cars pressure plate would not allow proper securement.  In order to prevent further release of product, MEI removed the tank cars liquid line valve and installed a threaded valve which afforded the necessary clearance for tightening.  Because MEI is neither a certified or registered mobile repair unit, and the valve installed is not a DOT/AAR compliant valve; the car is being held out of transportation until such time as the car owner can arrange the necessary repairs and/or obtain a One Time Move Approval from the FRA.

THE 5TH WHEEL WAS INSPECTED WHEN THE TRUCK WAS DRIVEN BACK TO THE TERMINAL AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE 5TH WHEEL MECHANISM WAS NOT DEFECTIVE OR DAMAGED. RATHER THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE DRIVER DID NOT PROPERLY CONNECT THE KING PIN ON THE CARGO TANK TO THE 5TH WHEEL OF THE TRACTOR. THIS WAS A HUMAN ERROR ISSUE. REGARDLESS FOR PRECAUTIONARY ISSUES, THE 5TH WHEEL WAS VOLUNTARILY REPLACED WITH A NEW 5TH WHEEL.",THE 5TH WHEEL INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS VOLUNTARILY REMOVED AND REPLACED.

They exited off US-69 south of Fort Scott, KS and followed a parallel road: Kansas State Highway 7. K-7 is a lane state highway without an improved shoulder and steep ditches that is primarily oriented North and South. At approx. 0625 a CPCI employee driving a Nitrogen transport at the rear of the convoy was heading southbound on K-7. The tractor was traveling approx. 55-65 mph, when the passenger side rear trailer tires dropped off the roadway into the west ditch. The employee traveled approx. 200 ft. partially off the roadway as the weight of the trailer pulled the rig deeper into the ditch, causing the truck to begin rotating in a counterclockwise direction. The employee attempted to regain control of the vehicle, but over corrected caused the tractor to travel in a perpendicular motion to the intended direction of travel. The high level of inertia in the original travel path shifted the COG, which exceeded the tractors roll over threshold, resulting in the rig overturning and sliding approx. 60 ft before coming to a stop. Based on the skid marks on the road it is estimated that the rig was traveling  40-45mph when it overturned.  The supervisor for the group organized traffic control and the driver assistance in climbing out of the vehicle and contacted 911. During the overturn of the N2 cargo tank, the pressure relief valve was broken allowing free release of N2. The 85 gallons dispersed into the atmosphere relatively quickly, before the arrival of the Kansas Highway Patrol to the scene. Following Kansas protocol, notifications to Kansas City resulted in dispatched emergency responders who had to arrive to release the vehicle. This delay caused the extended highway closure as the tractor trailer lay across the 2 lanes of the roadway. Vehicle was righted, and towed from the scene. Environmental clean-up contractor acting on the behalf of CPCI removed 2-55 gallon drums of Absorbents used to collect motor oil, antifreeze and diesel fuel that dripped from the over turned truck tractor.  The protocols of the State of Kansas prevented trained subject matter experts, who were immediately present, from advising and coordinating removal of the unit from the roadway. This is another example of a significant incident being influenced by subjective factors that were not caused by a release, but only the perceived threat to trained individuals.",1.

The employee noticed a small puddle underneath a pallet. After moving the pallet, the employee identified a small pin hole on the bottom of a drum that was on the pallet. The drum contained a microbiocide and was shipped as UN3265, Waste Corrosive Liquid, Acidic, Organic, N.O.S.(5-Chloro-2-Methyl-4-ISOThiazolin-3-One, 2-Methyl-3(2H)- Isothiazolone), 8, II, RQ(D002). It was estimated that approximately three ounces was released. The spill was cleaned up using absorbent pads which were placed into the salvage drum that the drum was placed into.","The investigation revealed that the material was placed into a newly purchased reconditioned closed head steel drum about one week prior to the shipment. The incident was reviewed with field personnel. Although there were no obvious protruding nails on this pallet, the emphasis was to ensure when placing drums onto pallets to be sure to verify that there are no nails protruding from the pallet prior to placing the drum onto it.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

The Hub Manager was directed to segregate the container from the other containers in the area. A hazmat contractor was called to investigate.  April 22, 2016 0245 am Hazmat contractor arrived on-scene and after getting a situation update from the Terminal Manager proceeded to investigate the container which was still smoking. The Hazmat contractor tested the liquid which leaked from the container and found it to be acidic which agreed with the Corrosive placard on the side of the container. At this point the Hazmat contractor opened the door approximately six (6) inches and then half-way to gain access. Within approximately one minute of opening the door the contents of the container caught fire.  At 0255 am Fort Worth Fire arrived on scene and decided to keep the evacuation in place and let the fire burn until documentation of the container contents was confirmed.  At 0400 am BNSF and Fort Worth Fire decided to extinguish the fire with water and collect the runoff for characterization and disposal.  After the contents were cooled the contents were removed from the container and placed in roll-off dumpsters for characterization and disposal.

WHEN THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER WERE PARKED, THE DRIVER OBSERVED SOLID MATERIAL LEAKING FROM THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER. LMH ENVIRONMENTAL, INC. WAS AUTHORIZED BY GREAT WEST CASUALTY COMPANY, THE INSURER FOR ENGLUND, TO DIRECT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP OF THE SITE.     BACKGROUND     SITE LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION    THE SPILL SITE IS LOCATED ON THE STREET IN FRONT OF 2824 NORTH LOCUST AVENUE, RIALTO, CALIFORNIA. THE FACILITY AT THIS LOCATION IS A TRAILER STORAGE YARD. THE SITE LOCATION IS INDICATED ON THE EXCERPT OF A USGS MAP ON FIGURE 1. AN AERIAL VIEW OF THIS LOCATION DOWNLOADED FROM GOOGLE EARTH IS PROVIDED IN FIGURE 2. A STREET VIEW OF THIS LOCATION DOWNLOADED FROM GOOGLE EARTH IS PROVIDED ON FIGURE 3.     DESCRIPTION OF SPILLED MATERIAL    THE MATERIAL SPILLED AT THE SITE WAS A SPENT CATALYST SHIPPED BY TESORO CORPORATION FORM ITS TESORO GOLDEN EAGLE REFINERY IN MARTINEZ, CALIFORNIA, FOR DISPOSAL. THE USDOT DESCRIPTION ON THE ORIGINAL MANIFEST IS UN3190, HAZARDOUS WASTE SELF-HEATING SOLID INORGANIC, NOS (NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED), (SPENT CATALYST), 4.2, PG II. THE MATERIAL WAS FURTHER DESCRIBED ON THE MANIFEST UNDER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS ‘SPENT NIMO CATALYST.” THIS MATERIAL IS USED IN PETROLEUM REFINERIES TO REMOVE SULFUR FROM REFINED PRODUCTS SUCH AS GASOLINE, JET FUEL, KEROSENE, DIESEL FUEL, AND FUEL OILS. THE PURPOSE OF REMOVING THE SULFUR IS TO REDUCE THE SULFUR DIOXIDE (SO2) EMISSIONS THAT RESULT FROM USING THOSE FUELS IN AUTOMOTIVE OR OTHER VEHICLES, AND IN RESIDENTIAL AND INDUSTRIAL FURNACES. A NIMO CATALYST IS TYPICALLY AN ALUMINA BASE IMPREGNATED WITH A COMBINATION OF NICKEL AND MOLYBDENUM (CALLED NICKEL-MOLY OR NIMO) USED FOR SPECIFIC DIFFICULT-TO-TREAT FEED STOCKS, SUCH AS THOSE CONTAINING A HIGH LEVEL OF CHEMICALLY-BOUND NITROGEN.     CATALYSTS SUCH AS THIS WILL IGNITE SPONTANEOUSLY IN AIR AT OR BELOW 55 C (130F) AND ARE REFERRED TO AS PYROPHORIC MATERIAL. PYROPHORIC MATERIALS ARE OFTEN WATER-REACTIVE AND WILL IGNITE WHEN THEY CONTACT WATER OR HUMID AIR. THEY CAN BE HANDLED SAFELY IN ATMOSPHERE OF ARGON OR (WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS) NITROGEN. MOST PYROPHORIC FIRES SHOULD BE EXTINGUISHED WITH A CLASS D FIRE EXTINGUISHER FOR BURNING METALS.     THE CARGO WAS BEING SHIPPED TO GULF CHEMICAL AND METAL IN FREEPORT, TEXAS, FOR RECYCLING. A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL MANIFEST IS INCLUDED IN APPENDIX A. GULF CHEMICAL AND METAL TREATS NICKEL-MOLY CATALYST AND PRODUCES TECHNICAL –GRADE AND CHEMICAL-GRADE NICKEL-COBALT ALLOYS THAT ARE REUSED IN CHEMICAL AND METALLURGICAL APPLICATIONS BY CATALYST PRODUCERS AND STEEL MANUFACTURERS.     EMERGENCY RESPONSE    THE TRANSPORTER CONSISTED OF A TRUCK AND ONE TRAILER. THE MATERIAL WAS OBSERVED LEAKING FROM THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER BY THE DRIVER WHEN HE WAS LEAVING THE SITE AFTER BEING PARKED FOR DOWNTIME. APPARENTLY","ENGLUND EQUIPMENT COMPANY WILL NO LONGER TRANSPORT COUGAR BAGS OF ANY KIND.
