The immediate supervisor put on a respirator and went in to apply a neutralizer to try and control the spill.  The fumes were still very strong, so the trailer was removed from the building and the fire department was contacted.  Upon arrival at approximately 20:00, the fire department was presented with the Hazardous Materials Shipping Papers for the load, to determine the hazard present.  Infotrac was notified at 20:52 and they contacted the shipper (Seacole) recommending that Bay West Environmental Services be contacted for the clean-up.  Bay West arrived at approximately 01:00 and started the clean-up and the fire department left the scene.  Bay West removed and washed or eliminated any contaminated packages that were in the trailer, then proceeded to wash out the trailer.  The scene was cleared at 05:15.","1.

CARSON ST.,",LONG BEACH,CA,90810,Other-TRANSPORTATION BROKER,"NYK Logistics, acting as a transportation broker, dispatched a carrier to pick up a load of goods on behalf of its customer/shipper, Spectrum Brands.  At the time of order placement by Spectrum, no hazmat commodities were declared.  Pickup was at Spectrum's vendor, Apollo Industries.  Apollo loaded 9 pallets onto trailer and closed trailer for delivery.  Carrier delivered 3 pallets to one of Spectrum's facilities and then 6 others to its final destination location at Spectrum's facility in St. Louis.  Included with the products packed onto the pallets were five, 5-gallon barrels of Gamma55 (as indicated on the BOL provided to the driver by Apollo at pickup).  Upon arrival at final destination and opening trailer, driver noticed that one of the barrels had tipped over and was leaking onto theflooring of the trailer.  After closer inspection, it was noted that the barrel did not have a sealed lid like the other containers; instead it was covered with what appeared to be a shrink-wrap material.  Driver, not realizing that the product could be hazmat as it hadnot been declared such by the shipper or the shipper's vendor, set the drum upright.  He touched the product with his hand and some also splashed onto his face and eye as part of moving the container. Shipper's receiving dock manager responded and placed the driver under a HAZ flush and reportedly also assisted with cleanup of the trailer per MSDS instructions.  Shipper also took custody of the containers and placed in a secured location for inspection.  No one else was injured during this event.  NYK Logistics has requested copies of photos taken at the scene as well as specific information about the potential hazmatreportable commodity (quantities, concentration level, why the one package was sealed incorrectly, etc.).Both Spectrum and Apollo have been fully apprised of the incident and each has advised it is also investigating the incident.","Recommendation to NYK Logistics' customer Spectrum and customer's vendor Apollo to utilize appropriate packaging, labeling and declaration of materials for each and every load.  NYK Logistics will continue to require Spectrum to identify each item being shipped on its behalf and to ensure its vendors understand that all products must be appropriately sealed and labeled prior to shipment.

Hunt Corporate Drive,LOWELL,AR,72745,Carrier,"Improper blocking/bracing contributed to a load shift in transit resulting in a hazmat spill that was detected when the container de-ramped in Portland, OR.  Approximately ten (10) gallons of corrosive liquid, basic, organic, n.o.s. (ethanol amine) Class 8, packing group II was found to be leaking from the container (cofc).  Containers were double-stacked; the leaking container was on top, resulting in corrosive material leaking onto the lower container.  Both containers were taken to the hazmat pit by rail personnel.  Upon inspection of the interior of the container several pallets of hazardous materials were found to have load shifted.  Approximately twenty 5-gallon containers totaling approximately one hundred (100) gallons of ethanol amine were discovered to have spilled, the majority still in the container, the remainder having leaked on the exterior surface of the two containers and on the ground immediately below the containers.  Hazmat contractor was contracted by J.B. Hunt to conduct hazmat containment; contractor dispatched subcontractor to the site to conduct the clean-up efforts.  Photos obtained by subcontractor revealed minimal-to-no load blocking and bracing had been conducted by the shipper; this was the second of two similar incidents involving the same shipper in a span of about two weeks.  Subsequent investigation by J.B. Hunt personnel and by the load consigner, Staples, led to a recommendation to the shipper (Carroll Company) to review their loading practices.",This was the second of two similar incidents involving the same shipper occurring within an approximately two week time span. Both incidents were due to improper blocking/bracing. This issue has been addressed with the shipper and with the consigner; additionally the railroad has begun to inspect shipments originating from this carrier. Shipper has been advised by both J.B. Hunt and Staples how to properly block & brace shipments in the future in order to comply with DOT regulation #177.834(a),No,BAG PLASTIC,Plastic bag (cont1 for solid materials),BAG PLS,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7000,"J.B.

Internal pressure reading at the time of initial inspection was 140 psi and the Midland A-1280 PRD installed atop PLMX 135086 had a pressure setting of 280.5 psi. The side specification stencil indicated that this PRD was last qualified in the year 2007. The responder suspected that deteriorated seat/stem O-rings were allowing product vapor to by-pass the closed PRD. PLMX 135086 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard.

Eagle / SWS discovered the B-end liquid valve open  turn and a less than tool tight secondary securement plug. The leak was secured and the car was monitored for 24 hours before released for disposition. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Thomas McKiernon (228-762-3210).

During the course of the  trip, the driver conducted a routine load check and identified material leaking from the trailer onto the vans axel. The driver immediately place an absorbent material down to absorb the free liquid and prevent the spread of the release. Once secured, he notified his home dispatcher and the manager of the fueling facility where the vehicle was parked. The Greeneville Fire Department was called as was a local emergency response company. Upon arrival the emergency response team inspected the trailer and utilizing appropriate personal protective equipment, entered the trailer and initiated the removal of containers in order to identify the leaking container. It was discovered that 1 55 gallon drum was leaking from the top lid. The crew placed the leaking containers into a suitable over pack and proceeded to absorb and collect all free liquids. This material was placed into the salvage drums along with all materials used to decontaminate the trailer floor.  Once the clean up was complete, the trailer was reloaded and was sent on to the intended waste management facility where the shipment was received and processed for disposal.","At the time the container was accepted for transporttion, no evidence of leaking was observed. It is believed that the drum was overfilled and given the heat that week, expansion caused the container to fail during the course of transportation allowing the material to leak from the container. In order to prevent a recurrence, the individuals that offered the shipment for transportation and the driver in posession of the shipment have been re instructed to ensure that each drum is  inspected before it is accepted for transportation.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2000,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders inspected PVCX 13453. Inspection revealed the leak source was at the liquid eduction line's closure cap. This closure cap was not in a tool tight condition (approx. 1 1/2 turns loose). Internal pressure within PVCX 13453 was reduced and the closure cap was properly tool tightened. Securement was completed by 1040 hrs. MDT, 7/13/2010. Observed ground spillage was neutralized with baking soda.  PVCX 13453 was then moved to an isolated location in the railyard for a contractor to neutralize and wipe off product spillage on the tank shell. PVCX 13453 was cleaned of all product spillage by 1600 hrs. MDT, 7/13/2010.  No further product release was evident in subsequent rail movements of PVCX 13453 in the railyard.   The side specification stencil on PVCX 13453 indicated that its last tank qualification was completed in the year 2002 and next due in 2012.","This was the second similar incident on the BNSF this year involving PVCX 13453.

All required forms were signed off and approval was given to start the unloading process by Tolleson Dairy personnel.  The Dairy operator was on a deck near the top of the tank which was taking the product when he immediately noticed product coming out of the tank connection on top.  The Univar driver stopped the flow of product as soon as he was notified of the leak.  No more than two gallons of product spilled into Tolleson’s Dairy tank containment area.  The Dairy maintenance department was called to investigate the leak and make the necessary repairs before the blend can be re-delivered.  There were no injuries.",It was noted that the product (approximately 2 gallons) had spilled out of the pipe inlet into the top of the tank when the unloading process had started.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a truck stop in order to conduct a load check.  During the load check, the driver identified that a container on the trailer had leaked and approximately 15 gallons of a suspected flammable solvent had puddle on the trailer floor.   The driver immediately contained the release using a suitable absorbent material from the vehicles spill kit.  Once secured, all required notification were made which included the management of the truck stop at which the driver was parked, local emergency services and his home dispatcher.  The driver’s home dispatcher sent a response crew to the scene and notified a Corporate Transportation Compliance Representatives who in turn reported the incident to the TN Emergency Management Agency.  While the emergency response crew was en route, the local fire department made the decision to evacuate all trucks that were parked at the truck stop while the spill was being addressed.  It is estimated that between 175 and 200 vehicles departed the truck stop while the spill was addressed.  Upon notification that this action was taken, Corporate Transportation Compliance notified the NRC and advised that an evacuation of the truck stop had been ordered by local authorities.  Once the response team arrived, the team members donned appropriate personnel protective equipment and entered the trailer.  The leaking container was identified and placed into a suitable salvage drum.  All absorbent material and debris generated from the decontamination of the trailer floor was collected and placed within the salvage drum.  This container was secured and reloaded onto the trailer.  Upon completion of the response activity, the vehicle was inspected and was released to continue on its way to the intended waste management facility.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage of leaking was observed.  In order to prevent a recirrence, the driver and shipper have been instructed to insure that a thorough inspection be conducted on each container as it is loaded and to take appropriate actions should a container with suspect structural integrity be found.",Yes,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,3000,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

While at the Flying J Truckstop in St. George, Utah, a leak was discovered coming from the trailer.  Area was isolated and site was secured.  H2O Environmental of Las Vegas, Nevada was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, free liquid was detected on the asphalt surface beneath the trailer.  Upon inspection of the trailer, one (1) 330-gallon tote was discovered leaking, due to a loose valve.  Approximately 15 gallons of formic acid were released to the trailer floor and asphalt surface.  H2O Environmental neutralized the free product on the affected surface(s), and proceeded to transfer the remaining product into seven (7) 55-gallon drums.  The neutralized product was placed into one (1) 55-gallon drum, and transported off site, pending disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  The seven (7) drums of virgin product were reloaded onto the trailer, and sent on to their destination.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be related to a faulty valve on the tote, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

The leak was secured and the car was released for transport to destination.     This incident did require a special switching move.   No 7.1 will be required for this incident.

When the vehicle in front of our unit came to almost a complete stop, our driver realized he could not stop in time to avoid hitting it in the rear. He could not change lanes as there were vehicles on his left side. So the driver swerved over to the shoulder of the interstate and the trailer swung around to the right taking it into the grass and causing it to roll over. The rear washout cap leaked a steady drip of product and the vapor recovery line fitting was bent at the valve where it turns down at a 90 degree going along side of the trailer causing it to leak a steady drip as well. The leaks were stopped after the tanker was transloaded into another trailer. Both leaks lasted for about 8 hours. The product on the ground was neutralized and cleaned up by the response team that was called out to help with the transfer.",On all non insulated trailers the washout cap piping should be long enough so that a Betz Valve could be used in the event that a trailer needs to be transloaded through a washout.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,200650,Enterprise Transportation,US,

When the trailer struck the dock a drum bolt from an adjacent drum apparently punctured a drum causing a small leak near the top chime. When an inspection of the containers occured a leak was noticed. The floor loaded drums restricting the access to the leaking drum were removed to respond to the damaged container. The container was then placed on it's side to stop the leak. The clean up process began, and the leaking container was placed into an 85 gallon overpack drum. The overpack drum was then sealed and labeled with the appropriate markings for future shipment.",A review of the incident was conducted by facility personnel. It was determined that the open head drum bolts were not positioned properly in the trailer so that the position of the bolts were in the void space. This was the contributing factor for the leaking drum. Additional training will be given to drivers to inform customers how to load drums onto trailers. Drivers will also inspect the loading process performed by the forklift drivers as they exit the van trailer.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Shell Chemical Company was notified via CHEMTREC (Report#2010-07-30-00265). The shipper's representative was contacted, Louis Brzuzy (281-974-7613) at 00:50, 07/31/10. The shipper was advised that CSXT had dispatched emergency response contractor, Specialized Professional Services, Inc. (SPSI), Washington, PA to respond. SPSI personnel advised security seal ""458528"" was intact on the tank car protective housing for the top loading/unloading fittings. They reported the pressure in the tank car was 28 psi and outage was 24.5 inches. The interface between the port for the ""A"" end liquid line valve and its plug was noted to be frosted. SPSI attempted to close the liquid line valve but to no avail. Some of the frosting between the liquid line valve port and its plug was removed allowing the plug to be tightened one (1) to two (2) full turns. Shipper representative Al Deamer (985-507-3384, Al.Deamer@Shell.com) advised CSXT that he would seek FRA Movement Approval to forward this tank car to consignee.     This incident did require a special switching move.  A QA Nonconformance Form 7.1 is required for this incident.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at Clean Harbor’s in transit storage facility bending final deilvery.  WHiel removing the container from the roll-off fraame, a rear seal failed allowing approximatley 2 quarts of liquid to escape from the container onto the vehicle staging area.

Facility perosneel then proceeded to ressecure the rear seal on the container and discovered that the gasket ued on the rear seal was old and needed to be replaced.  Facility peronnel repaired the rear seal and secured the closure device for contiued transportation.  Once complete, the container was delivered to the intended waste management facility without incident and the material was disposed of in accordance with all Federal requirements.","    At the time the driver accepted the container for transport, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed.  IN order to prevent a recurrence, the shipper has been advised of the incident and it has been recommended that prior to sealing the closure devices on a non DOT specification bulk bin that the each component of the closure device is inspected to insure it is in good working order and is free of any defects that could preclude it from operating as designed.

The cause of the derailment was attributed to irregular cross level of track. Included in the derailed railcars was PPRX 55151 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) that derailed on its side; and sustained a large dent and puncture breach near the upper B-end tank head seam. The escaping commodity liquid with vapor from PPRX 55151 ignited and the ensuing fire engulfed PPRX 55151 and a portion of two other adjacent railcars ladened with non-hazardous material. Also, PPRX 55151 came to rest near two unattended BNSF locomotives being used as 'work train power' that were parked in an adjacent siding track. The fire also engulfed both of these locomotives which were later deemed destroyed. Fires were extinguished using fire fighting foam and water by late afternoon on 7/03/2010. The remaining commodity (mixed with foam and water) in PPRX 55151 was removed and placed in Frac Tanks for appropriate disposal.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Transammonia, Inc., was notified via CHEMTREC (Report# 2010-07-27-00035). Eagle/SWS, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the odor was being released from the Pressure Relief Device Valve. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Angie King (813-261-0600). Eagle/SWS personnel dissembled the PRD Valve, removed and cleaned the O-Rings, reassembled the valve, then tested for leaks. Since Eagle/SWS is not a qualified repair facility, the shipper applied for a FRA Movement Approval to forward the railcar onto destination where it will be off-loaded and then inspected by Rescar.

Valve inspection revealed that both liquid valve handles were 1/2 turn from being fully closed with one liquid valve's closure plug not tool tight. There was product icing (auto-refrigeration) around this valve with the loose plug. The responder closed the liquid valves and tool tightened the loose closure plug. The responder also found the vapor valve handle 1/2 turn from full closure with its closure plug tool tight and the vapor valve was closed. After securement was completed, no further product odor was detectable.   BNSF seal numbered 7013022 was applied to the valve housing. Response was concluded by 2239 hrs. CDT, 7/19/2010. EPCX 3332 was held in isolation overnight for observation and since no further product odor was detectable,  EPCX 3332 was released to proceed to its destination 7/20/2010 late morning.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Pressure,105JW,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Bryce was hooking said trailer for a line run.  A very small spot of clear coat was directly under the trailer on the ground.  I had Mr. Fewkes put the trailer to the dock for further investigation.  We discovered a pallet half way up in the trailer with a bottom 5-gallon can crushed due to the weight of the other cans that were stacked on top.  A very small pin-hole leak was discovered and the can was removed from the pallet.  Most likely the can was crushed when the trailer went over a bump in the road.  Several other cans on the bottom of the same pallet showed signs of being stressed due to the weight of the other cans sitting on top.  We rebuilt the pallet, putting the cans the were on the bottom on top so as not to jeopardise any other cans on the remainder of the trip.  There was no way to tell how long it had been leaking but since there was only a small amount of discharge it probably happened on the leg from Salt Lake City to Boise.",My suggestion would to limit the amount of cans stacked on top of each other.

We pulled the bill out and noticed it was Hazardous material and I immediately got in touch with our safety department as well as Chemtrec. I was instructed to not touch the freight until I got instructions as to how to clean upthe substance. Once I received instructions, we proceeded in cleaning up the substance by sweeping it into a salvage drum and placing the leaking bags in the same drum. While we were cleaning up the powder, we noticed the powder seemed to be leaking from the seams of the bags. It became clear this spill was not caused by anyone working at Con-way. The cause of the leak I believe stems from the shipper. The powder was loaded into paper bags and placed onto a wooden pallet with nothing in between to prevent the bags from tearing. It appears the substance leaked onto the trailer floor as it made its way up from Gary, IN to Tomah, Wl.

The driver closed off the rack and called for the terminal attendant to assist in clean up.,Train the drivers to keep their mind on what they are doing and make sure the gallons they intend to load will fit in the compartment they are loading.

The air line hose was connected to the chicago fitting on the air inlet line and the external valve at the rear of the trailer was opened.  The air line was connected to the tractor’s compressor and the PTO was engaged.  The unloader instructed the driver he was ready to obtain the sample.  The unloader went to the acid shack opened the bleeder valve on the product line and was waiting to take the sample.   At the same time the unloader was waiting, the driver then opened the butterfly valve and ball valve on the air inlet line.  The hydro pack on the tractor was engaged and the driver was at the rear of the trailer by the product hose to wait for the product to began moving.  It was then when the product sprayed from the tractor’s compressor.  In response to the release the first butterfly valve was closed then the ball valve.  The air compressor was shut off, the external valve and finally the emergency shut off valve were closed.  With all valves closed product continued to flow from the air line for approximately one (1) minute. Estimated pressure on the trailer at the time of the release was 7 psi.     Plant personnel responded to the release by containing the release from air line into a five (5) gallon bucket.  The product went from a small stream intermediate drip over a 15 minute time span, three (3) gallons of product was collected in the bucket.  Plant personnel diked the released product with absorbent socks and neutralized with soda ash.      Faulty gasket located on the chicago  fitting of the tractor's air compressor.   The connection at the tractor's air compressor developed a leak at the gaskets between the chicago hook up. Further from an operational stand point this was caused because there was not enough pressure in the air line,  the gasket allowed air to pass from the trailer and out the air line which caused the release.","  Training and review of the incident will be conducted with all drivers and maintenance personnel,  part of this review will include inspection of worn gaskets and any issues that can arise from the loose connections.  It will be reinfoced that the conditions  of all gaskets is part of a driver's pre and post trip inspection, they must be changed frequently.  Drivers are given extra gaskets for this purpose.      A policy will be put in place effective immedatley that at all times  spring steel locking pins are to be used on all chicago fitting connections.   These pins in conjunction with gaskets that are in good condition will allow the chicago fitting to have better allignment and ensure a good seal.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4500,K-LIMITED CARRIER,US,

Non-impacted lading was transferred to another suitable container. Intact lading that shifted off their pallets were restacked and secured to pallets and placed inside the transfer container. Absorbent material was applied to the spillage inside HJCU 149454 and sweep into recovery drums which were left inside HJCU 149454 for the shipper's disposal. All the damaged/leaking pails were either bagged/taped closed or placed into overpack drums. These were also stored inside HJCU 149454 for shipper's disposal.

Car only wet on sides and not actively leaking.    Car moved to Notch Track for accessibility for equipment/personnel.  Further inspection by CR's A. Richter, REACT's (Conrail's environmental/emergency response contractor) M. Holon, and Shipper Stepan Company's D. Pratt (EHS+S Admin.) found product residue on top of manway (location of recycling vaccum relief device), in addition to the car's top center and down both sides.  Car had been unloaded by Stepan Co. in evening of 7/29/10 or early morning of 7/30/10; and switched from their facility 7/30/10, arriving at CR's Pavonia Yard for outbound CSXT train.    Manway cover opened (all bolts not totally tool tight) revealing a deteriorated manway cover gasket (garlock style).  Gasket replaced with Viton manway nozzle gasket after conferring with Stepan's D. Pratt (on scene).  All other valves/fittings inspected with no exceptions noted.  Car resecured, decontaminated and okayed for shipping to original destination.    With the car in residue service, it's unclear on how product was noted on top of the manway cover.

As he was nearing the target gauge another Rackman in the area was asked to assist.  When the Rackman hit his target gauge he shut the loading arm liquid valve and asked the other Rackman in the area to close the loading arm valve at the bottom of the loader.  With pressure still on the rail car the Rackman closed the vapor valve on the rail car.  At this time the rail car liquid valve is still in the Open position; this meaning there is liquid under pressure still on the rail car loading connection into the hose. The Rackman then proceeded to release one of the cam-lock quick fit ears on the liquid connection.  At 09:12 on July 31st, 2010 after releasing this cam-lock on the liquid connection, the loading hose blew off the fitting on the rail car.   This incident did not involve failure of the railcar or loading equipment. The operator failed to close the railcar valve prior to disconnection of the liquid loading hose. At the time of the incident, the railcar was parked at an ITC railloading rack. The loading rack is designed with concrete containment routed to chemical sumps which provided 100% liquid spill containment. All spilled product was quickly drained into the chemical sumps to be treated at ITC's wastewater treatment facility. The loading rack was completely washed down to remove any chemical residues. The 190 lb reportable quantity is based on vapor release to the atmosphere.",ITC's railcar loading procedure emphasizes the importance of closing all valves and releiving pressure prior to disconnect. Additional training will be implemented to re-enforce procedure. ITC will consider disciplinary action against the employee.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,75000,"Intercontinental Terminals Company, LLC",US,

Total quantity of T-chlor transferred was 550 gallons. This process was completed the afternoon of 7-20-2010. The Rock totes on T-74 are connected to a manifold on the truck with isolation valves. The totes are equipped with a bottom discharge valve as well.   After the product was transferred into the Rock Totes, the truck was parked in the southwest corner of the property to be utilized the next day. The truck operator did not close the valves on the totes or the valves on the manifold. Fluid began to leak from a two inch cam-lock coupling that connects the tote to the manifold via a two inch hose. On 7-21 -2010, initial discovery of the spill occurred.   Countermeasures incorporated absorbent sand as well as collecting the material with absorbent pads. Ecos Environmental and Disaster Restoration was contacted as well as State and Federal agencies for reporting purposes. Ecos initiated the testing process to determine the areas affected and made preparations for the cleanup process. PH tests confirmed that the material traveled from truck T-74 to the dirt parking area as well as to the drain in the parking area which flows to a retention pond.   Testing of the drain outlet completed by Ecos confirmed that the material had entered into the retention pond. Once this determination was made, the diagram for the storm water drainage was reviewed. The diagram for the retention pond includes a drywell equipped with a pump at the bottom to discharge storm water. Without knowledge of where the shutoff switch was located, the electrical panels were checked to try to locate the shutoff switch.   None of the electrical panels on the Champion property are equipped to shut the pump off. A call was then made to the Contractor involved in the relocation of the storm water drain to determine if the drywell pump was operational, as well as to find the shutoff for the pump. The Contractor was able to verbally describe the location of the shutoff switch at the west end of the retention pond.   The switch was turned off and the 2” pvc discharge line from the retention pond was visually monitored. The drywell pump did not activate after the switch was turned off.","Time-line of Events (prior to, during, and after the incident)   • 6:30 a..m..- Spill was discovered at Champion Technologies Facility in Rifle Co.   • 6:35 a.m.- Employees on site deployed containment and absorbent material.   • 7:00 am..- Safety Rep. for Champion Technologies arrived on location and was notified that spill had occurred.   • 7:10 a.m.- Affected trucklequipment was moved to concrete containment to assess affected area.   • 7:15 am.- Employees removed affected totes and hoses from the truck for further investigation.   • 7:20 a.m.- Regional Safety Rep. and District Manager were notified that the RQ for the product was exceeded.

The release occurred as a result of a communication error between the barge operator and the Hess dock operator.  Due to the communication error, the marine transfer hose was partially disconnected prior to the transfer line being fully drained. During the disconnection process, product flowed through the transfer line. Approximately 2 gallons of residual fuel splashed out of the containment pan and entered the Arthur Kill.
