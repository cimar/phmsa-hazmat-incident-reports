The material was leaking from a small  pinhole in the side of the drum. Further investigation showed that the drum was degraded and  rusty at the bottom near where the pin hole leak occurred. It is estimated that less than 1L of  material leaked from the drum. Veolia employees over-packed the leaking container and cleaned  up the spill.","Veolia Management had a discussion with the Veolia employee who accepted container for  shipment from the customer site. When doing the pick-up the Veolia employee did not see any  significant issues with the drum. Also, the Veolia employee noted while at the shipper/offer site,  the drum was partially loaded onto the truck by the shipper/offer so the employee might not  have noticed some of the degradation on the drum that caused the leaked. That Veolia employee  and EHS also discussed the importance of performing more thorough inspections of containers  before accepting for transportation in the future.   Veolia will be discussing this incident with the entire field services team during the weekly safety  training on 6/3/2020. Veolia Management will emphasize the importance and responsibility of a  thorough container inspection prior to accepting a container for transportation. Also, Veolia will  discuss solutions like over-packing containers or leaving containers on-site if they are not in good  condition to ship.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

They called the yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials/Environmental Officer for the WLE.  I came out to inspect and noticed that the bottom outlet valve cap was wet and dripping.  I made sure the valve handle was fully closed and it wasn't, but even when I moved the valve handle more towards the closed position, it didn't stop the leak.  I slowly loosened the outlet cap and the initial liquid in the cap drained off and the leaked slowed.  I continued taking the cap off since i knew the ball was in the closed position.  Once I removed the cap, I looked up inside the valve and saw that product was getting past the ball valve and dripping out.  The ball looked to be in good condition.  Possibly a bad nylon seal. The pattern of product was about 3/4"" wide.  I checked the gasket in the cap and it appeared to be in good shape.  I reapplied the cap and tightened it and it held.  I had the car set to another track and MarkWest called Enviroserve to transload the car.

The size of the crack in the weld was not visibly apparent because of the location where the leg is welded to the body of the IBC. The leak stopped after approximately 10 minutes due to no vacuum relief on the IBC and it was continually monitored by personnel at the scene including a response contractor. The facility manager transported drums and equipment to the scene and the liquid in the IBC was transferred to 55 gallon drums with no further release or incident. There was no released liquid collected due to the high rate of evaporation. The Louisiana State Police and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality were onsite and indicated they were satisfied with the response and conclusion of the incident.",The poor condition of the roadway may have contributed to the weakening of the weld during transport.

During the unloading, the hose ruptured resulting in a spill. The hose being used for the delivery was high pressure rated, therefore is should have not failed. However, the exact cause of the failure is unknown. The ruptured could have been from vibrations in the pumping equipment, a defective hose, or was miss handled. Once the driver was made aware of the situation, the flow of product was shut off. Next, the driver notified company personnel and the emergency cleanup company was dispatched immediately. The OEPA and NRC were then contacted right after. The contamination was removed by digging the material up and then storing it in two roll off boxes. Also, free floating product was removed via vac truck. The crew utilized fresh water to flush out the materials and to collect any free-floating product. There were also staged absorbent pads and absorbent booms used at the product collection point and left at the property to absorb any further product that may need absorbed. No product was released from the site. The clean-up was completed on June 18, 2020. All product was recovered, and the ground was treated will Micro-Blaze as a precaution. Fresh dirt and gravel were filled back in were the excavation took place. Full tanker serial number is 5HTAM4426Y7H64481, could not fit it all in the section place provided.","The product was release because the equipment ruptured while the product was being unloaded. This will be prevented in the future by doing more thorough equipment inspections before delivering product.

It was determined that two drums had  developed small pinhole leaks. The drums were immediately overpacked into salvage drums. All  material was absorbed and collected by the employees that found the leaks. The ground and trailer  was pressure washed. The water was collected for sampling and proper disposal. It is possible that the  waste contained sulfuric acid which could have caused the holes in the drums. The failure on both  drums was just above the bottom chime. The waste had developed pressure due to the outside  temperature and no more than 1 gal was released from the holes. No other drums from the shipment  gained pressure or showed signs of leakage however, all drums were overpacked as a preventative  measure.",All future waste from this shipper will be packaged in poly drums.

The driver noticed the vapor coming from the rear of the trailer as he was entering an on ramp to the Muskogee Turnpike. There was not sufficient space to safely pull over on the entrance ramp, so the driver proceeded onto the turnpike and immediately pulled over onto the shoulder of the road.  Passenger vehicles also noticed the vapor and called local authorities. The local Sheriff Dept responded to the call as the driver was evaluating the leak. The bottom fill valve was leaking and frozen in place. The driver was unable to stop the leak. The public roadway was not shutdown during the entire duration of the time spent on the shoulder. The local Sheriff Dept stayed on the scene throughout the night and was relieved by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol at 0700 the following morning. The OHP conducted a DOT inspection and put the trailer OOS due to the leaking of hazmat on the roadway.",Our Fleet Maintenance Department is investigating.

His truck, a 2009 Mack GU813, (registered weight of 69,000 lbs), was fully loaded with several hazardous materials in both bulk and non-bulk quantities.  Namely, ammonium nitrate emulsion (in a DOT 412 tank), ammonium nitrate ""prill"", in 2 non-pressure capable bins,  a bulk quantity of diesel fuel (for manufacturing products), and a non-bulk quantity of acetic acid solution. The truck was traveling around 55 mph in heavy traffic.  The roadway is a 6-lane divided road at this point.  The truck, which was traveling in the right hand lane, swerved suddenly to the left, and then back to the right, crossing the lane and going onto the shoulder, and overturning onto the guardrail. In doing so, multiple hazardous materials were released from the vehicle.  125 gallons of combustible liquid, n.o.s. (diesel fuel) was released from the non-spec tank.  This material is on the truck for manufacturing.  The release was due to a puncture in the shell of the tank.  2 gallons of acetic acid solution was released, simply leaking from the lid as the truck lay on its side. 7,000 lbs of ammonium nitrate were released from bins (the bin door was torn off by the force of the accident), and 16,000 lbs. of ammonium nitrate emulsion was released from a DOT specification 412 tank, due to the manway lid being ripped off. In The driver reported later that he felt the rear of the vehicle ""getting loose"".  Examinations done at the scene found 2 u-bolts broken off on the drivers side.  These bolts hold the spring assembly to the trunion.  Evidence shows that one may have broken a short time before, and the other at the time of the accident.

His truck, a 2009 Mack GU813, (registered weight of 69,000 lbs), was fully loaded with several hazardous materials in both bulk and non-bulk quantities.  Namely, ammonium nitrate emulsion (in a DOT 412 tank), ammonium nitrate ""prill"", in 2 non-pressure capable bins,  a bulk quantity of diesel fuel (for manufacturing products), and a non-bulk quantity of acetic acid solution. The truck was traveling around 55 mph in heavy traffic.  The roadway is a 6-lane divided road at this point.  The truck, which was traveling in the right hand lane, swerved suddenly to the left, and then back to the right, crossing the lane and going onto the shoulder, and overturning onto the guardrail. In doing so, multiple hazardous materials were released from the vehicle.  125 gallons of combustible liquid, n.o.s. (diesel fuel) was released from the non-spec tank.  This material is on the truck for manufacturing.  The release was due to a puncture in the shell of the tank.  2 gallons of acetic acid solution was released, simply leaking from the lid as the truck lay on its side. 7,000 lbs of ammonium nitrate were released from bins (the bin door was torn off by the force of the accident), and 16,000 lbs. of ammonium nitrate emulsion was released from a DOT specification 412 tank, due to the manway lid being ripped off. In The driver reported later that he felt the rear of the vehicle ""getting loose"".  Examinations done at the scene found 2 u-bolts broken off on the drivers side.  These bolts hold the spring assembly to the trunion.  Evidence shows that one may have broken a short time before, and the other at the time of the accident.  The driver was transported to a local hospital and received treatment for non-life threatening injuries.  The truck was towed away, and the cleanup effort lasted several hours, keeping the road closed.  All hazardous materials were confied to the roadway.","We are looking at our preventative maintenance program, and specifically developing service intervals for suspension parts, body mounts, etc (some items that may cause a sudden loss of control accident).

He determined it was Muriatic Acid (the only chemicals on the truck) and contacted his office.  While preparing to contact emergency response a State Police vehicle pulled in to assist.  They contacted LA Hazardous Materials and helped to get the truck off the road and had him park at that weigh station at I10-W at LaPlace in St. Charles Parish.  Ideal sent another tractor and trailer with a lift gate to assist if necessary.  This truck also had a pallet of soda ash if needed for neutralization.  A representative from Ideal also came to the scene.   Ideal called US Environemental Services (USES) to stop the leak and clean up the spill.  The state sent in a sand truck to use for containment if needed.  Brian Lash,Environmental Scientist III with LDEQ also came to the scene.   USES climbed into the trailer to mitigate the spill while waiting on the fork truck order by LA Haz Mat.  The tote had leaked below the break in the container and the leak had stopped.  They removed the rest of the material from the tote at first by pumping and then by gravity.  When the forklift arrived the empty containers on the rear of the trailer were removed and decontaminated.  The full containers were then removed and decontaminated and placed on the second trailer.  The cause of the spill was determined to be that the aluminum frame broke and punctured the poly bottle of the tote.    USES then began to neutralize the spill with soda ash.  Soda ash was sprinkled on the spill and then swept up and contained.  The Haz Mat team and LDEQ determined that no other action was needed and everyone left the scene.",This product was supplied to us in the package it was shipped in.  Due to COVID 19 the warehouse has been closed since the NOLA shut down with limited attendance.  Inventory sat idle for several weeks. These totes were moved to get them to a customer.

The puncture was-2-3""'s in length. The tote was tilted by the pallet jack to shift the level of the product in the tote away from and below the height of the puncture to stop the leak. The majority of the spill remained on the trailer and in the parking lot at Crown while some did drain into the nearby storm drain. The New Breman Fire Dept. and the Auglaize County Emergency Management Chief was on seen to assist. We contracted Clean Harbors at 5:15 pm for HazMat clean up which continued throughout the night and next day.",Corrective action internally is to review the incident with all drivers and loaders and re-tain drivers and loaders on cargo securement and proper use of straps and the etrax system.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,42550,PVS NOLWOOD CHEMICALS,US,

MANAGER OF SAFETY COMPLIANCE,"200 Galleria Parkway SE, Suite 900",Atlanta,GA,30339,Carrier,"On June 20th 2020, a semi truck tanker operated by Energy Dispatch , was delivering diesel fuel into an under ground storage tank at Race Trac location #2515 121 North Saginaw Boulevard. The delivery driver filled 1 tank at the location . The tank had more than enough uliage to hold the delivered gallons according to the automatic tank gauges that were utilized for this transfer. For unknown reasons, an API Junge valve began allowing Bio diesel product to pump from another tank being filled , and subsequently, said tank was overfilled. Approximately 60 gallons of fuel leaked out onto the concrete apron. The delivery driver immediately attempted to contain the spill to the immediate area with absorbent pads, snake and granular absorbent material . Approximately 5 gallons of fuel did manage to leak past the drivers efforts to contain, and entered a nearby storm drain catch basin . Energy Dispatch immediately dispatched a remediation team to handle the clean up the fuel release.",It was found that the delivery driver followed all procedures and protocol during this transfer of product. An unforeseen programming failure of a Junge valve allowed too much product to pump over from another storage tank to the delivery tank. The operator believed the tank in question had more uilage than their actually was. It is recommended that Race Trac store maintenance advise any carrier delivering to this UGST to be aware of the actual uilage of the tank with space for the product being pumped in from another tank. The carrier will ensure drivers are trained how to quickly respond to spills using provided spill remediation kits.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,15446,Energy Dispatch,US,
