THIS 7 LOT SHIPMENT WAS PLACED IN A RECOVERY DRUM BECAUSE OF THE APPARENT FAILURE OF THE PACKAGING. THE OUTER FIBERBOARD BOXES WERE CLEARLY MARKED AND LABELED AS A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. PROPER CERTIFICATION DID ACCOMPANY THIS SHIPMENT. IN ADDITION, THE PACKAGE SPECIFICATION IDENTIFICATION MANUFACTURERS SEAL WAS OBSCURED BY A LOT LABEL.
