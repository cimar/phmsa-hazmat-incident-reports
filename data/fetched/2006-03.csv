Apparently while the driver was travelling a mist was coming from the area of the crash box that was sprayed down.  The mist affected the tanker and a vehicle that was following behind the tanker.

On 03/20/2006 a drum was found to be leaking by an OES employee while the drums were located at the OES in-transit facility in Baytown, Texas and still in route to the destination facility.  The steel drum had become corroded along the sides of the drum at the top.  The contents of the drum were corroding the metal drum from the inside forming a sort of ring at the top where holes eventually formed.  These holes were less than 1/8 of an inch wide.  Liquid material had leaked out of the container, on to the floor of the trailer, and on to the ground.  The drum was immediately placed in a plastic slavage container.  All of the spilled liquids were collected with inorganic absorbent materials.  All contaminated soil and contaminated absorbent materials and any PPE used during the clean up were collected and placed in the same plastic salvage container.  OES employees estimate that approximately 2 gallons (16 pounds) of material was released.","OES has contacted the shipper of the material to inform them of the spill, to determine if the material in the drum was not as described on the shipping manifest, and to see if the drum should have had a liner or have been constructed of another material that would have been compatible with the contents.  The shipper will be informed that future shipments of this material will need to be corrected so that this does not happen again.",No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

The container that leaked was one of 27 similar containers and, as the investigation would later reveal, incurred a small puncture when it was loaded into the vehicle. The puncture was at the base of the container and permitted all of the contents to leak out, with only one of the five galons being recovered.     The release lasted approximately an hour or so. Upon discovery, approximately 0ne gallon of the liquid was recovered using spill control supplies available in the vehicle.     The cause of the puncture that lead to the release was identified as a protrucdig piece of metal near the along the floor of the transport vehicle. To eliminate the risk that a similar future incident might occur, the metal protrusion in question was eliminated.","Future similar incidents can be eliminated by carefully inspecting the interior surfaces of the transport vehicles to identify and eliminate any potential hazards, such as the protruding metal.

He walked back towards the tanker to adjust the hose to get a better fit and instinctively opened the tanker valve.  The driver realized his error and closed the valve, but gasoline had left the tanker and leaked out of the improperly secured hose fitting.  The release lasted no longer than 2-3 seconds, but approximately 3 gallons of gasoline were released to the concrete surface.  The driver then took spill pads from his truck and cleaned up the spilled product.  No gasoline left facility.  The spill pads were brought back to the terminal and placed in a drum for disposal.","Responsible driver has more than 10 years experience delivering gasoline in tanker trucks and was well trained in proper unloading procedures.

The driver immediately stopped the vehicle, and contained the release.  He then tightened the rear dome hatch and inspected the remaining 2 covers.  The driver, with the assistance of on-site personnel absorbed all material released and containerized for disposal at a licensed disposal facility.  In addition, a field service crew was dispatched to the scne to remove the staining from the facility driveway and to dispose of the containerized debris.","An internal investigation was conducted and it was discovered that the driver did not inspect the rear dome hatch prior as he was preparing to depart the loading facility.  The driver indicated that he had not inspected the rear hatch before departing as he does not normaly use this opening for loading/off-loading operations.  It was also discovered that the trailer had recently been to a tank wash and the rear hatch was not completely secured.

Exxon Mobil personnel applied absorbents to the affected asphalt area and placed a bucket underneath the leaking area of the tanker to contain the free liquid.  Slay Transportation Co., Inc. dispatched a new tanker to the scene for product transfer.  No injuries or exposures were reported.

Product was neutralized with soda ash then removed and properly disposed by ERS.  Trailer was rinsed off at unload site before returning to K-Limited terminal.","K-Limited has three trailers in this application hauling spent and fresh sulfuric acid.  We have implemented a weekly maintenance program to be performed by the K-Limited maintenance department.  A checklist has been developed to give a step by step procedure for performing preventative maintenance and safety check by the shop personell.  Also, only most qualified K-Limited drivers are trained in this application.  New training is also being performed to instruct drivers proper safety checks before each trip.  These steps are now standard operating procedures.  K-Limited has performed this daily multi-load, averages 4 to 6 rounds per day, since 1997 with no maintenance incident of this type.

(SML) CFS facility via motor vehicle with freight container/chassis attached (non-SML truck/driver). Upon the opening of subject unit, it was observed that there was a white powder substance on the unit floor just beneath one of the pallets of cargo. At that time, SML loading personnel informed the driver of the situation and asked that he contact his management.     While waiting for a response from the shipper, SML management made the decision to call an environmental response contractor to perform remediation of the spill. The contractor, SWS, arrived within the hour and transferred the source of the spill (one damaged bag) into a salvage drum. Once the drum was sealed and labeled, SWS departed the scene and stated that the salvage drum would be picked up the following day. The shipping papers were corrected to reflect the removed package by the shipper and faxed to our personnel for shipment.    3/16/06: Salvage drum was picked up by SWS and delivered back to their facility for proper disposal.

The storage tank is located inside a plastic containment dike.  The driver was working with a GE representative to service test a recently installed high level detection device. The tank was filled to a higher than normal level in order to complete the test. Once it was recognized that the detection device was not operational, the transfer was secured leaving about 50 gallons of freeboard area in the 550-gallon tank.  To complete the transfer process, the driver cleared the unloading hose through the loading line and into the tank. Air from this process caused the acid to start splashing around within the tank. The splashing caused approximately 10 gallons of material to flow out of a cracked-open manway into the secondary containment with a small portion spraying beyond the containment to a nearby concrete wall.  The driver immediately stopped the line clearing process while he and a GE representative began washing down material that had sprayed onto the wall. An internal spill report was completed and the incident was reported to management.  There were no injuries or personnel exposures resulting from this release. Neither the tank truck nor the GE Storage tank failed.","The cause of the release was related to the following: 1. ) Manway loose on top of tank, 2. Failure of recently installed high-level detection device, and 3.) Filling tank beyond desirable safe limit. Corrective actions include: 1.) Secure the manway on the storage tank sine a 4"" atmospeheric vent is already installed on the tank, as well as evaluating if there are other storage tanks with a similar problem, 2.) Investigate and correct the failure mode of the high-level detection device, and 3.)

The leak was patched and the product was returned to G.E. Mt. Vernon. After a investigation of the incident, it was determined that during a wash—out, following a previous load, a large amount of pressure and heat was applied to the tank which shocked the tank and caused rapid expansion.

Driver was dispatched to investigate the leak and found that liquid was weeping from the safety relief valve.    Driver commenced offloading material from the tank car, and the safety relief valve reseated and ceased leaking.  After approximately an hour of offloading material, the driver checked the dome area for leaks with litmus paper and found none.  Tank car was moved to our facility for further offloading and repair.      Initial investigation into the cause of the leak seems to indicate that the tank car may have been overfilled, and expansion of the liquid due to temperature may have caused the relief valve to lift.  After the tank car was emptied and degassed, a mobile repair crew removed the safety valve to determine if there was any contributing damage.  None was found, so the valve was reinstalled and its o-rings replaced.  Corrective actions are being pursued with the supplier at this time.

Roadway is a two-lane highway, with one lane for each direction of vehicular travel. It was dark and raining. Our driver perceived that a vehicle, later described as a pick-up truck, was over the centerline of the highway coming toward our vehicle in our lane of traffic. Our drive attempted to slow down and pulled to the right side of roadway onto berm area which was basically lined by a ditch line with adjacent field. Our unit traveled partially into the ditch line and our driver corrected and pulled back onto highway and then again onto the right berm a:rea; noticing that the trailer portion of our tractor trailer combination was being jostled around behind him. Just as driver came to rest on the right berm area, along the grassy area adjacent to the ditch line the wet ground gave way, into the ditch, and the vehicle rolled over onto its right side. Our Company personnel responded, as did the Ohio State Highway Patrol and the loca[ Cleeicreek Fire Department. The Ohio State Highway Patrol closed St. Ri. 122, at points adjacent to the accident scene in order to provide a safe area to remediate the accident situation. Our remedial activity consisted of our personnel responding to site, determining status of equipment and commodity being transported. it was noted there was no evidence of product spillage; but the unit was resting on the right loading/off- loading side of the trailer and that we would have to manually create an opening in trai][er barrel in order to evacuate the product from the vessel. After securing area, our personnel proceeded with drilling holes into the side barrel of tank trailer; inserted hose into said openings and used the product pump from a second transport unit that we had dispatched to the scene. The product was pumped out of the wrecked unit onto the additional unit we had brought onto the scene. The services of a wrecker company were utilized to upright our “wrecked” vehicle and to then transport the tractor-trailer units to respective repair facilities. The entire process was overseen and observed by the personnel from the Ohio State Highway, Patrol and the noted fire departments and all parties were satisfied that no product spillage, of any kind, had occurred either as a result of the accident or from the off-loading and removal of the unit from the accident scene. The trailer and all operating components retained structural integrity throughout the incident with no escape of product onto or into the area.

It is unknown why the driver of the dump truck did not see the warning signals flashing at the railroad crossing and the train crossing Hwy 7; the dump truck did not appear to decrease highway speed when he struck the train. The impact caused the derailment of four hopper cars, all but one was loaded with ammonium nitrate fertilizer. Approximately 30 tons were spilled in the incident and one fatality. There were no avacuations, any other injuries, any direct environmental threat, but Hwy 7 was closed for approximately 36 hours.    Police and the fire department were called to the scene. Contractors immediately began to upright railcars, repair the railroad track and cantilever crossing devices and vacuum the pellets of ammonium nitrate. The impact of the dump truck striking the side of the hopper caused a three feet by three feet gash and forced open the top hatches and one gate of the car.

Stopped off the side of the roadway.  Got out to investigate.  Found a stream of liquid coming from the rear of his trailer.  In an attempt to stop the leakage, the driver used his shirt to put in the cracks at the rear trailer door, prior to calling the safety department.  2 fire trucks, DOT officer: Ofc. Mallahan, 2 local police, 2 Highway patrol, 1 Chief of Fire Department:  Casey (JE) Wright with the Manchester Fire Department. LERC Chad Pardin at the scene.  NRC contacted today, after discovering injuries.  Report #791432, Ms. Johnson.  This was an un-caged tote, nothing to secure it from outside punctures.  Highway patrol went to hospital because some of the liquid was discovered on the bottom of her shoes.  The driver was checked out and released same night with minor chemical burns, that as of today appear to have healed very well.  MSDS was faxed to all agencies involved.  It is understood after investigation the strap let loose while in transit allowing the tote to roam free in the trailer as it was the only object left to deliver.  The tote made it's way to the rear of the trailer where it received a puncture hole, had a cage been surrounding tote, this probably would not have happened.

Mr. Thompson hooked up hose to the on site transfer pipe and hooked up the hose to rail car at 13:15HR and turned on the pump to begin the transfer.  Our Liquids Lead operator Dennis Morgan noticed product was released on the sides of rail car and on the ground.  There is no containment for railcar unloading facility.  The spill response contractor was called upon at 13:30HR and they were on the site to begin recovery of the contaminated soil and to clean the sides of railcar.  Mr. Thompson was tested for drugs and the results were negative.    The results of Investigation:    The liquid foreman determined that there was no gasket in the transfer hose.  Mr. Thompson made statement that he agreed that there was no gasket at the connection and he made a mistake.  He assumed that the gasket was there.  The gasket was found to be with the cap at the later time.  Mr. Thompson has been employed since April 2000 and has been an excellent operator.  At the time of the incident he was working along with more experienced Liquids Foreman Mr. Dennis Morgan as part of the terminals reorientation process for employees who have not worked recently in the liquid yard.    The site was cordoned off the rinse water were collected in separate totes and dir was removed.  All the soil and rinse water are analyzed by a certified laboratory.  Our consulting engineering group is working with State agency to assure that proper care is taken to remove the contaminated soil and waste water and soil are disposed of manner that meets all the local and other regulatory requirements","Recommendation to Prevent Recurrence:    * Initiate a project to provide containment for this product at the rail off lading facility.    *  Consider discontinuing the storage and handling of CCA.  If the decision is made to continue handling the product., adequate containment must be installed.    *  It was not determined if the camlock fitting has been shimmed to compensate for a worn out gasket.  There should be no reason to shim equipment used in CCA transfers-if the camlock unit is not working properly it should be repaired or replaced.    Corrective/Investigative Actions:    Action by Tony Habersetzer, Terminal Manager: Take appropriate retraining/discipline action in regards to operator Thompson, Due date 31, March 2006.    Action by Tony Habersetzer:  Prepare written procedures for CCA rail transfer operations,  Emphasize that shim is not to be used for CCA or other noxious chemical transfers.  Consider use of new gasket for every transfer, Due Date 31 March 2006.    Action Rich Arrasmith: Senior Area Manager:  Review the CCA contract with the customer.  Determine if CCA should be discontinued, or if it is more appropriate to make the investment for proper CCA transfer facilities.  Due date: 31 March 2006.    Action Tony Habersetzer:  Discuss this incident at the next safety meeting from a lesson learned perspective.  Ensure that terminal training program emphasizes the importance of ensuring transfer hose gaskets are in place and in serviceable condition.  Emphasize each employee is taking time to each job is done correctly.

Upon my arrival at Joliet Yard, I walked out to the south end of North-6 where the car was located and noticed that indeed the subject car (GATX with a load of Hexene which is a Class 3 Flammable Liquid UN 2370) was leaking from the valves on top of the tank car at a rate of one drop every four to five seconds (it was now 12:23pm). I contacted S.0. Benaviades at 12:30pm and asked him to have the tracks locked out.  Hal Ratton from Equistar (who had been called earlier) arrived at the scene with his hazardous response team at 12:50pm and verified the leak at 1:11pm after the car inspector had the track locked out.  He then had a job briefing with his team near the South End Yard Office and then went back out into the yard with his team at 1:45pm to start repairs on the subject car. At 2:05pm he informed me that all repairs had been made and that the car was OK to move.  He stated that the cause of the leak was loose plugs on a sample valve. Joliet yard operations sustained a delay from 10:30am until 2:05pm as a result of this incident.",,Yes,TANK CAR,Pressure,105A,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,0,EJ+E RR,US,

While in route, we requested through our communication center that the trucking company seek another vehicle for offloading and a clean up contractor to be made available and on standby. Too, we requested additional H.AZMAT Technicians from Summit County, as no other Colorado State Patrol HAZMAT Technicians were available. Upon arrival, I observed a tractor/DOT 412-tank type vehicle, parked on the Port property, near the Port office. I was unable to view any material leak from our position. Prior to our arrival, the Port office had been evacuated, a protection perimeter put in place and secured. Next, I was approached by Brian Cales, and identified himself to me as the driver of the vehicle. He informed me that the product was a 28% solution of Hydrochloric Acid and the vehicle had lost approximately two quarts of product. We re-positioned ourselves to a closer vantage point to observe the vehicle. We moved upwind and west of the vehicle; approximately 200 feet away from the vehicle, from there, I was able to observe the tank and its leak. It appeared the leak was coining from the rear and bottom of the tank, near the valving area. It appeared that the container had lost approximately five gallons at the time. Barnes and I consulted our resource materials for known hazards and reactivity with other substances we could possibly use to contain the substance. The nature of the product required that entry be made in level B protection (with SCBA). We also requested a load of sand material from CDOT be on standby and available to cover the product (NIOSH/ ERG) if needed. I coordinated with Barnes and it was decided that we would make an initial assessment entry, once a decontamination area and supporting technicians were set up and on location. Once in place, we made entry at approximately 1521 hours along with Sgt. A. Driscoll. During entry, we brought a plugging kit, wrenches, and a containment pool in hopes of stopping the leak.","THIS WAS A INNER LINER TANK FAILURE!  THE TANK WAS STILL IN COMPLIANCE FOR TANK INSPECTION!
