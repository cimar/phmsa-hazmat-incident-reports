KCS Environmental + Hazmat Department dispatched emergency response contractors to investigate.  Local emergency responders, the Louisiana State Police (LSP), and CHEMTREC were all notified.  Local fire department emergency responders arrived, assessed the area but did not locate an odor, and subsequently demobilized from the site. Upon arrival, LSP and the response contractor detected a slight chlorine odor emanating from AXLX 1730.  During investigation, the B End Liquid Valve was found to be in the open position, one and one quarter turn open and the secondary closure plug was loose. The valve was secured (closed) stopping the active leak and the plug was secured tool tight.  Additionally, as information, both vapor valve secondary closure plugs were found to be less than tool tight and both liquid valve secondary closure plugs were found to be less than tool tight. The protective housing lid was found in the closed and secured position, with shipper (un-loader consignee)  seal in tact.  Once secure, the response contractor decontaminated the protective housing and reassessed to ensure the leak had been stopped.     File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. Contact Shipper and consignee for scale weight availability.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

Further inspection of valve revealed that packing nut was found tight and bottomed out allowing for a loose condition of the valve operating rod.  Closing valve stopped flow of material leaking from above valve/flange.    Car was found leaking at a rate of approximately 25 gallons per minute.  Unknown as to how long valve had been in above condition. It did appear as if most loss occurred at the leak site.      Pans were placed under the leaking car to prevent additional ground contamination.  Once the valve was closed, the remaining fuel was pumped from the tank by Locomotive Service Inc.

A BNSF mechanical responder reported the BOV operating handle was in the closed position. The responder tool tightened 3 of 4 flange nuts at the BOV's outlet nozzle flange connection. Afterwards the commodity dripping ceased. BNSF 880612 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard over containment for additional monitoring. On 3/05/2015, BNSF 880612 was observed dripping at a slow rate and the aforementioned flange nuts were re-tightened which ebbed the dripping. On 3/12/2015 no active dripping was observed but arrangements were made to transfer the commodity from BNSF 880612.

The area was immediately secured and M&M Protection, LLC was dispatched to investigate the cause and secure the railcar.  Upon arrival M&M found that all manway bolts were loose, no security seal was applied to the manway bolts and no gasket was installed prior to shipping the railcar.  M&M installed a shoulder gasket, closed and secured the manway and applied a security seal. The car was then moved to a storage track where it could be decontaminated. M&M used a microbug solution, Pure Green, applied with a pressure washer under heat to decontaminate the product on the sides and top of the tank car. The scene was cleared at approximately 10:30 AM.","The shipper, Eighty Eight Oil, LLC, was notified of the incident and directed the PTRA to the loader of the car, GBW Railcar services.

Absorbent pillows were used to remove the spilled material. There was no safety issue or environmental impact from the small spill. Further investigation found only one drum had leaked and the cause was a loose bung plug. The other 11 drums were checked and also found to have bung plugs not adequately tightened. The bung plugs were all tightened prior to leaving Guardian Industries Corporation. The final destination for the MCT was Chemsolv, Inc. 120 E. Mount Gallant Road, Rock Hill, SC.

The corner of the wood pallet pierced / sliced a 3 inch hole in the lower corner of this tote. This particular tote didn't have the metal around the bottom corners to protect it against being struck by objects. There was a significant release based on the location of the damage that occurred to the tote (bottom corner). Once the area was secured, the hazmat was properly identified and the spill was contained using on site spill control products. The SDS data sheets were reviewed and the spilled product was properly placed in recovery drums along with the used spill control supplies. The drum will be properly disposed of by contracted regulated hazardous waste carrier.","This particular IBS plastic tote only had the aluminum cage / bars on it, it didn't have the corner protectors (metal and or hard plastic). If this tote had the corner protectors on it wouldn't have been pierced by the wood pallet of freight that was being loaded onto the same trailer next to the tote. The employee who damaged the tote was properly disciplined and given refresher training.     In my opinion the IBS plastic totes need to been designed better to have the capability to withstand greater wear and tear especially on the transportation end. All of the plastic totes should have the protected metal corners, the cage bars don't protect the corners, which are the spot to be most likely damaged during the loading & unloading of freight that is on the same trailer.",No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3000,"BSP TRANS., Inc",US,

The shipments were (at that time) comprised of multiple cans of aerosol suntan lotion packed into retail display boxes, stacked on a wooden skid and completely covered with opaque, black plastic shrink-wrap, hiding the contents. There were a total of 1152 aerosol cans on the skid. Cause of damage is unknown. There is speculation that the shrink wrap was not as tight at the bottom of the skid, causing a box of the aerosols to shift while in transit and partially slip out from underneath the black plastic. When the skid was removed from the truck, it is believed cans slipped out and three cans were crushed. Contents lost is described as 22.5 ozs.There are a total of 5 skids of this freight sitting in the DG area at DHL Express, all completely enclosed by the black, opaque plastic shrink-wrap.

The cause of this derailment was attributed to a load shift of steel pipe on a bulkhead flatcar that subsequently fell off the flatcar. Tank car UTLX 201252 derailed on its side and commodity released via its Midland 75 psig set reclosing pressure relief valve (PRV) that became stuck in an open position due to damage to the top portion of the PRV.  BNSF and contract responders were able to close/reseat the PRV which ended the commodity release from UTLX 201252. The remaining commodity within UTLX 201252 was transferred into tank trucks on 4/06-07/2015. Afterwards, UTLX 201252 was cleaned and purged of hazardous material.

Investigation into the odor source concluded that residue tank car PPRX 28544 was emanating a commodity odor. PPRX 28544 was isolated in the railyard. BNSF and contract responders reported that 2 of 6 manway securement eyebolts were not applied (hanging downward) and the other 4 securement eyebolts were loose (eyebolt securement nuts not tool tight). Responders opened the manway cover to inspect the manway gasket condition and the applied manway gasket was deemed serviceable.  The sealing surfaces of the manway cover and the manway gasket were cleaned to ensure a good closure seal. The manway securement eyebolts were properly positioned and their eyebolt nuts tool tightened. Afterwards, no further residue commodity odor/vapor was detected and this was confirmed by the responder's Multi-Rae VOC meter.

THE DURATION OF THE RELEASE WAS LESS THAN ONE MINUTE AND WHEN THE OVERFILL WAS FOUND, THE DRIVER TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO SHUT DOWN THE PUMP AND ALL THE VALVES IN THE SYSTEM. THE DRIVER AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PLACED ABSORBENT MATERIALS IN AREAS TO SOAK UP THE PRODUCT AND KEEP FROM DRAINING ADDITIONAL PRODUCT ONTO THE DIRT.","To prevent this from happening again in the future we have done three things:   1. Instructed our dispatch department to ensure the amounts they dispatch will fit in the tank.  2. Retrained our drivers on the procedures for pumping off a load of fuel, which includes determining that the load will fit before they begin pumping off the fuel.  3. Improved communications between the tank owners, our drivers, and our dispatchers.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the transfer operation, it was discovered that approximately 1 quart of material had  escaped from a crack near the top of the container.  Upon examination of the drum, it appeared to have built up pressure to cause a small crack in the drum.  Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised  container into a suitable salvage drum. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and  placed into the salvage drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed. Drivers will continue to inspect each container during staging period as well as before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity.

A PLANT LAB TECHNICIAN WAS ASSISTING A DELIVERY TRUCK DRIVER IN OFFLOADING A ROUTINE TRUCKLOAD OF SULFURIC ACID TO THE COOLING TOWER SULFURIC ACID STORAGE TANK.  THE PLANT'S 8,797 GALLON ACID TANK IS LOCATED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE PROPERTY, ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE COOLING TOWERS (SEE ATTACHMENT 1).  PRIOR TO STARTING THE OFFLOADING PROCESS, THE TANK LEVEL INDICATOR READ 42.6% AVAILABLE CAPACITY WHICH CALCULATED TO 3,748 GALLONS OF AVAILABLE CAPACITY IN THE ACID TANK.  THE QUANTITY OF SULFURIC ACID ORDERED AND IN THE TANKER WAS 3,108 GALLONS.  AT APPROXIMATELY 9:15 AM, NEAR THE END OF THE UNLOADING PROCESS, THE TANK LEVEL INDICATOR SHOWED 7% AVAILABLE CAPACITY (~600 GALLONS) REMAINING IN THE TANK.  THE TRUCK WAS VERY CLOSE TO BEING EMPTY WHEN THE SULFURIC ACID BEGAN COMING OUT OF THE VENT PIPE.  THE LAB TECH OVERSEEING THE PROCESS SAW THE PRODUCT COMING OUT OF THE TANK'S VENT AND IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE DRIVER TO SHUT DOWN THE UNLOADING PROCESS.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY SHUTDOWN THE UNLOADING PROCESS.  ONCE THE OFFLOADING PROCESS WAS SHUTDOWN, THE SPILLAGE STOPPED WITHIN SECONDS.  THE VENT ON THE ACID TANK IS DIRECTED ONTO THE GROUND, WHICH PREVENTED SPRAY FORM OCCURRING.  AN ESTIMATED 200-300 GALLONS OF SULFURIC ACID WERE SPILLED TO THE GROUND.    THE TANK LEVEL INDICATOR WAS INSTALLED IN THE SPRING OF 2014 AND WAS LAST CALIBRATED AT THAT TIME, UPON INVESTIGATION; THE TANK LEVEL INDICATOR IS BELIEVED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE SPILLAGE:    * THE QUANTITY ORDERED WAS VERIFIED AGAINST THE QUANTITY RECEIVED.  * THE INITIAL READING OF THE TANK VOLUME SHOWED ROOM IN THE TANK TO HOLD WHAT WAS IN THE TANKER.  * THE LEVEL INDICATOR READ 7% VOLUME REMAINING IN THE TANK WHEN IT WAS FULL.    ATTACHMENT 2 - SHOW THE BILL OF LADING FOR THE DELIVERY","DESCRIPTION OF CLEANUP AND PREVENTIVE ACTION    (ATTACHMENT 3) CONTAINS A COPY OF THE SAFETY DATA SHEET FOR SULFURIC ACID    CLEANUP OF THE AFFECTED AREA WAS COMPLETED WITHIN TWELVE HOURS OF THE SPILL, AND THE WASTE MATERIAL WAS REMOVED FORM THE SITE ON APRIL 8, 2015 (SEE BILL OF LADING, ATTACHMENT 4) FOR DISPOSAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.    PREVENTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN AND PLANNED BY HAVANA POWER PLANT ARE:  * A PLASTIC CATCH BASIN (CONTAINMENT) HAS BEEN ADDED UNDERNEATH THE VENT TO CATCH ANY OVERFLOW FORM THE TANK IN THE FUTURE.  * IN FUTURE UNLOADING PROCESSES, THE TANK FILLING WILL END WHEN THE TANK LEVEL INDICATION SHOWS 15 PERCENT AVAILABLE CAPACITY (~1,300 GALLONS) REMAINING IN THE TANK.  *A NEW LEVEL INDICATOR EQUIPPED WITH VISUAL AND AUDIBLE ALARMS HAS BEEN PURCHASED AND WILL BE INSTALLED.  * A PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE WORK ORDER HAS BEEN ADDED TO HAVANA'S SYSTEM TO CALIBRATE ANNUALLY THE TANK LEVEL INDICATOR.  * THE POSSIBLE ADDITION OF A SIGHT GLASS WILL BE EVALUATED AGAINST THE POTENTIAL FOR SPILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIGHT GLASS (THE SIGHT GLASS ITSELF CAN POSE A SPILL RISK).",Yes,,Cargo tanks,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,1624,,US,

The truck operator mistakenly opened the back hatch of the cargo tank on vactor truck # 61076, causing approximately 40 gallons of lead-contaminated sediment/water to spill onto the surface of Chatterton Avenue, in Bronx County, New York.  Approximately 25 gallons of the spilled liquid entered the sewer in front of 2134 Chatterton Ave and approximately 15 gallons entered the sewer in front of 2139 Chatterton Ave. The operator immediately realized his error, closed the back hatch and used the vactor's vaccum pump to clean up the spilled liquid off the roadway and pump it back into the truck's cargo tank. The affected area of the street was washed with a detergent and absorbent was applied.  Any remaining liquid on the street's surface was removed and pumped back into the truck's cargo tank using its vacuum tube. NYC Department of Environmental Protection (NYC DEP) was immediately notified about the 40-gallon release to the NYC sewer system. NYC DEP did not take any response action.   The vactor truck was being used to clean an underground electrical structure at this location when a large rock was removed from the structure and became obstructed in the truck's vacuum tube, inhibiting its suction. The mechanic intended to raise the truck's cargo tank in order to troubleshoot and clear the blockage. The levers to raise the cargo tank and open the cargo door are located next to each other in a side control panel. Even though each lever is color coded and clearly labeled indicating the equipment it controls, the mechanic mistakenly pushed the red colored lever that opens the cargo door, instead of pushing the black colored lever that raises the cargo tank body.","The cause of this incident was operator error. The mechanic operated the wrong lever. We have issued a communication bulletin describing this event to be discussed with our operators in order to prevent recurrence.   As part of the incident investigation, we verified that administrative and engineering controls are in place in this truck.  We reviewed the control panel housing the two levers in the truck involved in the incident and we verified that there are instructional posters in the control panel that convey operating instructions in words and in diagrams. Each lever is clearly labeled and color coded indicating the equipment controlled by each lever. The lever which controls the rear hatch has a red handle, the lever that raises and lowers the cargo tank has a black handle. In addition, the control levers have a metal pin interlock that prevents them from being pushed without first removing the pin. A stopper is also present that jams the actuator, similarly stopping the levers from being pushed until the operator moves the stopper away.  To prevent similar incidents, we will verify that all our trucks contain the proper engineering and administrative controls. We will also review our training and procedures to ensure there are clear instructions regarding the raising of the truck's cargo tank to prevent similar spills.  This incident will be communicated to our contractors and other groups performing similar operations.",No,,Cargo tanks,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CONSOLIDATE EDISON CO OF NY,US,
