AT 2:45 AM, AT THE MINNESOTA HIGHWAY 135 EXIT-LOCATED NORTH OF EVELETH, MN AND SOUTH OF VIRGINIA, MN-THE TRANSPORT DRIVER FAILED TO FOLLOW THE HIGHWAY, WHICH CURVED TO THE LEFT AND DROVE ONTO THE MEDIAN BETWEEN HWY 53 NORTH AND THE HWY 135 EXIT RAMP. HE HIT THE EXIT SIGN LOCATED ON THE MEDIAN, THEN SWERVED TO THE RIGHT, OFF OF THE MEDIAN AND ONTO THE EXIT RAMP. HE CONTINUED TO SWERVE TO THE RIGHT ON THE EXIT RAMP UNTIL HE REACHED THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE EXIT RAMP. AT THAT POINT, HE TRIED TO TURN TO THE LEFT TO SWERVE BACK ONTO THE PAVEMENT OF THE EXIT RAMP. DUE TO ITS FORWARD MOMENTUM, THE TRUCK AND ITS TANK TRAILER SLID ALONG THE PAVEMENT OF THE EXIT RAMP FOR APPROXIMATELY 80 YARDS BEFORE COMING TO REST ACROSS THE RAMP (SEE ATTACHED DIAGRAM). THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME. THE DRIVER WAS TAKEN TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM FOR TREATMENT OF A BRUISED NECK AND SHOULDERS AND THEN WAS RELEASED. THERE WERE NO OTHER VEHICLES OR PERSONS INVOLVED IN THIS ACCIDENT. THE SLIDE ALONG THE PAVEMENT RUPTURED ALL OF THE INTERNAL BAFFLES IN THE TANK TRAILER, AS WELL AS GOUGING TWO HOLES IN THE EXTERNAL WALL OF THE TRAILER. THIS CAUSED APPROXIMATELY 5800 GALLONS OF FUEL OIL TO LEAK OUT ONTO THE PAVEMENT AND THEN FLOW INTO THE DRAINAGE DITCH ALONG ONE SIDE OF THE EXIT RAMP. THE SPILLED OIL FLOWED FROM THE ONE DRAINAGE DITCH THROUGH THE CULVERT TO THE OTHER DRAINAGE DITCH AND THEN INTO THE SMALL CREEK THAT DRAINED THE DRAINAGE DITCHES. ALL THE PROPER AUTHORITIES WERE NOTIFIED IMMEDIATLY, INCLUDING THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY, AND THE US AND MINNESOTA DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION. A SPILL RESPONSE TEAM CAME TO THE SCENE IMMEDIATELY TO BEGIN CONTAINMENT AND CLEAN UP EFFORTS. THE OIL REMAINING IN THE TRUCK WAS PUMPED FROM THE TRUCK AND TRANSPORTED FROM THE SCENE FOR STORAGE. THE SPILL RESPONSE TEAM COLLECTED AS MUCH OF THE SPILLED OIL FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE AS WAS POSSIBLE. THEN THEY DUG TWO SUMP HOLES, ONE IN EACH OF THE DITCHES. TO HELP COLLECT THE REMAINING OIL SO THAT IT COULD BE PUMPED OUT AND REMOVED OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. DOWNSTREAM, IN THE CREEK THAT DRAINED THE TWO DITCHES, A CONCRETE DAM WAS BUILT TO KEEP THE SPILLED OIL FROM FLOWING ANY FURTHER BEYOND THAT POINT AND TO CREATE A SMALL POND WHERE THE OIL COULD BE SKIMMED FROM THE TOP OF THE WATER.",,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,122500,Edwards Oil Company,US,

THE TRAILER WAS LADEN WITH 46,940 POUNDS OF BLASTING AGENTS.  THIS SHIPMENT WAS BEING TRANSPORTED UNDER DOT EXEMPTION NUMBER 8554.  THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE, UNABLE TO CONTROL THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL, STRUCK A GUARD RAIL RUPTURING THE RIGHT DIESEL FUEL TANK. SPARKS FROM THE RIGHT FRONT STEERING WHEEL IGNITED THE DIESEL FUEL CAUSING THE TRACTOR TO BURN.  THE ENSUING FIRE DESTROYED THE TRACTOR.  THE TRAILER MAINTAINED ITS STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY. THE HEAT OF THE FIRE CAUSED MINOR CRYSTALLIZATION OF THE PRODUCT. THE MILWAUKEE FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED.  THE INTERSTATE WAS SHUTDOWN AND APPROXIMATELY 900 CITIZENS WERE EVACUATED WITHIN A 1/2 MILE RADIUS OF THE VEHICLE.  THE FIRE WAS ALLOWED TO BURN OUT.  ANOTHER TRACTOR-TRAILER WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND THE PRODUCT WAS PUMPED FROM THE DAMAGED TRAILER INTO THE REPLACEMENT TRAILER. THE ROAD CLOSURE AND EVACUATION LASTED APPROXIMATELY  EIGHTEEN HOURS. RESPONDING AGENCIES INCLUDED THE MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFF DEPARTMENT, MILWAUKEE FIRE DEPARTMENT, MILWAUKEE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND WISCONSIN DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES.  TRI-STATE CONTRACTED WITH SUPERIOR SPECIAL SERVICES, INC., TO PERFORM NECESSARY REMEDIATION WORK AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE.  AT 20:50 CDT, TELEPHONIC NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, REPORT NO. 443192.  INITIAL NOTIFICATION TO THE MILWAUKEE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE MILWAUKEE COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT WAS MADE BY THE DRIVER CALLING 911 ON A CELLULAR TELEPHONE.  AFTER THE PRODUCT WAS TRANSLOADED, IT WAS MOVED BACK TO ORIGIN AT CHARLESTOWN, IN.  THE CAUSE OF THE RIGHT FRONT STEERING TIRE FAILURE HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED.
