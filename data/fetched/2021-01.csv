After a short trip to the Boynton Beach Clean Harbors facility, the drums were being unloaded. It was during the unloading of the drums that a small released quantity, approximately 2 oz., of material was observed on the truck. The leaking drum was identified and the pinhole leak was identified. An employee wiped across the pinhole leak with an absorbent towel. When he wiped the area of the pinhole leak, the corroded area flaked off creating a larger release, approximately 1.75 gal. that was contained and remediated. The drum was overpacked in a salvage drum along with all of the absorbent material that was used in the remediation efforts.","A Management Team Investigation was conducted regarding this in-transit release. It was noted that the driver did inspected the drums prior to loading them onto his vehicle, however, his efforts were more focused on the closure of the drums rather than the  body of the drums. It was revealed that the drums had what is perceived a heavy layer of dust on the exterior of the drum that may have concealed the area of corrosion that ultimately resulted in the release.

The caller also advised a resin product (UN3257) was in the tanker and an unknown amount leaked onto soil. ERTS dispatched an environmental contractor who reported that approximately 1 gallon of UN3257 release from the dome lid to the soil shoulder of the roadway. The contractor was able to tighten the dome lid bolt and the release stopped. The contractor tapped a hole into the tanker and transloaded the remaining product into a replacement CTMV. Approximately 1 gallon of UN3257 was released to the asphalt roadway during transfer operations. The contractor utilized granular absorbents and hand tools to clean the impacted areas.

The yard crew of Rook Yard found this leak while switching cars in the Runner Track. I called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington, PA to come out and look at the car.  They were on site just after midnight.  They confirmed that the car was leaking from the bottom outlet valve at the valve stem packing.  They said that they were not able to get a tool on the packing bolts to try to tighten the packing to get the leak to stop so they installed a Haz Hammock under the car to catch any drips.  The valve was leaking at about 1 gallon per hour.  It was determined that this car would need to be transloaded.  On 1-4-2021, we were able to located a receiving car PROX 44106.  BAPX 222437  was transferred into PROX 44106 on 1-4-2021 by Enviroserve out of North Canton, Ohio.  On January 6, 2021, Enviroserve came back to the yard to clean the car to get it ready for transportation.  On January 12, 2021, MarkWest obtained a movement approval to send the car to Home Shop.

After performing an investigation, it was found that receiving car arrived with a heel of approximately 2400 gallons before starting the transfer.  Due to the close proximity of occupied buildings and adjacent properties, the empty tank cars were not opened to verify it was empty prior to performing the transfer due to the risk of hydrochloric acid vapors being released.  The actual release of HCL was from the vapor scrubber drum connected to the vapor valve.  HCL filled the tank shell then flowed through the vapor valve down the connected hose and overflowed the scrubber drum.  All valves were immediately closed on both cars and the overflow ceased.  Approximately 10 gallons of the HCL spilled onto the hard packed gravel around the drum.  The spill was neutralized and recovered with absorbents.  The gravel area was over-excavated as well.

They immediately notified management and got to a safe location. Management responded and confirmed that the car was leaking at some point; however, there was currently no active leak at the time found as the ground was dry as well as the side of the car. There was a white, flaky residue present. M&ET management contacted the consignee (Northstar Chemical) for assistance. Their hazmat team came and identified that the gasket was bad and needed to be replaced. Northstar Chemical Hazmat team replaced the bad gasket and installed a new one. M&ET then transported the car to their facility to be unloaded and cleaned. During their inspection of the car, they found that the top hatch/dome wasn't secured properly and they determined that the shipper didn't prepare/secure the car properly for shipment.","M&ET worked with Northstar to contact the shipper of the incident and shared our findings with them. We have requested that they provide us with a corrective action plan after their investigation of the incident is complete.  I have contacted FRA Hazmat inspector Nick Buie to share what transpired and asked for his help with this as well.

Driver shut-down procedure and proceeded to release pressure from trailer before attempting to disconnect transfer line to replace gasket. When driver opened 1/2"" ball-valve to fixed stainless steel air supply line located at front of trailer on passenger side, approximately 1 quart of product sprayed out toward driver making contact with both ungloved hands resulting in chemical exposure and spill outside of containment area.     Actions Taken: 1. Spill cleaned-up by on-site personnel.  2. Rubber Gasket and transfer hose replaced resulting in approximately 4 gallons of product being drained and disposed of.  3. Driver utilized on-site eye-wash/safety shower to rinse product from hand and did not need on-site medical treatment. 4. Driver was able to complete transfer without further incident.  5. As a precaution, driver was sent to local clinic in Chattanooga, TN. the next day (1-7-21) for evaluation. Clinic issued driver ointment  to apply to exposed areas, however, driver advised clinic that the spots on his hands were not due to incident and that he was not injured due to this incident.","Root Cause: Due to manufacture's  design and location of operating valves at rear of trailer, the fact that the rear of trailer was lowered into containment area for transfer purposes, and the fact that the transfer process was incomplete; product was forced into fixed air supply line (unknowingly to driver) causing exposure and spill. Secondary cause of exposure was due to the fact that the driver was not wearing protective chemical gloves.   Corrective Actions:  1. Driver retrained on specific operations of trailer.  2. Driver counselled on always wearing required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).  3. New procedure establish for this specific scenario requiring all drivers to pull trailer to level ground before attempting to release pressure from trailer.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"HIGHWAY TRANSPORT LOGISTICS, INC.",US,

Immediately after employee was exposed, employee utilized on-site eye-wash/safety shower and was transported to local hospital for evaluation per protocol.   Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the trailer was still pressurized from previous delivery which was unknown to Olin employee and driver at the time resulting in dome-lid bursting open. It was later reported that the Olin employee was not injured and no treatment was required.","Root Cause: 1. Previous driver failed to follow established policy and procedure related to releasing air pressure and physically checking for remaining product (Heel).  2.

After positioning his truck in the appropriate loading area, a site operator opened the cargo tanker hatch and began top-loading the spent acid. Driver exited the vehicle and quickly realized he failed to close the rear bottom valve before departure to the site. Driver closed the valve immediately and site employees reacted swiftly to the spill. Site employees indicated approximately 8 gallons of the spent material was spilled. Absorbent media was used and the resulting media was containerized for disposal.","As part of our continual improvement program, details of the incident were communicated to all drivers. Aside from the immediate notification, all drivers were given further direction on the importance of pre-trip inspections. Additionally, a training meeting is scheduled for February 20, 2021 to review the incident in more detail and discuss ways to prevent recurrence. Finally, after discussion with the customer, upon arrival in the future, our driver and the site operator will communicate before engaging in any loading activity. Our database was also updated to insure these instructions are printed automatically to the driver's work order when dispatched to the site.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,US Ecology,US,

The tank car was removed from the outbound train and isolated with containment placed beneath the BOV. The shipper, Lyondell Chemicals, was notified by Rhom and Haas-DOW (consignee). Marion Env. a Conrail emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the Morrisville Yard as well as representatives from Conrail and Dow.

The tote contained UN3264,CORROSIVE LIQUID, ACIDIC, INORGANIC, N.O.S.,(HYDROCHLORIC, NICKEL CHLORIDE),8,PGII,RQ,(D006, D007),ERG#154.  Approximately sixty-five gallons of material was released inside secondary containment in the receiving building of the Part B Permitted Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility located at Heritage Environmental Services, 8525 NE 38th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.  The fork-truck operator and facility employees immediately began spill response and control procedures.  Response time for the containment and cleanup was approximately 2 hours.  Heritage personnel acted appropriately and promptly in accordance with the Contingency Plan to contain the material.   Material Involved in Incident: Approximately sixty-five gallons of waste acid pickle solution was released, identified on line 1 of manifest 001080073WAS, UN3264,CORROSIVE LIQUID, ACIDIC, INORGANIC, N.O.S.,(HYDROCHLORIC, NICKEL CHLORIDE),8,PGII,RQ,(D006, D007),ERG#154.  Heritage Transport had possession of this material as it was manifested to Heritage Environmental Services in Indianapolis, Indiana.  Approximately 863 pounds of clay absorbent and rags were recovered and placed into three 55-gallon containers for proper disposal.","Recommendations/Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence:  Based on the incident review, the forks of the forklift were too high and punctured a hole in the bottom of the tote.

He immediately stopped the truck and retrieved his spill kit. He deployed absorbent pads and damns to minimize the spread of product, and called the safety line. He informed the Safety Manager of his observations and actions, and the Safety Manager immediately notified the local Fire Department. Pembroke Fire responded and was able to slow the leak by applying pads directly to the crack. The Safety Manger coordinated with Dispatch to have nearby trucks respond to assist.  We had one truck just minutes away, And equipped with 7 empty 55-gallon drums.  Our drivers emptied product from the leaking compartment into the drums.  Associated Grocers brought their trucks that needed to be fueled to the location where are truck was leaking, and the driver was able to fuel them from the scene.  When all trucks were fueled . Our nearby tanker had arrived, and all remaining fuel in that pocket was transferred for a second tanker that was nearby and responded to assist.    Pembroke Fire applied speedy dry the product that spilled, and we coordinated with ACV Environmental to respond to clean and dispose of the absorbent materials.","The specification cargo tank was inspected consistent with the regulations. All inspections were up to date and current, and the driver conducts regular pre and post-trip inspections checking for any damage , leaks or cracks.

The order was for 42,000 lbs which is 5,198 gallons. It was overlooked that the delivery tanker had a maximum capacity of 5,100 gallons. Normally this material, which comes in totes, would be put in a hotbox to heat prior to loading. It is then transferred directly from the totes to the delivery tanker. In this case, there was an emergency order from the customer, and it was determined that the material could be heated to the specified temperature in a much shorter time by loading it on a tanker with heating coils. The tankers were connected to each other, and the transfer of materials was started. At this point, the employee who initiated the transfer went to the control room to eat lunch. The tanker loading area cannot be seen from the control room. When he returned, he found that the delivery tanker had overflowed, and product was on the ground. He then called the production supervisor for instructions. He was instructed to contain the spill to prevent it from entering any drains and absorb as much of it as possible using Green Stuff. None of the material entered a drain but some did run off the edge of the concrete onto a graveled area contaminating the dirt to a depth of 2-3 inches. As we had rain impending later in the day, we rented a small excavator. Maintenance dug out the contaminated dirt and put it in open top drums for disposal. The Green Stuff was also scraped and shoveled off the concrete into open top drums for disposal.",Remediation/Clean up cost will be submitted on a supplemental report.

The order was for 42,000 lbs which is 5,198 gallons. It was overlooked that the delivery tanker had a maximum capacity of 5,100 gallons. Normally this material, which comes in totes, would be put in a hotbox to heat prior to loading. It is then transferred directly from the totes to the delivery tanker. In this case, there was an emergency order from the customer, and it was determined that the material could be heated to the specified temperature in a much shorter time by loading it on a tanker with heating coils. The tankers were connected to each other, and the transfer of materials was started. At this point, the employee who initiated the transfer went to the control room to eat lunch. The tanker loading area cannot be seen from the control room. When he returned, he found that the delivery tanker had overflowed, and product was on the ground. He then called the production supervisor for instructions. He was instructed to contain the spill to prevent it from entering any drains and absorb as much of it as possible using Green Stuff. None of the material entered a drain but some did run off the edge of the concrete onto a graveled area contaminating the dirt to a depth of 2-3 inches. As we had rain impending later in the day, we rented a small excavator. Maintenance dug out the contaminated dirt and put it in open top drums for disposal. The Green Stuff was also scraped and shoveled off the concrete into open top drums for disposal.",Remediation/Clean up cost will be submitted on a supplemental report.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,1659,"5200 SPEAKER ROAD,",US,

The deployed vermiculite was then worked in with hand tools to neutralize the impacted areas of UN3098 Waste Oxidizing Liquid. The impacted trailer was expunged with absorbent cloth to remove any subsequent stains. A compound of liquid soda ash was then sprayed to the impacted areas to neutralize any remaining UN3098 Waste Oxidizing Liquid scent.

The rear wheels of the truck broke traction and the truck began a slow spin until it struck the right guide rail causing it to overturn. The vehicle continued to slide, on its passenger side, across the highway, striking the curb on the opposite side of the road causing the truck to flip to the other side. The force of the flip separated the trucks delivery hose and reel from the truck. This caused a short lived uncontrolled release of product. Emergency controls activated to close the open piping except for minor leak than was closed by the fire dept. and an arriving Heller's employee.","Black ice conditions were being reported by both television and radio stations. Drivers heading out were advised to be cautious of the conditions and stay alert. Rural areas such as Carroll Township in Perry County are manned by a small number of employees who man the cider and plow trucks and are unable to meet the demands when icy conditions present themselves. Fuel delivery companies have little choice when working to meet the needs of customers regardless of weather and road conditions and sometimes roll the dice and hope for the best. As Safety Director, I believe that the driver involved was doing everything possible to maintain control during the difficult conditions that were encountered. He was extremely fortunate that he wasn't injured more severely.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,150000,HELLER'S GAS INC,US,
