EE stated he was driving north on I5 through Castaic CA when he heard what he thought was an air leak. EE stated that he checked his gauges on his dash and they all appeared to be fine. EE stated that he pulled his truck over to the side of the Highway and stepped out of his vehicle to check where the air was coming from. EE stated that he walked up between the truck and the trailer to check the airlines when he got exposed to ammonia anhydrous. EE evacuated the exposed area and immediately called 911 because he had trouble breathing. EE then contacted Mashburn Transportation Services, Inc. Emergency personnel arrived to the location and shut down the traffic on the highway. An Ambulance escorted the EE to Henry Mayo Memorial Hospital in Valencia, Ca. to be checked for chemical exposure. EE was treated and released from the hospital with in a couple of hours. Once the HAZMAT crew showed up to the scene they suited up and went into the exposed area. The HAZMAT crew found that a pipe fitting was leaking the ammonia anhydrous. Once it stopped leaking the HAZMAT crew deemed it was safe for personnel to re-enter the area based upon gas readings. Lanes 1,2, & 3 were then re-opened. Nunes Cooling (owners of equipment) sent a mechanic to fix the cracked pipe fitting. After removing the pipe fitting and replacing it with a plug the emergency personnel/ HAZMAT team was able to release the vehicle from the highway and drive it to the next exit of the highway in order to replace another fitting similar so it doesn't crack while in transit. Once the repairs were complete the vehicle was then released to Mashburn Transportation Services, Inc.","Change fitting design, so that the weight of the piping is not resting on a single pipe.

SCHNITZIUS,SAFETY COORDINATOR,221 East Pine Street,Red Bud,IL,62278,Carrier,"On the morning of Tuesday, October 7th, Fuel truck 3006 was loaded with the following: Tank #1-800 gal of Ultra-low sulfur diesel, clear, Tank #2-650 gal of gasoline with less than 10% ethanol, Tank #3- 550 gal of ultra-low sulfur diesel dyed, Tank #4-550 gal of ultra-low sulfur diesel, clear, Tank #5-450 gal of ultra-low sulfur diesel clear. After deliveries 250 gal of dyed diesel and 275 of clear diesel had been dispensed. The driver's last delivery prior to the accident was to a farmer in a combine in a field on Rocky Ford Road.  Rocky Ford Road is a narrow tar and chat road and at or about 1000 hours the driver proceeded at 30 to 35 mph until he approached a 90 degree turn. The driver slowed to negotiate the turn and proceeded east toward Aviston Road. At that point Rocky Ford Road has a descending west to east slope and a culvert which crosses under the road. In addition, a pick-up truck was approaching from the east. The driver then slowed further and attempted to move to the south shoulder to allow the pick-up to pass. Just after the culvert the right rear tires left the roadway and the driver tried to slow the vehicle and make corrections.  By this time the pick-up had passed by while truck 3006 slowed either to under 5 mph or a complete stop. The driver is not certain which is correct. Regardless, the driver felt the truck lurch forward and then backward before beginning a slow roll-over onto the passenger side on the south shoulder of Rocky Ford Road. The vehicle traveled nearly 240 feet on the shoulder before the accident.  The driver was wearing his seatbelt and was uninjured except for sore ribs and a bruise on his right knee. After the accident the driver contacted the Breese facility manager, Mr. Tim Richter, who then contacted the local authorities and the Gateway FS Fuel Department Manager. One unit each from the Trenton Police Department and the Clinton County Sheriff's Department arrived to investigate. Mr. Richter arrived about 30 to 45 minutes after the accident as did the Fuel Dept. Manager. The Company Safety Coordinator was contacted by the Fuel Dept Manager at about 1045 hours. Petroff Brothers Wrecking was contacted and a unit dispatched to the scene.","In the future all Gateway FS drivers shall be instructed to determine a safe point at which their vehicles can either stop or safely move aside onto a solid shoulder, driveway, etc. when on roads where traffic in either direction may be impeded by Gateway FS equipment.

Upon arrival, ER personnel discovered that the material was releasing from a 330 gallon tote that was located in the back of the trailer. The released material impacted the trailer surface as well as two (2) 55-gallon drums and wood pallets that were in the back of the trailer. The released material was being containerized into a 55-gallon drum to prevent the material from impacting the soil surface. ER personnel donned level B personnel protective equipment and rotated a 2 man in, 2 man out rotation to remediate the release. All cargo was removed from the trailer in order to conduct remedial actions. The remaining ammonium hydroxide that was in the 330 gallon tote was transferred into a secondary tote. All impacted cargo was removed for transport and disposal by ER personnel.  Two (2) 55-gallon drums and one (1) cubic yard of waste material was generated. Crew members then deployed speedy dry to absorb any free standing material and then allowed the trailer to air out so that any remaining ammonium hydroxide inside the trailer could evaporate.     Once the trailer was cleared to leave the site by the Massachusetts DOT and EPA, all non-impacted cargo, including the remaining ammonium hydroxide, was then loaded back into the trailer for transport and delivery.

As the drum fell, it struck a load secure bar and which punctured a small hole in the side of the drum. The small puncture hole allowed the product to leak and it was estimated that 15 gallons were lost. Evirotech, a private environmental response company, responded and repacked the drum.

Clean Harbors’ personnel donned the proper PPE and placed the leaking drums into properly rated salvage drums. The waste continued on to the designated disposal facility with no further issues.

During this maneuver, a second forklift driver who had been unloading in a trailer at the dock exited the trailer and started to back down the ramp.  This driver, when at the base of the ramp, saw the approaching first forklift, sounded his horn and stopped.  The first driver (still double-stacked)heard the horn at some point and hit the brakes.  He had not completed setting the pallet down when he made contact with the second forklift.  The pallet broke and the drum fell the short distance to the ground resulting in the spill.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected GATX 56455 and reported finding 5 of 6 manway securement eyebolts less than tool tight and one eyebolt not applied/hanging. The responder properly secured all six eyebolts to a tool tight condition. Afterwards, contract responders tasked to clean GATX 56455 applied 'micro-blaze' onto the commodity spillage, water rinsed and wiped down GATX 56455. A small amount of commodity drippage from GATX 56455's side shell onto a cross-tie and surrounding ballast was also remediated. Cleaning was completed by 1630 hrs. CDT, 10/14/2014.    Per conversation with a shipper representative, prior to the GATX 56455's arrival on the BNSF at Houston, it was held on the PTRA (Anderson Railyard) in Houston for commodity sampling/testing.

A hazardous material specialist for KCS, Steve McNeilly, had called Chemtrec asking for help.  The venting railcar, IAPX 1029, was carrying Argon with a destination of Rockford IL; the shipper was Air Liquide in Nederland, TX.      Air Liquide Fleet Safety Specialist, Victor Crystal, called Mike Konnovitch in Kansas City Southern Railroad, Shreveport and discussed the incident with him.   The following information was shared:  1.  The railroad tank car was operating within design pressure.  2.  It is normal for the road safety to vent occasionally to control pressure fluctuations.  Victor thought the difference in the temperature between Bayport and Shreveport may have caused a pressure increase quicker than the road safety could handle.  The Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) may have briefly opened to release excess pressure.  3.  Mr. Konnovitch told Victor the PSV had stopped venting without intervention and the road safety was only slowly venting as designed.  Kansas City Southern (KCS) did not require any spill clean-up activities and allowed the car to proceed to its destination.  KCS did break the shipping seals and replaced them.","Railroad tank car IAPX 1029 is currently under evaluation.

FSTI driver is driving northbound on USHWY 183 approaching the town of Lockhart when a flat bed trailer pulls out in front of him.  The driver brakes hard to avoid the collision. As the driver try's to regains speed. Traffic behind him starts to backup and cars begin to pass him on his left hand side.  As he is scanning his mirrors the driver notices that his back right trailer axle is too close to the edge.  By the time the driver is able to react the trailer walks off the side of the road in the ditch.  The truck and trailer quickly roll into the ditch because of the slope. The driver tries to steer back onto the road but the weight  and forces involved with the sloshing liquid roll both the truck and trailer over .  The equipment takes 2 rolls and stops on its side with the drivers door facing the ground.    Lockhart Fire Dept and EMS respond to the accident and the diver is transported to Seton Edgar B. Davis Hospital in Luiling, TX.  The driver is found with no major injuries and is released from the hospital in a few hours.    Emergency Responders notify FSTI of the incident.  FSTI Ownership and Management briefed of situation and FSTI sets in motion emergency response with Emergency Response Contractor to assess the situation.  It was noted upon arrival that neither truck or trailer were going to be safely moved.  Another empty FSTI trailer was brought into the incident area and a 3rd party emergency response crew performs the transfer and ensures that everything is performed safely and correctly.     Details of the HM release-  The washout caps on the top of the tanker trailer were leaking residual caustic out the top of the trailer wash out caps at a few drips a minute. Emergency personal tighten caps and drips stop. Also during the rollover a small amount of diesel had leaked out of the diesel tank via the cap. After accident this leaked had stopped by itself after the truck settles. There was less than a pint of each for each of these materials that had spilled.    As a precaution and due to the uncertainty of the hazmat material Emergency crews onsite shut the down road and evacuated businesses that were close until our emergency response crews could assess the situation.  Once they felt comfortable all were opened back up.","Retraining of the Driver (completed 10.31.14- details below)    Classroom Training with 3rd Party Driving School  FSTI DRIVER involved went through a 5 day classroom discussion course that was tailored to the incident  • Post-accident discussions on what went wrong in his accident  • What he could have done to correct it  • What he can do to avoid it in the future  • Reviewed the CDL driver handbook (specifically 14-2)  • Watched a video on different rollover scenarios  • Watched a video and discussed rollover prevention techniques  • Reviewed the SNITCH system (driving technique)  • Tanker specific video and discussion    Over The Road Driver Training 3rd Party  He spent approximately 3 hours each day under teacher supervision   • performed multiple driving skills in a truck  • observing other students   • pre/post inspection activity     Received a Road Test from 3rd Party  The last day of the class he did a road test with one of the teachers.  He passed this test     Refresher FSTI offload procedures   As an extra precaution we had him do a final ride along with one of our senior drivers.  We wanted to make sure that he was current with all of our checklists and equipment.  He also passed this test.    New FSTI Driver Training Requirements  An abbreviated form of this program is being blended into our new hire training process.   After initial training new hires will report to this school for a 3 day training session to ensure that they have proper rollover prevention & driver training.  This was already being done at FSTI but we wanted to take our training program to the next level to ensure that these type of accidents never happen again.     Futhermore, this training program will now also be a requirement for any drivers that are involved in a wreck with the company to ensure that we are providing the proper training and sign off to return to work.       Other Precautions rolled out to the fleet immediately after incident-    Driver rollover awareness and lessons learned call – All FSTI Drivers  BH 10/3/14(completed) Items review below    Review of the rollover incident  Importance of reporting unsafe road conditions  Duty and empowerment for each driver to stop the job when unsafe conditions exist  Rollover review and safety    Create change meet and greet.

The driver was ejected from the tractor. The trailer had a minor leak as a result of the rollover. Emergency personnel were notified immediately and arrived on scene shortly thereafter. Emergency response team placed hazmat pads on the ground under the leak to minimize the spill.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected DBUX 301422 and reported finding 4 of 6 manway securement eyebolt nuts loose with two of these only hand tight. The responder tool tightened these loose manway securement eyebolt nuts. Afterwards, DBUX 301422 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard in order to clean the commodity spillage from DBUX 301422.   In the morning of 10/21/2014, a response contractor arrived to clean the spillage from DBUX 301422 and re-inspect its manway closure securement. The contract responders opened the manway closure and reported that the manway gasket was missing. The commodity outage was observed as being sufficient. A new manway nozzle gasket was installed and the manway closure was properly re-secured. The spillage on DBUX 301422 was wiped and cleaned.

AND TRIAD WAS NOTIFIED AND ACCEPTED THE LOAD. UPON ARRIVAL THEY LOADED 3,235 GALLONS OF WASTE FERRIC CHLORIDE SOLUTION (A CLASS 8 CORROSIVE) ON TRIAD'S STAINLESS STEEL VACUUM TANK TRAILER. THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE STAINLESS STEEL TANK AND THEY SHOULD HAVE ORDERED A LINED STEEL TANK.    THIS CORROSIVE MATERIAL CAUSED THE TANK TO FAIL AND A LEAK BEGAN AND WAS DETECTED IN KENTUCKY ON INTERSTATE 75 NEAR EXIT 95. ON 10/21/2014 AT APPROXIMATELY 09:00HRS A KENTUCKY HIGHWAY PATROL UNIT STOPPED THE TRUCK BECAUSE HE WAS DRIPPING LIQUID. IT WAS AT FIRST THOUGHT BY THE DRIVER THAT THE PACKING AROUND THE LEVEL GAUGE ON THE SIDE OF THE TRAILER HAD FAILED AND CAUSED A LEAK. THE DRIVER PULLED A FRESH VACUUM ON THE TRAILER WHEN GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK AND SAW THE LEAK; WHICH APPEARED TO STOP THE LEAK FOR A TIME. AFTER LOOKING AT THE DRIVER'S MANIFEST AND PAPERWORK AND DETERMINING WHAT THE PRODUCT WAS, THE KENTUCKY HIGHWAY PATROL TOOK CHARGE OF THE SCENE. THIS WAS A VERY SMALL AND FAIRLY SLOW DRIP AND THE MADISON CO. KENTUCKY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CLOSED THE HIGHWAY. THEY IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED NRC (THIS WAS BEFORE TRIAD SAFETY DEPT. WAS NOTIFIED). NRC ASSIGNED NUMBER 1098879 TO THE INCIDENT. TRIAD WAS NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT BY THE DRIVER AT APPROXIMATLEY 09:30. SAFETY DIRECTOR JOHN WATKINS CALLED THE NRC TO REPORT THE INCIDENT AND WAS TOLD IT HAD ALREADY BEEN REPORTED AND WAS GIVEN THE NUMBER.    WITHIN MINUTES OF THE INITIAL STOP BY KENTUCKY HIGHWAY PATROL; MADISON CO. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, THE MADISON CO. FIRE DEPT. AND KENTUCKY DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION HAD RESPONDED TO THE SCENE.    IT WAS SOON DISCOVERED AT THE SCENE THAT THE TANK WAS BEING CORRODED BY THE MATERIAL AND THE A HOLE HAD DEVELOPED JUST ABOVE THE GAUGE. AT THE REQUEST OF THE KENTUCKY HIGHWAY PATROL ANOTHER TRIAD TANK WAS BROUGHT TO THE SCENE AND THE MATERIAL WAS TRANS-LOADED ON TO THE OTHER TANK. THIS OPERATION BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY 13:00HRS. EQ WAS ALSO NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED WITH A RUBBER LINED TANK AS THE OTHER TRIAD TANK WAS ALSO A STAINLESS STEEL TANK. AFTER TRANS-LOADING THE TANK TRAILER WITH THE MATERIAL WAS MOVED TO A VACANT GRAVELED AREA NEAR EXIT 95 APPROXIMATELY TWO MILES AWAY. THE EQ TANK ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 20:00HRS., AND THEN TRANS-LOADED THE PRODUCT AND PROCEEDED ON WITH THE LOAD.

AS THE FORKLIFT DRIVER WAS APPROACHING THE LOADING DOCK, THE DRUMS AT THE TOP OF THE STACK FELL FROM THE LOAD ONTO THE INDOOR LOADING DOCK FLOOR. THE LIDS ON TWO OF THE DRUMS BECAME DAMAGED CAUSING THOSE DRUMS TO RELEASE A TOTAL OF 75 GALLONS OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INTO THE BUILDING. OF THOSE 75 GALLONS, APPROXIMATELY 20 GALLONS FLOWED UNDER THE DOCK PLACE ONTO THE PAVED OUTDOOR PARKING LOT. THE RELEASE DID NOT AFFECT SOIL, SURFACE WATER OR STORM DRAINS. THE DURATION OF THE RELEASE WAS INSTANTANEOUS. THE DAMAGED DRUMS WERE IMMEDIATELY PLACED IN UPRIGHT POSITION, AND BERMS WERE PLACED AROUND THE LOADING DOCK DOORS AND DOCK PLATES TO STOP ANY ADDITIONAL MATERIAL FROM ESCAPING. THE AFFECTED PORTION OF THE BUILDING WAS EVACUATED FOR APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES UNTIL THE TYPE OF MATERIAL WAS CONFIRMED, AND IT WAS DETERMINED TO BE SAFE TO RETURN TO THE BUILDING. THE RELEASED MATERIAL WAS CONTAINED USING A COMBINATION OF VERMICULATE, CONTAINMENT PADS, AND CONTAINMENT SOCKS TO BUILD A BERM AROUND THE MATERIAL. ONCE CONTAINED, CLEANUP ACTIVITIES BEGAN. ADDITIONAL VERMICULITE WAS PLACED ON THE MATERIAL TO ABSORB EXCESS LIQUID. ALL LIQUIDS WERE ABSORBED AND ALL CLEANUP MATERIAL WAS PLACED INTO DRUMS FOR PROPER DISPOSAL. THE DAMAGED DRUMS WERE PLACED IN OVER-PACKS.  THE DRUMS INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT CONTAINED  UN3266 FREE LIQUIDS. THESE DRUMS WERE OPEN-HEAD PLASTIC DRUMS RATED AS 1H/Y130/S/12/USA/M4232, WHICH ARE NOT RATED FOR FREE LIQUIDS. THE INCORRECT PACKAGING OF THE MATERIAL CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT. IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT ONE OF THE WOODEN PALLETS THE WAS USED FOR THE LOAD WAS DAMAGED/BROKEN, CAUSING THE LOAD TO BE UNSTABLE AND ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT.    THIS MATERIAL WAS INTENDED TO SHIP ON MANIFEST NUMBER 010778758JJK, AS NOTED IN PART II, NUMBERS 12 AND 20. AS A RESULT OF THE SPILL, THE MATERIAL WAS NOT SHIPPED ON THE LOAD.

A BNSF mechanical responder placed absorbent padding under TEIX 30000 to capture any drippage off its side shell. Contract responders reported the shipper seal at the manway closure numbered 03594 was intact. Responders opened the manway and determined the commodity outage was sufficient. The gasket installed in the manway cover gasket groove most likely was not providing a good seal. A new Salco nitrile manway nozzle gasket was installed and the manway closure was properly re-secured. All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure.

FREDERICK STREET,Binghamton,NY,13904,Other-Carrier/Shipper,15 gallon non-bulk container containing Hypochlorite solutions was found leaking in delivery trailer during Roadside Inspection at rest area.    The driver turned the container upside down to stop the leak as it was determined that the leak was from the bottom of the container. A spill response company was contacted and they dispatched out a crew to clean the trailer and pavement around the trailer where product had leaked.    It appeared that the container had developed a groove in the bottom from the pallet it was resting on when it shifted in transit; this created a hole allowing the product to develop a slow leak out of the bottom.,"The packaging was new and manufactured in 2013.  It was found that two pallets of product were secured to the trailer using one load strap.  In the future, pallets of liquid containers are to be individually strapped to prevent any future movement of containers on pallets which is what caused the hole to develop.

Approximately 50 gallons and counting has reportedly been released from (1) 330-gallon tote as the result of improper blocking and bracing/load shift when the driver hit a pot hole at a customer's location.   The acid was released onto the dirt lot below and the trailer floor; no drains or waterways were impacted. The RQ for Hydrofluoric acid is 100 lbs. Due to the potential for this RQ to be exceeded, the following regulatory notifications were made:  NRC was contacted; P.O. Ennis issued RTN# 1097175 SERC was contacted; Scott issued RTN# 201410020028 LEPC was contacted via 911 by the driver, Jeff McGee; no RTN# available PA DEP Southwest was contacted; A voicemail was left with the duty officer for the region CHEMTREC was contacted; Ken Lavezzo issued RTN# 2014100200137. MSDS was requested for this material and supplied by Honeywell, the HM shipper.   Contractor arrived and unloaded the trailer with a forklift.  The remaining material in the tote was transferred from the tote into salvage drums and put back on the trailer.  The dirt lot has been neutralized and all solidified waste has been containerized in 55-gallon drums. A total of (6) 55-gallon poly drums of usable product was able to be salvaged from the tote. Additionally, (2) 55-gallon drums of non-hazardous waste had been generated. Once the trailer has been cleaned, all salvaged product and non-haz waste will be re-secured within the trailer to be shipped back to the XPB terminal. The pallet that was impacted was also neutralized.  The total quantity of acid (.5% concentration) released from the tote as a result of the load shift was determined to be ~30 gallons.

AROUND 6:45PM WHILE DRIVING ON I-85 NEAR MILE MARKER 157 THE DRIVELINE ON THE T-21 PUP TRAILER SHEERED OFF PUNCTURING THE TANK CAUSING RED DIESEL FUEL TO SPILL OUT OF THE TANK. PHIL JAMES WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT HE HAD BLOWN A TIRE AND STARTED TO PULL OVER IMMEDIATELY, DUE TO THE WEIGHT OF THE TRUCK AND THE MOMENTUM IT TOOK .75 MILES FOR THE TRUCK TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. DURING THIS TIME 3,300 GALLONS OF FUEL SPILLED ONTO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND THE SOIL ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. NO WATERWAYS WERE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE SPILL, SO NO WATERWAYS WERE AFFECTED BY THE RELEASED PRODUCT.    INVESTIGATION: JAY COUSSENS, DAN MATHEWSON, AND JACK FARMER WERE ON LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 7:30PM. THEY TOOK PICTURES OF THE SPILL AND SPOKE WITH PHIL JAMES. DAN MATHEWSON CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THE MECHANICAL FAILURE ON THE TRUCK. DAN STATED THAT ""IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED BUT DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY DRIVER ERROR, IN THE FORM OF IMPROPER SHIFTING, WHICH CAUSED THE DRIVELINE THE SHEER OFF. HE DISCOVERED THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE DRIVELINE SHEERED OFF BUT THE U JOINT, DIFFERENTIAL, AND THE YOLK WERE BROKEN AS WELL. IN HIS OPINION THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN IS IMPROPER SHIFTING AT SPEED. DAN ALSO STATED THAT THE U JOINT WOULD BE PART OF A DRIVER'S PRE-TRIP INSPECTION AND IF IT WAS CRACKED PRIOR TO STARTING THE SHIFT PHIL WOULD HAVE NOTICED. DAN CONTINUED STATING THAT A DRIVER WOULD BE ABLE TO NOTICE DAMAGE TO HIS DRIVE LINE WHILE IN TRANSIT SO THE DAMAGE MOST LIKELY WAS CAUSED AFTER THE TRIP BEGAN. HOWEVER DUE TO THE NATURE OF THIS INCIDENT A SPECIFIC CAUSE OF THE MECHANICAL FAILURE CANNOT BE DETERMINED.","ACTION ITEMS/CONCLUSIONS: ALL DRIVERS WILL HAVE THE IMPORTANCE OF A THOROUGH PRE-TRIP INSPECTION COMMUNCATION TO THEM. DRIVERS WILL ALSO BE COUNSELED ON THE PROPER SHIFTING TECHNIQUES IN ORDER TO PREVENT MECHANICAL FAILURES OF THIS NATURE IN THE FUTURE.    AFTER THE INCIDENT A REVIEW OF PHIL JAMES RECORD WAS TRIGGERED WITH THE COMPANY. DUE TO A VARIETY OF PAST INCIDENTS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT PHIL JAMES DOES NOT MEET THE QUALITY OF DRIVER THAT ROLFSON OIL SEEKS TO EMPLOY. HIS EMPLOYMENT WAS TERMINATED WITH ROLFSON OIL ON 10/22/2014.",Yes,,Cargo tanks,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,20897,ROLFSON OIL,US,
