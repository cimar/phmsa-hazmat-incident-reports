SINCE THEY WERE PLASTIC DRUMS, PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO THEM VIA OTHER DRUMS AND A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT CAME OUT OF THE BUNG AT THIS TIME.

THE DRIVER THEN MADE THE DECISION TO EXIT I-5 AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITY, WHICH WAS HIGHWAY 126. THIS EXIT APPEARED TO BE A LOW VOLUME TRAFFIC AREA AT 5:30 IN THE MORNING, HOWEVER, IT IS THE MAIN ROAD CONNECTING SPRINGFIELD, OR WITH EUGENE, OR. BECAUSE OF THE DRIVERS TRAINING IN THE HANDLING OF LIQUID HYDROGEN, HE KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM, AND HE NEEDED TO POSITION HI TRACTOR/TRAILER UNIT WHERE IT WOULD CAUSE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF DANGER TO THE MOTORING PUBLIC. THE HYDROGEN TRAILER HAD EXPERIENCED AN UNEXPLAINED LOSS OF VACUUM BETWEEN THE INNER VESSEL AND OUTER VESSEL. WHEN THIS OCCURS, THE LIQUID PRODUCT BEGINS TO VAPORIZE AND THE VAPOR PRESSURE OF THE PRODUCT RISES TO A POINT WHERE THE SAFETY DEVICES WILL RELIEVE ALL EXCESS PRESSURE TO THE ATMOSPHERE. WITH THE COMPLETE LOSS OF VACUUM, THE ENTIRE LOAD OF LIQUID PRODUCT HAD TO BE VENTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. WITH THE HELP OF LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS, THE SURROUNDING AREAS WERE ASKED TO VOLUNTARILY EVACUATE UNTIL THE SITUATION WAS UNDER CONTROL. ONCE THE PRESSURE WAS AT A CONTROLLABLE LEVEL, THE UNIT WAS MOVED FROM THE ROADWAY AND TAKEN TO A SAFER LOCATION FOR FURTHER EVALUATION. THE TRAILER WAS EVENTUALLY TRANSPORTED TO THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER FOR A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, NO PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND NO SPILL.

THIEVES STEALING AMMONIA WERE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERING AMMONIA FROM A 1450 GALLON NURSE TANK INTO A SMALL PROPANE BOTTLE. A GARDEN HOSE WAS BEING USED TO TRANSFER THE PRODUCT. FOR SOME REASON THE THIEVES LEFT THE SCENE AND LEFT THE VALVES OPEN ON THE TANKS CAUSING ABOUT 310 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA TO BE RELEASED FROM THE TANKS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. SOMEONE REPORTED THE THEFT AND RELEASE IN PROGRESS TO AUTHORITIES. THE HONEY CREEK FIRE DEPARTMENT SET UP A WATER FOG AT THE SCENE, KNOCKED DOWN THE AMMONIA CLOUD, AND WENT IN AND CLOSED THE TANK VALVES. THE VALVE ON THE PROPANE TANK WOULD NOT CLOSE COMPLETELY. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT MAINTAINED THE WATER FOG ON THE TANK AND ALLOWED THE AMMONIA IN THE PROPANE TANK TO DISSIPATE TO THE ATMOSPHERE. ABOUT 2600 GALLONS OF WATER WERE USED TO CONTROL THE RELEASE. DURING THE RELEASE, HARLAN DRIVE AND US HIGHWAY 41 WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. AS A PRECAUTION, RESIDENTS OF ONE DWELLING JUST TO THE SOUTH WEST OF THE ROYSTER-CLARK LOCATION EVACUATED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. THERE WERE NO INJURIES REPORTED.IDEM OFFICIALS WERE AT THE SCENE ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 26 TO EVALUATE THE SITE. AT THAT TIME IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE WATER USED TO CONTROL THE AMMONIA CLOUD HAD POOLED IN AREAS OF THE PROPERTY. THE WATER WAS TESTED AND DETERMINED TO CONTAIN IN EXCESS OF 8 PPM AMMONIA NITROGEN. CLEAN UP OPERATIONS WERE STARTED TO RECOVER THE WATER AND TO GET THE AMMONIA NITROGEN LEVELS DOWN TO 4 PPM OR LESS. A BACKHOE WAS BROUGHT IN AND USED TO DIG 5 COLLECTION PITS AND TO BUILD A DAM IN A DRAINAGE DITCH. FIFTEEN ROYSTER-CLARK ASSOCIATED RESPONDED TO THE SCENE TO AID IN THE CLEANUP OPERATIONS. FOUR TANKER TRUCKS, TWO NURSE TANKS, AND THREE PUMPS WERE USED IN THE CLEANUP. TWO THOUSAND GALLONS OF CLEAN WATER WERE USED BY ROYSTER-CLARK ASSOCIATES TO FLUSH THE AREA. THE HONEY CREEK FIRE DEPARTMENT SENT A PUMPER AND TWO MEN TO AID THE THE WASHDOWN. THE FLUSHING AND RECOVERY OPERATION CONTINUED INTO FRIDAY NIGHT UNTIL HEAVY RAINS FELL. ABOUT 2.1 INCHES OF RAN FELL ON THE AREA. ON SATURDAY MORNING SEPT. 27, THE CLEANUP OPERATION RESUMED. THE WATER IN THE COLLECTION PITS AND DITCH CHECKED FROM 2 PPM TO 4 PPM. THE WATER WAS PUMPED FROM THE PITS AND DITCH. THE PITS AND THE DITCH WERE LEFT OPEN AND MONITORED. ON WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 1ST THE WATER IN THE PITS AND THE DITCH CHECKED 2 TO 3.5 PPM AMMONIA NITROGEN. THE WATER WAS PUMPED OUT AND THE PITS WERE CLOSED. IN ALL ABOUT 11,400 GALLONS OF WATER WERE RECOVERED FROM THE DITCH AND PITS.
