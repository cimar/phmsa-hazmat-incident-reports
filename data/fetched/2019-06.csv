The bottom panel of the back door was broken open and the drum was partially out of the trailer.  The drum developed a hole which caused 50% caustic to drip out of the drum and out of the trailer. The driver called his dispatch, and a clean up crew was sent from the Morrisville branch to assess the situation and clean up the spill.  In the mean time, the driver used paper towels to contain the spill and prevent the 50% caustic from entering a near by storm drain.  Once the drum leak was stopped, we were able to gain access to the trailer and determined that the load strap that was securing the drums to the side of the trailer had been pulled out of the rib in the wall of the trailer which caused the strap to loosen and allow the drum to fall off the pallet and damage the trailer door. Local police (Officer S. Clayton) and County Haz-Mat (Chief C. Prott) were notified.  By the time they arrived that drum leak was contained and the spill was mostly cleaned up.  Approximately 10 - 15 gallons of 50% caustic was lost.  County Haz-Mat helped transfer the damaged drum to a over-pack container and verified that none of the 50% caustic had entered the storm drain.  At that point, County Haz-Mat considered the scene clear and left.  Local police stayed to make sure the transfer of the remainder of the load in the damaged trailer to a different trailer was done safely.  Once that was done, local police and fire considered the scene clear and everyone left.  Traffic was never stopped on the roadway. No one was hurt in the incident, and no tickets or citations were issued.",,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar Solutions,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, Chevron Products Corp, was notified via CHEMTREC report 2019-0612-00177.  United States Environmental Services (USES), a CSX emergency response contractor, as well as personnel from Chevron responded to assess the car.  Response personnel performed both visual inspection of the car and air monitoring; no indication of a release was evident.  Additionally, the crew checked pressure and outage- 135 psig and 21” respectively.  At this time, it was also relayed that yard personnel had witnessed the suspected venting while coupling the suspect car during switching operations.  It was determined that the probable cause of the release was due to overhanding of the car causing hydraulic surge of the product which temporarily active the pressure relief device.  The car was released for transportation. Subsequently, on June 13, 2019, personnel at the CSX New Orleans Yard also reported CPDX 110088 to be venting from the top.  Specialized Professional Services, Inc. (SPSI), a CSX emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the yard and found the car to be venting from the pressure relief valve.  At this time it was suspected that the car had a faulty pressure relief valve.  SPSI contained the release with application of an emergency capping kit, transferred the lading to an empty tank car, and relieved all residual pressure on the empty car by vapor flaring.   SPSI’s certified mobile repair unit was then contracted by the car owner (Chevron) to perform replacement of the valve.  Upon removal of the Rego 8890 pressure relief valve, it was evident that the interior spring was broken.

The CT-500 contains 49 DOT-SP-14576 specification vessels, each containing ~10kg.  These vessels are manifolded to effectively make a tube trailer. 2)  One of the two drivers, “driver 2”, reported leak in vicinity of the main isolation valve of module “A” 3) “Driver 1” told “Driver 2” to “shutdown A” so he could depressure the line to effect a repair.   4) “Driver 2” shut the manual isolation valve for Module A as well as operated control panel to shutdown the pump which was filling the trailer. The fill process stopped & all air operated valves on stanchion and trailer closed. 5) “Driver 1” then depressurized the line and disassembled several fittings to repair the leak. “Driver 1” believed the rear module was still being filled. 6) During the repair, “Driver 1” observed an issue with an O-ring and realized he could not fix. 6) During the repair, “Driver 1” observed an issue with an O-ring and realized he could not fix. 7) “Driver 1” instructed “Driver 2” to “shutdown the process” thinking that fill process was continuing. 8) Since the process was already stopped, the button available to press by “Driver 2” was the button to start the next filling activity.  9) This button prepares the trailer to be filled by opening the trailer automatic valves. 10) This button was pressed by “Driver 2”, opened the trailer valves, and pressurized the manifold with the compromised piping. 11) This led to a large release of hydrogen at the rear of the front module. 12) The hydrogen release ignited with a short delay, leading to a deflagration, overpressure, and subsequent fire. 13) The fire melted the fusible link air lines and closed the valves within a few seconds. The emergency stop was also pressed by “Driver 1” 14) Overpressure from the deflagration caused distortion and movement of vessels and piping. 15) These forces resulted in damage, leakage and continued fire, leading to subsequent PRD releases.  No vessels failed as a result of this incident. 16) The fire involved two adjacent trailers and four tractors, leading to tire and diesel involvement as well. Approximately 250 kg was released. No hydrogen was released from adjacent trailers. 17) The drivers left the area and the Santa Clara Fire Department responded to extinguish the fire.","Improve driver fill procedure, to include disconnection of tractors during loading Reinforce proper protocols for performance of maintenance activity Improved training of drivers Meet with DOT and NTSB in August to discuss equipment regulations and possible improvements as a result of incident learnings.

An Illinois State Trooper in the vicinity noticed the stopped truck and invoked the local fire department/emergency response.  We understand that IDOT was also notified and coordinated lane closure during cleanup.  Approximately 120 bags of oil dry was utilized to cleanup an approximate 1.25 mile stretch of the interstate road surface (ER contractor Johnson Trucking, Sterling).  Additionally, the same ER contractor proceeded, at the direction of the IEPA ER, to excavate surface soils in proximity to where the truck had stopped due to dead and stressed vegetation observed.

The outcome of final remediation efforts will be coordinated with the IEPA ER personnel (Chuck Curtis).

Container was opened and it was noticed the cornerlashing had slipped up on the bags and the bags had shifted forward about 6 inches. 6/13/19 Innovative Repair facility Fife WA: Steve Hansen(TAM International), Juke Johns(Southern Ionics), and Damian Crespo(Cordstrap) went to Innovative Repair to reposition the bags and retighten the strapping. Incident 6/13/19@ 12:OOpm Innovative Repair facility Fife WA: When operator(Greg) was preparing to load pallet 5 into container, I noticed some sand on ground. Upon looking at bag, I noticed additional sand on pallet. I informed Greg we had a Ieaking bag and once it is placed into the ISO container, we need to stop. 2 piles were equivalent to 6 fl oz cup(1.3 Kg) between the 2 piles and a very small amount was trailed about 6 to 8 feet. Retrieved a shovel, bucket, and metal brush and cleaned up the visible sand. Due to the proximity of the container and the spilled sand, readings of the spill could not be taken until loading completed and container moved. A background survey was performed with 2 detectors- Background between 0.18 pSv/h/ 27 CPM and pSv/h/ 46 CPM. Survey after removal of material: 0.21 pSv/h/ 43 CPM to 0.30 pSv/h/ 47 CPM Removed material was placed in ISO container in a 5-gallon pail with lid. Seal applied to door. Leak from bag was either from contact with telehandler forks or plastic pallet tearing bag. Size of hole- 2 inches. U weighVactivity- 10g/262 kBq, Th weight/activity- 48g/367 kBq, Total 1.3Kg, 629kBq. Bag stopped Ieaking and placed tape over area. See attached TAM Report 6.13.19 and Attachment with pictures.",Damage to IP-1 bag was due to handling. Three Cordstrap CornerLash systems were used to secure the IF)-1 bags in the ISO containers and the strapping around the bags has been changed to using one system to restrain around the first 6 pallets of bags and then the remaining two system to restrain all the pallets. Looking into using 2-ton IP-1 bags with side supports(baffles) to maintain the cube shape to prevent the bag from bulging.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,819 BROADWAY STREET,US,

The release was a result of two 330-gallon poly totes being damaged due to tractor trailer accident. All release was reported to have impacted trailer floor and asphalt. Contractor was dispatched for remediation.  Contractor personnel arrived onsite and advised the tow company was unable to unload trailer due to not donning the proper PPE to handle the material per instruction by the Fire Department. Contractor personnel suited up in the required level A ppe to access one of the leaking totes located in front of the trailer that is releasing out of trailer in attempt to plug totes to prevent further release. The onsite tow company shifted the totes so Contractor personnel could gain access to inside of trailer. Contractor personnel confirmed approximately 170-gallons of UN1824, Sodium Hydroxide had released outside of trailer onto the asphalt and soil shoulder. Citric acid was applied to impacted areas to neutralize, absorbents were applied to impacted neutralized areas. Contractor personnel transferred recoverable material from damaged totes into new 330-gallon poly totes. It was reported the released material had saturated the trailer floor, unable to load the new totes into trailer. Contractor personnel applied neutralizer to trailer floor and absorbents to prepare the trailer to be moved to tow companies yard along with the new totes in order to re-open highway. Contractor provided a street sweeper, skidsteer and roll-off to remediate a 6’ x 140 yard impacted roadway. The initial response was completed and both lanes were re-opened. ALDOT requested a thin layer of absorbents be placed on the impacted areas. The impacted trailer was transported to contractors service center to finalize the cleaning.

After. loading, he arrived at the station, checked in with the manager on duty and obtained an initial veeder root tape. Mr Ward set up his cones to block off the unloading area, and attached the vapor hose to the ground and then to the truck. As he was attaching the vapor hose to the vapor recovery head, he noticed there was a small amount of product in the vapor recovery system and attempted to troubleshoot the issue, he then placed a spill pad under the vapor recovery system. After securing the vapor hose, he opened the internals and unloaded pot 1, and then as he moved on to pot 4, he noticed the trailer was unloading slowly. He walked the hose checking for any defects, and then the pot started to-unload at a faster rate. He then immediately noticed that there was a drip and spray out of the vapor hose- he immediately hit the emergency shutoff valve and contained the spill on the unloading area. Approximately 10 gallons of fuel spilled, and was cleaned up by the driver and the station staff. No fuel reached storm drains or retention ponds, and about 8 spill pads, 2 booms and 101bs of staydri were used to mitigate the spill.","The driver and trailer were brought down immediately to Baltimore. The driver met with the Driver Support Team and was retrained on the loading and unloading process.

It was reported that due to a cracked weld on a pipe on (1) 550-gallon metal tote of UN1992, Flammable liquids, n.o.s., 3(6.1), PGII (Contains Methyl Ethyl Ketone Dimethyl Disulfide), (Marine Pollutant) ""EM Blend 4 Sulfur Solvent"" approximately 7 gallons released to a 4' x 4' area of the trailer and soil. ERTS dispatched Environmental Restoration to respond. Due to heavy traffic and rain, the contractor did not arrive onsite until 0100 EST on June 16, 2019. The contractor located the tote and was instructed by the manufacturer to transfer the remaining product into 55-gallon metal drums. The remaining product was transferred into a total of (12) 55-gallon metal drums that were shipped onto the consignee. After transferring the product out of the tote into drums the contractor then confirmed that approximately 7 gallons of product released onto the trailer bed under the tote and was wiped with spill pads. pH strips were used to test the outside soil and came back neutral. Due to the rain, Environmental Restoration believes the product that released onto the soil washed away or evaporated. Based on the amount that was salvaged during the transfer Environmental Restoration confirmed a total of 7 gallons of product released. No cleanup was required for the soil. The contractor placed the spill pads used into a poly bag which was then placed inside (1) 55-gallon drum to be disposed of.",,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,11000,EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRAININGSOLUTIONS,US,

The load was brought back to our yard to be transported for Clean Harbors. While at the  yard, yard personnel noticed a leak coming from the trailer. upon inspection it was noticed there was  a leak in one of the barrels on the rear of the trailer. Clean Harbors was notified immediately along with the Minnesota Duty Officer and the Minnesota Department of Transportation. While waiting for Clean Harbors to arrive, Pioneer personnel applied absorbent pads to the area in and directly below the trailer on the escaped material. Upon Clean Harbors arrival they salvage packed the leaky drum. it was  investigated and found that the leaky drum had a nail hole punctured in it from a faulty pallet. the  leaked material was neutralized and absorbed and placed in salvage containers. the salvage drum  containing the compromised drum was filled with absorbent material, secured and checked for leaks.  absorbent material used for cleanup was placed in a separate drum for disposal.",I believe that the faulty pallet was the main problem. it nail head was perfectly hidden making the damage unnoticeable until enough product had leaked. A Better pallet would have been ideal and proper training on what to look for as far as degrading pallets that could compromise packaging and/or product stored in the packaging. I would like to see the haz waste industry move to non wooden  pallets or at least pallets that are discarded or pulled from use with hazmat or hazwaste and not used. I have seen some pretty badly damaged pallets that are continually used for shipping hazardous  materials.

ERTS dispatched Environmental Management Alternatives out of St. Louis, MO to respond for clean up. At 0048 EST, the contractor arrived on site and confirmed that a 25'  x 15' area of the asphalt and gravel had been impacted and that approximately 30 gallons of product was contained in several 1-gallon and 5-gallon pails by the driver. The contractor placed granular absorbents on the impacted asphalt and swept all spent absorbents into (1) 55-gallon poly drum. On June 19, 2019 at 0215 EST, the transload tanker arrived on site. At 0310 EST, the contractor confirmed that the transfer was completed with the truck pump and hoses. They successfully transferred 540 gallons of product into the new trailer. It was confirmed that they other two compartments would not need a transfer as their compartments were not releasing any material. Due to the impacted to the gravel, it was confirmed that the contractor would dispatch a skid steer to complete the clean up. At 1130 EST, the contractor with the skid steer arrived on site and began setting equipment up. Absorbents were placed along the soil edge as a precautionary measure however, the soil was not impacted by the release. Granular citric acid was placed onto the impacted area of gravel to absorb and neutralize. By 1330 EST, excavation activities had begun and the impacted gravel was placed into (5) 55 gallon poly drums and deemed non-hazardous due to being neutralized per the contractor. It was confirmed that the material did not seep deep into the gravel because the gravel was a hard road base material. At 1500 EST, the contractor departed site with all waste to dispose of.

APPARENTLY A CRACK WAS DETECTED AT THE BOTTOM O THE DRUM THAT WAS ALLOWING SOME NITROMETHANE TO LEAK FROM THE DRUM. THE CRACK APPEARED TO BE CAUSED BY A DEFECTIVE DRUM AND NOT FROM IMPROPER HANDLING OF THE DRUM. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY 1 GALLON OF NITROMETHANE HAD LEAKED FROM THE 55-GALLON DRUM. THE PORT OF NEW ORLEANS CALLED THEIR IN HOUSE CONTRACT HAZMAT TEAM TO ADDRESS THE LEAK. THE DRUM WAS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND PLACED INSIDE AN OVERPACK DRUM. ABSORBENT PADS WERE USED TO ABSORB THE MATERIAL AND WAS ALSO PLACED INSIDE THE OVERPACK DRUM WITH THE LEAKING DRUM. A PUDDY SEALANT WAS APPLIED TO THE CRACK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DRUM TO PREVENT ANY ADDITIONAL LEAKAGE FROM THE DRUM. THE DRUM AND ABSORBENT MATERIAL WAS PACKED IN AN OVERPACK DRUM AND SHIPPED BACK TO ANGUS CHEMICAL COMPANY FOR PROPER HANDLING. THERE WAS NO THREAT OR IMPACT TO THE ENVIRONMENT AS A RESULT OF THE RELEASE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR EXPOSURES REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THE LEAKING DRUM. ONCE THE DRUM WAS EMPTIED AT THE ANGUS CHEMICAL COMPANY FACILITY, THE DRUM WAS SHIPPED BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER FOR TESTING TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE CRACK.

The trailer's number four loading head caught a fire hydrant near the entry way and pulled  it from the ground. Once the loading head and airlines were damaged we lost approximately  5 gallons from the wet line. The police and fire department responded. The police did not file a  report and the fire department assisted our driver in cleaning up the spilled product. No soil or  storm drain contamination, the spill was confined to the asphalt area in the parking lot.   ETC shop foreman responded to assist the driver with the damaged trailer. Upon arrival the  trailer airlines were repaired and the decision was made to unload all of the product except for  compartment four, which contained 1000 gallons of Premium. When the shop foreman opened  the belly valve door product was released from the damaged compartment because the belly valve  was open. This created a second spill of approximately 20 gallons, which approximately 6 gallons  entered the storm drain and was released into the retention pond.
