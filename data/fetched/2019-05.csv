Slick arrived on scene at 0600 hours and found two loose flange bolts on the 2"" vent valve and two loose bolts on the flange of the fill hole.  Slick personnel were able to tighten the bolts sufficiently to stop the flow of product. Acid on the car and on the ground were neutralized and remediated. Arrangements were made with ECO Services to spot the car immediately so they could off load the product and inspect the car further. The car was moved under one quarter mile to the consignee for unloading and inspection. ECO unloaded the rail car and had Trinity Rail Car pressure test the car, no leaks were observed.

Arkema stated that there was  approximately 0.97% organic peroxide in each container.  The poly containers were then packaged in 5 gallon fiber boxes and taped shut for shipment.  The containers were then transported to Veolia's ten day intransit facility located in Philadelphia, PA.  Upon unloading the truck it was found that a reaction had occurred causing some of the inner containers to rupture and some to bulge.  The ruptured  containers caused the taped lids of the outer fiber containers to come off resulting in approximately 1.5 gallons of liquid to be spilled on the floor of the trailer.  All containers in the trailer were properly  segregated and loaded onto pallets which prevented the spilled material to contaminate any other  packagings.  The spill was cleaned up in house by the Veolia Reactives Manager and dock supervisor.

The release was caused due to improper loading from the previous loading terminal UDV allowing it to impact the trailer floor. No soils, drains, or water ways were impacted by the release. ERTS reviewed the SDS with the caller who stated he was not comfortable in cleaning and containing the release with not generating dust. Due to the release being in the nose of the trailer and due to the respiratory concerns with this product ERTS determined a contractor will need to be dispatched to clean this release. Contractor arrived onsite and located three (3) 10-lb damaged bags impacting a 1' x 2' area of trailer 3116034 floor. The damaged bags and recovered released material and containerized into one (1) 55-gallon poly drum and placed in the OS&D area for the terminal to manage proper disposal.

Unit is billed as containing mixed FAK with a corrosive hazardous material and as such, ramp operations were shut down and a 150ft perimeter was cleared until the leak could be assessed; NRC Environmental was contacted and responded to remediate. Inspection revealed the leak to be a liquid tote of cleaning compound containing corrosive contents, and it appears that the plastic tank imploded downward and then expanded outward laterally from some unknown means (possibly temperature related), breaking pieces off of the surrounding metal cage and damaging the bottom valve which caused the leaking condition observed. NRC is still in the process of cleaning and remediation, as well as pumping the remaining liquid from the damaged tote into a new one.","Ensure load is properly loaded, secured and packaged for transportation.",No,IBC,"Plastic,",11H1,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2525,BNSF - BNSF Railway Company,US,

There were no drains, soils or waterways reported to have been impacted by the release. Contractor arrived onsite and confirmed approximately 1/2 cup released impacting the top of the drum due to damage to cap from no blocking and bracing. They applied neutralizer to the top of the drum and transferred the material into a new 55-gallon poly drum to continue with shipment.

The unit was moved to the containment area for evaluation by hazmat response, NRC Environmental. Per Emergency Response Guide, a 150 isolation perimeter was established. NRC arrived and observed the leak was from an IBC tote of ""Quick Silver Concentrate"". Cause of the leak was the result of the cap unsecured/not applied. The cap was observed off to the side of the opening which allowed fluid to escape. Estimated volume loss of approximately 1 pint.  NRC remediated portions of the railcar where product escaped the trailer. NRC unloaded the tote and remediated the exterior of the tote and relevant portions of the trailer.

Front right steer tire of Truck 112 went off asphalt and onto soft shoulder at a left-hand curve in the road. Driver corrected truck, but front trailer (BAT4) and rear trailer (PAT203) caught soft dirt on right-hand side and pulled truck and trailers off the road resulting in vehicle rollover. Truck remained on solid ground but both trailers ended up in adjacent Maggie Creek. Trailer BAT4 breached and released sulfuric acid into Maggie Creek. Gilbert believes his speed at the time of the accident was 45MPH.   Trailer BAT4 was punctured at some point during the rollover. It is believed that the ""tongue"" or tow assembly of the ""pup"" trailer (PAT203) is what punctured the vessel. The puncture is an appx 8"" diameter hole towards the top of the tank near the rib above the front axle of the trailer.  The exact duration of the release is unknown. BJ Cecil Trucking contacted National Interstate Insurance upon being informed of the crash. National Interstate contracted Cura Emergency Services to initiate emergency response. Cura Emergency Services contracted Enviro Care, Inc. to respond to scene of incident.  Trailer BAT4 was extracted from Maggie Creek at appx 2100.",Gilbert Medrano has been required to undergo a reevaluation of driving skills and a retraining period before returning to full duty.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,171125,"B.J.

It was on a trailer over night on 5/15/19 at the Veolia 10 day  in-transit facility located in Schenectady, NY.  It is estimated that approximately 4 gallons leaked  over night and was discovered when employees reported to the office on the morning of 5/16/19.   After the leaking container was discovered, the spill was contained, cleaned up, and the 55 gallon  drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon salvage drum.  During the overpacking process, the leak  became worse and an additional 2 gallons of material leaked out during handling.  All liquids that  leaked were cleaned up with absorbent materials and placed in drums for disposal.  The leaking  container was placed in an overpack and transported to the final disposal facility.  The drum was in poor condition and did not appear to have a proper UN certification on it.  The  certification may have corroded or may not have been present when the drum was originally  manufactured and filled with hazardous materials.  It was observed that the corrosion was especially  bad on the bottom of the steel drum and was the location of the leak.  There was a discussion about the rust on the container at the time of initial shipment and the  offeror felt that the drum was safe to ship as it was without overpacking at the time of pick up. The discussion was between a Veolia employee and an employee of the offeror.","Veolia notified the offeror of the shipment about the hazardous material release.  Veolia told the  employee that the drum should have been overpacked prior to shipment.  In addition, the Veolia EH&S group notified the Veolia employee who took possession of the  shipment and his manager that the container should have never been accepted for transportation in the condition it was in.  Veolia EH&S explained that the container was in poor condition and did  not have an identifiable UN certification.  The container should have been overpacked at the offeror's  location prior to being placed in transportation.  Training with Veolia employees was performed on 6/5/19 to prevent this from happening again.   Pictures of the leaking container and the DOT requirements for packages to be in good condition and to have UN certification marking prior to shipping were also reviewed during the retraining  session.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

I WAS TAKING THAT LOAD TO THE MURPHY'S IN WAVERLY, VIA SR-70. THIS GENERAL AREA IS A TWO LANE ROAD, POORLY LIT WITH HILLS AND CURVES. AT THIS POINT, I GENTLY MOVED THE TRUCK CLOSER TO THE WHITE LINE TO AVOID IT. I FELT AN AVERAGE SIZE BUMP, THAN A HARD-PULLING SENSATION THAT SENT ME ONTO THE SOFT SHOULDER. I WOULD DESCRIBE THIS FEELING SIMILAR TO A BLOWN STEER TIRE. I LET OFF THE THROTLE AND ATTEMPTED TO STEER BACK ONTO THE ROAD, BUT THE SHOULDER WAS MUCH STEEPER THAN I THOUGHT. THE TRUCK WAS PUSHED BACK OFF THE SHOULDER AND HIT A DRIVEWAY ""HUMP"". ONCE I HIT THE DRIVEWAY MY TRUCK BOUNCED VERY HARD AND PULLED INTO THE DEEP DITCH THAT FOLLOWED THE DRIVEWAY. MY TRUCK ROLLED AND ENDED UP ON THE ROOF, MY SEAT HAD TURNED 180 DEGREES PINCHING MY LEFT LEG UNDER/BEHIND THE SEAT. THE DIESEL COMPARTMENT #1, HAD BUSTED OPEN AND FUEL WAS RUSHING INTO THE CAB, THANKFULLY IT STOPPED A FEW INCHES UNDER MY HEAD. MY PHONE FLEW AND WAS THROWN FROM THE UNIT, IN AN ATTEMPT TO CALL FOR HELP I WAS ABLE TO REACH THE STEERING WHEEL HORN IN HOPES SOMEONE COULD HEAR ME. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS A VERY RURAL ROAD WITH VERY LITTLE TRAFFIC AT THIS TIME OF THE MORNING. I STRUGGLED TO FREE MY LEG AND SOON ENDED UP PASSING OUT DUE TO FUMES AND PAIN. I WOKE BACK UP TO FIREFIGHTERS ON SCENE.

The batteries were secured to a wooden pallet and secured with plastic wrap.  The terminals of  the batteries were protected with tape to prevent short circuits.  The batteries were transferred from  one truck to another.  During the transfer process the plastic protecting the battery terminals was  abraded by the side wall of the trailer resulting in a small hole in the plastic wrap exposing one of the terminals.  The trailer walls had metal supports in the structure and when the exposed terminals came in contact with the metal it started to smolder/smoke.  A fire extinguisher was used to prevent a  bigger incident and the pallet of batteries was removed from the truck.  The batteries were repackaged to include a protective border consisting of cardboard in addition to the plastic wrap to protect the  battery terminals.,"To prevent a reoccurrence, Veolia will follow a new procedure when managing batteries that have side  terminals.  The terminals will be protected against short circuit by using tape or rubberized spray.   In addition, cardboard frames with a plastic fiber outer material will be used to further protect the  terminals and tape/rubber coating from abrasion.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The driver called for assistance and an emergency response team was dispatched. Several local authorities, including the fire department, police, highway patrol and homeland security came to the scene. The LA Department of Environmental Quality performed air monitoring surrounding the trailer to ensure a safe environment for entry. After several hours the response team was able to safely enter the trailer and identify the compromised container. There was impact to the soil adjacent to the highway at a space of approximately 12x12'. At the direction of the local authorities, the release was contained sufficiently enough to allow the unit to move off the highway to facilitate the remediation of the trailer and overpack the compromised container. Once the trailer and containers were cleaned to the approval of local authorities, the trailer was sent  to its final destination without further incident. LA State Report number 19-02296 and LA State Police Report numbers H19-0067, H19-0068 have been received from authorities as a result of this release.","An internal investigation into the root cause of this release immediately commenced.

This caused damage to the tanker and resulted in the release of 25% Sodium Hydroxide solution onto the roadway.  Petra contacted contractor, TAS Environmental Services, to clean up the area.  Once it was determined the RQ had been exceeded, the NRC and TCEQ were contacted by corporate EHSS personnel.  The clean-up operations were already underway.  Dallas HazMat was onsite and placed a containment basin under the leaking tanker.  Since it was storming, they were pumping the material back into the damaged tanker as basin filled. TAS arrived on scene and transferred the caustic from damaged tanker into another one brought by Petra.  They also collected 4 X 55-gallon drums of contaminated sorbents from the area.  TAS personnel met with regulators to determine the scope of the work needed.  As a result, the area was cleaned with water and pH samples taken randomly from different areas to confirm neutralization.  The sodium hydroxide solution pumped into the other tanker was re-processed at Petra's facility and sold.",,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,20000,"DPC INDUSTRIES, INC.",US,

He had loaded 7,257 gallons of butane in the lead trailer and had an empty pup and headed to Heber that night to complete his 10 hour reset. The next morning, he was headed from Heber, UT, going toward Basin Western - N. Salt Lake shop when he came around a curve at 62 mph with cruise control set and jake brakes on. The pup trailer (empty) started to shift and driver gently hit brakes to disengage cruise control. The pup tipped over to the right and the driver applied more brake pressure and tried to turn the wheel to get back on the road. The pup went on it's side and pulled the lead trailer and truck over. Driver lost control of the truck, it fell on it's side, slid off the road into the dirt, over the guardrail and into Deer Creek Reservoir. Police, fire and ambulance were called to respond, as well as Basin Western dispatch and safety team. The driver was taken to nearest hospital for evaluation and testing. Basin Western initiated calls with their insurance agency, Great West Casualty, to involve them in the emergency response. A towing company was called to retrieve the truck and trailers from the water. The butane that was on the lead trailer was trans-loaded onto another trailer and delivered to the original destination (Delta, Utah). Some diesel fuel from the truck had leaked into the water and LMH Environmental Inc. was called and various other hazmat crews were required to contain and clean up any spilled/leaked diesel from the reservoir and monitor for possible butane contamination and to take samples of the reservoir water. Barricades were put up and road closure was necessary while the clean up and towing efforts were taking place. The truck and trailers had been extracted early the next morning. Most of the environmental restoration work was completed by 5/30/19 and water samples were good. Booms were left in place over the weekend and the final check was done on Monday, June 3rd.","There was a slight variance to the driver's normal routine due to the fact that the pup was empty, and that may have contributed to the accident. He normally would have had a full load and possibly have had better control of the trailers when going around the curve. The driver was issued a citation for speeding which was also a determining factor. Basin Western management and safety compliance teams conducted an accident review with the driver on Tuesday, June 4th. It was determined that the driver was not paying attention to the posted speed limits, was driving too fast to negotiate the corner and should not have been using cruise control on that section of the highway. Basin Western has stepped up its safety efforts to focus on awareness of surroundings when driving, speeding policies, and adapting policy and precautionary procedures when hauling an empty pup trailer.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,90000,"BASIN WESTERN, INC.",US,
