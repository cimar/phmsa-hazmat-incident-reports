AGAIN THE LOAD WAS REFUSED AT FISHER SCIENTIFIC, BUT NOT STATED SO ON THE BILLS OF LADING.  THE SHIPMENT WAS THEN ORDED BACK TO FISHER SCIENTIFIC IN SOMERVILLE, NJ BY TRL BECAUSE OF LACK OF COOPERATION. THE TRUCK MADE A ROUTINE STOP OFF AT TRL'S PITTSTON, PA FACILITY FOR FUEL AND MAINTENANCE.  THIS WRITER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS S/O TO PERFORM A SEARCH AND DISCOVERY.  THE ODOR WAS NOT PRESENT AT THIS TIME, BUT A STAIN WAS FOUND ONE QUARTER OF THE WAY INTO THE TRAILER ON A PALLET THAT WAS PILED WITH FIVE GALLON PAILS.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT TWO OF THE 64 CANS LOADED HAD BEEN PUSHED TOGETHER BY A FORKLIFT CAUSING THEM TO BUMP AGAINST THE OTHER FREIGHT THAT WAS ALSO PILED UPON PALLETS.  THESE OTHER PALLETS CAUSED THE CANS TO DENT AND SPLIT WHEN PUSHED FORWARD DURING THE LOADING AND UNLOADING PROCESS.  SEE PICTURES. BECAUSE OF THE RAPID EVAPORATION, THE ODOR WOULD VARY AT SEVERAL INTENSITIES FROM NONE TO VERY APPARENT.  THE CANS WERE ESTIMATED TO HAVE LOST ONE QUART EACH.
