THE FIRST 40 FEET OF HOSE BELONGED TO THE CARRIER AND THE REMAINAING HOSE BELONGED TO THE CONSIGNEE.  APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF THE 1500 GALONS HAD BEEN PUMPED OFF WHEN A SPLICE IN THE CONSIGNEE'S HOSE CAME APART AND MOST OF THE REMAINING 500 GALLONS DISCHARGED ON TO THE GROUND.  ABOUT HALFWAY THROUGH THE PUMPING PROCESS THE DRIVER CLIMBED IN THE DRIVERS SEAT OF HIS TRACTOR TO CATCH UP ON HIS PAPER WORK AND FAILED TO NOTICE THE HOSE FAILURE.  WHILE THE DRIVER MAY NOT HAVE PREVENTED THE FAILURE OF THE HOSE SPLICE AND THE INEVITABLE ""HAZMAT INCIDENT"" HE CERTAINLY COULD HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF THE SPILL HAD HE HAVE BEEN MORE OBSERVANT DRUING THE PUMPING PROCESS.  I FEEL THAT HE HAD MADE A SERIOUS ERROR IN JUDGEMENT BY ASSUMING THAT BECAUSE THE FIRST HALF OF THE TRANSFER WENT OK THAT ALL WOULD REMAIN WELL.  THIS VERY PROCEDURE WAS JUST COVERED IN A SAFETY SEMINAR FOR OUR DRIVERS ON APRIL 12 OF THIS YEAR.  WHILE THE DRIVER HAS AN EXCELLENT DRIVING RECORD AND HAS ALSO BEEN A VERY GOOD EMPLOYEE FOR OUR COMPANY HE HAS BEEN REPRIMANDED SEVERLY FOR HIS POOR JUDGEMENT AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE DISCHARGE IN THE EVENT IF A SIMILAR INCIDENT IN THE FURUTE.  IN ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF THE FAILED HOSE SPLICE I AM ADVISING OUR DRIVER S THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST CHECK OUR OWN HOSES AND FITTINGS, BUT OUR CUSTOMERS ALSO.  IF THEY FIND A PROBLEM WITH A CUSTOMER'S EQUIPMENT OR PROCEURE THEN ADVISE THE CUSTOMER TO PLEASE REMEDY THE POTENTIAL HAZARD.  IF THE CUSTOMER FAILS TO DO SO THEN THE DRIVER SHOULD CONSULT WITH HIS SUPERVISOR ABOUT THE HAZARD, BUT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD HE ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE TRANSFER UNTIL HE IS SATISFIED WITH THE SAFETY OF ALL EQUIPMENT BEING USED.  A HOSE SPLICED WITH THE WRONG SPLICING MATERIAL SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNACCEPTABLE TO OUR DRIVER EVEN IF HE WAS DIRECTED TO HOOK ON TO IT BY THE CONSIGNEE'S EMPLOYEE AND EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN USED BEFORE WITHOUT INCIDENT. ALL OF OUR DRIVERS HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO KEEP THE TRANSFER PROCESS IN SIGHT AND REMAIN PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN AT ALL TIMES DURING THE TRANSFER.  EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED SHORTLY AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE SPILL AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND HAZMAT TEAM ARRIVED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS.  THE SPILL WAS CONTAINED TO THE IMMEDIATE AREA WITH SAFETY SOCKS, (THESE ARE CARRIED ON ALL OF OUR TRACTORS) AND SAND APPLIED TO THE SURFACE OF THE SPILL.  THERE WAS NO RUN OFF TO PUBLIC LAND OR WATERS.  THIS PRODUCT IS VERY THICK AND SETS UP QUICKLY WHEN EXPOSED TO AIR.  THIS HELPS TO LIMIT THE SPREAD AS COMPARED TO A LOW VISCOSITY PRODUCT.

WE PH'D THE LIQUID, FOUND THE READING TO BE NEUTRAL AND PROCEEDED TO CHECK THE BOXES FOR THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK. WE OPENED A LARGE FIBERBOARD BOX AND THE ODOR BECAME VERY STRONG.  WE EGRESSED AND DONNED CARTRIDGE MASKS, THEN CONTINUED OUR INVESTIGATION.  WE PH'D LIQUID ON THE INSIDE OF THE BOX AND ON THE CONTENTS AGAIN FOUND A NEUTRAL READING.  WE FOUND INSIDE THIS BOX SEVERAL NON AEROSOL SPRAY TYPE PLASTIC BOTTLES, A HAND PUMP TYPE SPRAYER, A COUPLE OF GALLON SIZE PLASTIC BOTTLES AND A SMALL 14 OUNCE PLASTIC BOTTLE.  ALL OF THESE FOUND A READING OF 0 FROM THE LIQUID IN THE 14 OUNCE BOTTLE.  WE CLOSED THE BOX AND PLACED IT INTO A PLASTIC BAG.

THE CONTENTS OF THESE BOXES WERE TAKEN TO THE REPACKAGING DEPT AND PLACED INTO NEW OUTER BOXES.  THEN THESE BOXES WERE SENT ON TO THEIR DESTINATION.  A MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET WAS REQUESTED FROM THE SHIPPER ON THE 14 OUNCE BOTTLE OF ""ERUSTICATOR"" DUE TO THE PH READING OF 0.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE BOX REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS DUE TO FRICTION TYPE CONTAINERS WITH NO POSITIVE MEANS OF CLOSURE AND IMPROPER ORIENTATION OF THE CONTENTS.
