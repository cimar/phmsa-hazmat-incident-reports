THE RELEASE FROM BULK PACKAGE RESULTED FROM A CHEMICAL REACTION INSIDE THE CARGO TANK FROM SOLIDIFIED MOISTURE (ICE) AND ROOFING ASPHALT.  WHEN TANKER TRAILERS ARE NOT USED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, MOISTURE CAN COLLECT INSIDE THE TANKS.  WHEN THE DRIVER FILLS A TANK THEY DO A TEST FILL, WHERE THE OPERATOR PUTS 200 GALLONS OF ROOFING ASPHALT AT 400 F INTO THE TANK TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY REACTION.  THE MATERIAL IS THEN ALLOWED TO STAND FOR 10 MINUTES TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO MOISTURE OR ICE INSIDE THE TANK.  THIS WAS DONE WITHOUT ANY REACTION.  THE OPERATOR THEN FILLED THE TANK, AND THE DRIVER LEFT THE FACILITY.  THE DRIVER WAS APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES DOWN THE ROAD, AND NOTICED STEAM ESCAPING FROM THE OVERFLOW AREA.  HE REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND GOT THE TRUCK OFF THE ROAD AND ONTO THE SHOULDER NEAR THE DITCH.  THE MOISTURE AND ASPHALT REACTED CAUSING THE MATERIAL TO EXPAND CAUSING AN OVERFLOW OF ASPHALT FROM THE TANKER.  THIS CONTINUED UNTIL ALL MOISTURE HAD ESCAPED FROM THE TANK.  APPROXIMATELY 200 GALLONS OF THE ASPHALT DRAINED INTO THE DITCH AREA.  UPON COOLING, E. R. BERWALD ROOFING CO., INC. USED SKID STEER LOADERS TO CLEAN UP THE SPILLED ASPHALT.  IN THE FUTURE THE DRIVERS WILL WAIT AN ADDITIONAL 10 MINUTES AT THE MANUFACTURER'S FACILITY WHEN THE TANK IS FULL TO ENSURE NO REACTION IS TAKING PLACE BEFORE LEAVING.  OUR ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ICE WAS INSIDE THE TANK, AND WAS ENVELOPED BY ASPHALT DURING THE TEST FILL.  THIS PREVENTED THE ICE FROM MELTING QUICKLY, THUS POSTPONING CHEMICAL REACTION.  THE ADDITIONAL WAIT TIME BEFORE THE DRIVER LEAVES WITH THE ASPHALT SHOULD PREVENT THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF ELEVATED TEMPERATURE LIQUID, N.O.S., 9, UN3257, PG III, FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

CHARLES BARRAND, OUR TRUCK DRIVER CAME INTO THE RECEIVING OFFICE AND INFORMED ME, RICH PETZ, THAT OUR HYDROCHLORIC ACID TANKER WHICH WAS HOOKED TO #1 PETERBILT TRACTOR WAS STOPPED IN FRONT OF OUR NEIGHBORS, TARCO CONSTRUCTION, AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID WAS LEAKING OUT OF THE TANKER ON TO THE STREET. WE RAN OUT TO THE TANKER AND I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO THE UNLOAD VALVE, FOUND THAT IT WAS IN THE OPEN POSITION WITH HYDROCHLORIC ACID COMING OUT OF THE UNLOADING LINE. I SCREWED THE VALVE TO THE CLOSED POSITION STOPPING HYDROCHLORIC ACID FROM LEAKING OUT. I THEN INSTRUCTED THE DRIVER, CHARLES BARRAND, TO TAKE THE TRACTOR-TRAILER OFF OF THE STREET, AND GO TO THE LOADING SCALE WHERE THERE IS CONTAINMENT AND WASH THE ENTIRE TRACTOR-TRAILER DOWN WITH WATER. I THEN INSTRUCTED JESUS BARRERA TO PUT A MAN ON EACH END OF THE SPILL TO STOP ALL TRAFFIC. WE THEN LOADED 1,000 GALLONS OF FRESH WATER ON TO #18 OUR INTERNATIONAL TANK TRUCK AND MYSELF AND JUAN TREJO DROVE TO THE POINT OF THE SPILL AND PROCEEDED TO PUT THE WATER ON TO THE SPILL IN ORDER TO KNOCK DOWN THE HYDROCHLORIC ACID FUMES WHICH I FELT AT THAT TIME WAS THE BIGGEST AREA  OF CONCERN AS THE FUMES COULD DRIFT AND BE INHALED CREATING A HAZARD. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 6:00 A.M. AT THIS TIME. WE WORKED OUR WAY FROM THE WEST TO THE EAST KEEPING THE WATER ON THE HYDROCHLORIC ACID AHEAD OF US. WE THEN REFILLED THE TANKER WITH 2,000 GALLONS OF FRESH WATER AND STARTED THE PROCEDURE ALL OVER AGAIN. ONCE I REALIZED WE WERE GAINING ON THE FUMES, I PHONED THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY, ROBERT L WILSON II, AND OUR MATERIAL/REGULATIONS MANAGER, ALAN BIESEMEIER. OUR NEIGHBOR, TARCO CONSTRUCTION CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY HAD ARRIVED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE SPILL. APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES HAD ELAPSED SINCE WE STARTED TO PUT THE WATER ON THE SPILL. WHILE PLANT PERSONNEL WAS PUTTING ON MORE AND MORE WATER TO HELP DILUTE THE HYDROCHLORIC ACID, I SPOKE WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND EXPLAINED TO THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD DONE FROM THE TIME THE SPILL HAD STARTED TO THE PRESENT TIME. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT WE HAD DONE AND THEY CONTACTED THE FIRE CHIEF, MR. GEORGE DITOLLA, TO ASK WHETHER HE FELT THEY SHOULD CALL OUT THE LOCAL EMERGENCY HAZARDOUS RESPONSE TEAM. GARY ARMADA MADE THE DECISION NOT TO CALL OUT THE TEAM WITH THE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO HIM BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL ON SCENE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THEN ASSISTED US IN APPLYING MORE WATER TO DILUTE THE SPILL. AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ASKED IF WE COULD MAKE A DETERMINATION ON HOW BIG A SPILL WE HAD. WE WEIGHTED THE TRACTOR-TRAILER AND COMPARED THAT WEIGHT(SEE ATTACHED) WITH THE ORIGINAL SCALE TICKET SHOWING WHAT PRODUCT WAS ON BOARD. WE DETERMINED THAT WE HAD LOST 140 POUNDS, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 14.6 GALLONS AT 34% STRENGTH 31.4 HYDROCHLORIC ACID. WE GAVE THAT INFORMATION AND COPIES OF THE WEIGHT TICKETS TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. AT THIS TIME WE",,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,46,,US,

PAUL HAGMANN AND I DID GO TO HIS HOUSE TO CHECK THE VAN OUT AND THERE WERE LITTLE SPECKLES OF PAINT ALL OVER HIS VAN. I TOLD HIM THAT WE WILL CALL HIM BACK AND LET HIM KNOW WHAT OUR COMPANY WAS GOING TO DO, BUT WE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT HIS VAN WAS TAKEN CARE OF PROPERLY AND WE WOULD CORRECT THE PROBLEM OUR DRIVER HAD CAUSED. I CALLED BACK BRETT ON FEBRUARY 20, 2002 AT 8:00 A.M. AND I GAVE HIM THE NAME OF THE PERSON(MIKE KRUEGER) TO SPEAK WITH AND GAVE HIM THE TELEPHONE NUMBER TO REFLECTIONS AUTO BODY AT 1804 E. LAYTON AVE., MILWAUKEE. AFTER JASON GOT BACK TO THE BOBOLINK LOCATION HE NOTIFIED LARRY DIETRICH OF THE MISHAP. LARRY INFORMED JASON TO START CLEANING THE BACK OF HIS TRAILER ALONG WITH BILL GRULKOWSKI. THE WASTE MATERIAL WAS CLEANED UP USING ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND DISPOSED OF IT AS A HAZARDOUS WASTE. AT ABOUT 3:45 P.M. I CALLED THE RELEASE INTO THE WISCONSIN SPILL REPORT NUMBER 1-800-943-0003 THE PERSON WHO ANSWERED TOOK  MY NAME AND PHONE NUMBER. HE TOLD ME HIS NAME WAS CHAD ROSS. I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT NO ONE WAS INJURED. THE WASTE MATERIAL WAS CONTAINED IN THE BACK OF THE TRAILER,  BUT I DID THINK A VERY SMALL AMOUNT HAD LEAKED OUT THE BACK OF THE TRAILER. I TOLD HIM APPROXIMATELY 10 GALLONS HAD RELEASED FROM THE DRUM. AT NO TIME DID THE WASTE COME IN CONTACT WITH ANY WATER OR SOIL. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. I ALSO NOTIFIED THE FEDERAL AGENCY AT 4:01 P.M. AND TALK TO MS. JOHNSON. I EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS ALL CONTAINED INSIDE ONE OF OUR TRAILERS, OUR TRAILERS, BUT I DID THINK A VERY SMALL AMOUNT LEAKED OUT ONTO HWY 45. SHE ASKED ME IF I KNEW OF THE MILE MARKER WHERE IT COULD HAVE LEAKED OUT, I SAID I REALLY DON'T KNOW. SHE ALSO ASKED ME WHAT SIZE THE TRAILER WAS AND I TOLD HER THE TRAILER HELD 88-55 GALLON DRUMS. THE RELEASE WAS CLEANED UP AND WE DID NOT REQUIRE ANY HELP FROM OUTSIDE OUR COMPANY.
