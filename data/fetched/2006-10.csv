Griffin Brothers is located within one half mile from the Oak Harbor terminal. The Hydrochloric Acid was contained in a plastic tote, which was protected by a metal cage.      After loading the driver proceeded directly to the Oak Harbor terminal and upon arrival noticed that the tote had began to leak. Griffin Brothers was called immediately and due to their close proximity resronded to contain and clean up the spill. The spill was restricted to the location that the truck was parked at and there was no run-off into storm or other drainage. This area is paved with asphalt.      Griffin Brothers personnel used soda ash to neutralize the entire product that had spilled. They eilso pumped the remainder of the product from the leaking tote into another tote and returned both to their bu iness. They also used soda ash to neutralize any acid within the trailer. They estimated that amount of the spill was 15 to 25 gallons and total duration of this spill was approximately one hour and 15 minutes. Total cleanup lasted about 3 hours from the start of the incident.      It appeared that something had been stacked on top of the tote at some point prior to shipment with Oak Harbor and this had caused the cracks in the top of the tote. There were three cracks and breaks in the tote apparently all caused by compression. Two cracks were in the top of the tote at the edge and were approximately 3” -4” long. One other crack was near a corner and ran down the side of the tote approximately 4”.","The driver, prior to the shipper loading these articles into the trailer, should do better inspection of totes.

The driver arrived with the shipment at the Veolia, Henderson facility at approximately 4:30 PM on Tuesday, October 17, 2006, and was put into temporary storage to be received on Wednesday, October 18, 2006.    At approximately 8:00 AM on October 18, 2006 the receiving crew at the Veolia, Henderson facility  began unloading the containers from the trailer.  It was at this time that the tote was discovered to be leaking.  The receiving crew immediately notified the facility EH&S Manager of the leak.  Within minutes of the investigation, approximately 280 gallons was shown to missing from the tote.  The material had leaked out of the trailer onto the soil beneath it.      After review of the shipping document, the RQ of 100 pounds was identified for a D001 hazardous waste characteristic.  The NRC and the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE) were then immediately notified. This was approximately 8:15 AM.      Veolia then arranged for a contractor to remediate soil.  Approximately 17 yard of soil was excavated from the spill. Soil samples have been taken and sent to a laboratory for analysis as directed by CDPHE.  The area will be cleaned to the Colorado Soil remediation standards.  All contaminated soils will be sent for proper hazardous waste disposal.     After investigating the tote, it was noted the fill valve on the bottom of the tote was not completely shut, and the gasket was missing from the valve cap.  The receiving crew shut the valve and replaced the gasket, which caused the leak to stop.",The incident will be reviewed with the Veolia driver and Array Biopharma to ensure that all future containers are closed in a manner which conform to the applicable requirements of the specification in addition to the information contained in the manufacturer's notification as directed by 173.24(f).,Yes,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,9500,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

At the time of the release the driver of the vehicle was completing a loading operation at Vanderbilt Chemical located in Bethel, CT.   The tanker truck was loaded with Waste Corrosive Liquid, Flammable n.o.s. (Heptane, Sulfuric Acid) 8, (3), UN 2920, PGII.   While closing the dome hatches and inspecting the valves, the driver notices that the internal valve was leaking through the packing seal at the flange where the pneumatic actuator is located.  The driver immediately notified the onsite contact of the leak and applied vacuum to the tanker to prevent any further discharge of the waste material.   An in house emergency response crew was dispatched to perform any necessary clean up operations and to collect any resulting spill clean up material for future disposal.      Vanderbilt Chemicals also notified CT Department of Environmental Protections of the incident.  Concurrently, CHES driver notified his dispatch of the incident and an alternative tanker was dispatched to the location to transfer the material.       The length of the release was approximately two minutes and approximately 8 oz of the material leaked out onto pavement.      Upon arrival of an alternative tanker, all of the material was transferred without any further incidents.  The damaged tanker was placed out of service until all necessary repairs can be made.",  Our initial investigation determined that the rear internal valve packing was damaged and not sealing as designed.

MARCON,TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT CORRDINATOR,4334 NW Expressway Suite 124,OKLAHOMA CITY,OK,73116,Carrier,"On October 3rd 2006 a truck tractor and a non specification cargo tank motor vehicle departed the Cudd Pressure Control, Inc. terminal.  Shortly thereafter it was involved in a roll over motor vehicle accident in Midland County Texas near the city of Odessa, Texas on the Interstate 20 service road and IH-20 shoulder.  The cargo tank was carrying Nitrogen Refrigerated Liquid used in oil field servicing.  The tank released approximately 100 gallons of the hazardous material from the damaged manway into the environment.  The physical properties of the cryogenic liquid causes a cloud vapor when released into ambient temperature.  The liquid is converted into a harmless nitrogen vapor as it is dissipated into the atmosphere.  This cloud, drifting over I-20, caused visibility limitations thus the closing of the west bound lanes of IH-20 for approximately 1 and ½ hours while the tank was emptied.   As reflected on the inspection report hereto attached the inspector stated that the release was due to damage of the manway, which occurred when the interior tank shifted upon impact with the ground.","It is the concern of Cudd Pressure Control, Inc. that the requirement for this report was produced at the direction of local authorities to accomplish a controlled release of a cloud vapor producing material which caused visibility limitation on IH-20 and required the closure of this transportation artery in excess of the regulatory limit for reporting.  As always improved training and improvements in operational procedures reduce these events.  Technology does not provide a better package at this time, except for specification tanks and the hazardous material involved in this event under certain conditions does not require a specification tank.  Those conditions were present at the time of this event.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,302900,Cudd Pressure Control Inc.,US,

As a result approximately 7 gallons of the material was released onto the trailer flooring.  At approximately 5:26 pm CDT, KLLM Transport Services retained Cura Emergency Services (CES) to manage the environmental clean up operations. Based on the information provided the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from Patriot Environmental (Patriot) to perform the corrective actions. The crew from Patriot arrived on-site and assessed the scope of the release. The crew began corrective actions by opening the trailer doors to ventilate the released material prior to entering the trailer. Once the trailer had ventilated the crew entered the trailer and inspected the drums. One of the 55-gallon drums was found to be rusted and damaged. They overpacked the damaged drum.

The responders then checked the condition of the upper 0-ring, finding the 0-ring edge slightly curled on 2/3’s of the ring’s circumference. This o-ring was flipped over and reinstalled. After the PRD was resecured, no detectable vapor or odor registered on the responder’s calibrated air monitoring device. Response was concluded by 1915 hrs. CDT, 10/03/06.

The area was immediately isolated and CSX Management implemented their emergency response plan. Chemtrec was notified (report number 10012006012) and the shipper, Exxonmobil was informed of the release. Hepaco Environmental was contacted to respond and secure the container. Once on site, Hepaco representatives found the vacuum relief device inoperable and stuck in the open (down) position. Hepaco utilized wooden wedges to force the vacuum relief device in the closed (up) position until proper repairs could be arranged. This action temporarily secured the tank car from releasing vapors. On Monday, October 2nd Exxonmobil contacted Rescar to inspect and replace the defective valve. Rescar responded to the site, inspected the tank car, and ordered the correct replacement parts. Rescar representatives returned to Cayce Yard on Tuesday, October 3rd and replaced the valve with a plug at the request of the shipper. They also performed a leak test of the container. After completion, the car was released to destination.

The driver attempted to put the fire out with a fire extinguisher but was unable to prevent the fire from spreading to the trailer. The driver contacted the local authorities who mobilized a hazmat team for response to the fire and hazmat containment.  At approximately 20:40 CST, the hazmat team recommended that the Shelby County Sheriff's office evacuate all residences within 1/2 mile of the incident and allow the product to burn.  The Texas Highway Patrol also closed Hwy. 59 in both directions.  At approximately 22:20, 3-A foam was applied to the fire which was suppressed by 22:35.  At 23:00 the local authorities were advised that evacuees could be reinstated to their homes.  At aproximately 23:30 the two northbound lanes were converted into two way traffic to open the roadway.

Fiberglass units have greater longevity, less suspect to corrosion, no liners (and hence no opportunity for sudden liner failure) and are better suited overall for hypochlorite service.  We just have to continue on that path of eventually changing out all tankers in our fleet.

This switch crew also reported a strong odor emanating from GATX 18284 and this tank car was cordoned-off in the railyard. All operations within 150 feet of GATX 18284 were ceased. GATX 18284 was inspected by consignee responders. Responders reported finding 3 manway swing bolts not applied and the other 3 manway securement bolts finger loose. Remnants of the manway gasket appeared fixed around the rim of the manway lid. The deteriorated condition of the gasket prevented a good seal. Responders installed a new gasket, applied and tool tightened all manway securement bolts. The spillage around the manway and on the tank car shell was wiped. Minimal ground impact was noticed and responders excavated a small amount of impacted soil and ballast that was placed into a 5 gallon plastic bucket for appropriate future disposal. Absorbant material was also applied to other very small ground impact areas. Response was concluded by 1115 hrs.

Responders didn’t have a suitable corrosive service disc with them and decided to replace the failed disc with a 100 psi corrosive service frangible disc so that GATX 60914 could be carefully moved to an isolated area in the railyard until a suitable 165 psi disc could be installed. Responders checked all other top fitting securement and found all to be secure. The spillage was confined to the protective valve housing area and it was neutralized and wiped. Contractor response was concluded by 0730 hrs. MDT, 10/15/06. Shipper was notified to replace the frangible disc with a 165 psi disc before GATX 60914 could be released to proceed to its destination. On 10/18/06, the initial response contractor replaced the 100 psi frangible disc with a new 165 psi frangible disc for corrosive service that was supplied by the shipper.

As the transport was negotiating a heavy curve entering Bayonne, NJ on US Rt. 440 southbound the driver reports that another truck alongside him left his lane and forced our cargo tank to move over.  Our cargo tank motor vehicle struck a curbing which began the roll-over process.  Our cargo tank motor vehicle landed and remained on the median between southbound and northbound lanes at 0410.  The driver removed himself from his cab and contacted Kuehne.  We dispatched emergency vehicles and an available cargo tank motor vehicle.  When we arrived on-site at 0430 we found the self-closing relief valve would not close and hypochlorite was spilling at a medium rate.  We contained this spill with a large bucket and evacuated the bucket using a small pump to a container effectively stopping the release shortly thereafter.  Berms were set up so as not to allow any more material to enter the storm drains.  The replacement cargo tank motor vehicle was staged alongside and the remaining contents of the damaged cargo tank were transferred.  In all approximately 1500 gallons were recovered.  The New Jersey DEP were on-site and took PH readings at a collection area serving the storm drain.  These readings were neutral due to the tidal action.  Remaining hypochlorite on the roadway was neutralized with citric acid powder.  Kuehne then transported a cargo tank motor vehicle loaded with clean fresh water and the roadway was rinsed to the storm drain.  All material spilled onto the median grassy area was removed using an excavator, loaded onto a roll-off container and will be properly disposed of.  All remediation charges are not in as of yet and the value of total damages listed under question 32 are only estimates.",Kuehne has decided that though our driving staff has an average tenure of almost ten years we will contract with experts in the field of liquid transportation to discuss with the drivers the physics involved with the handling of liquids to include sloshing and transverse free surface effects.    It would be beneficial to undertake a study where innovative and novel designs could be assessed which may result in the relocation of the cargo's center of gravity to a lower position off the roadway.  This would be especially important in the safer handling of higher density materials.    It would be beneficial to utilize rollover testing or simulations for known cargo tank combination designs to assist in the development of radius standards for new highway construction.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,93500,"Kuehne Chemical Company, Inc.",US,

An employee at the location noticed small amount of material seeping through the van trailer floor.  He immediately notified his supervisor of the spill and an in house emergency response crew was dispatched to identify the source of release and to take all necessary corrective actions.  Upon review of the paperwork, the emergency response crew donned appropriate protective equipment and entered the trailer.  An inspection of the non-bulk packages in the trailer identified that a single 55-gallon UN 1A1 container of Class 9 liquid experienced a failure at the seam of the container located near the top third of the drum.  The response crew immediately used a chemically compatible absorbent material to contain approximately 10 gallons of liquid that was release to the floor of the trailer.   The leaking drum was placed in a suitable salvage drum and all of the absorbent was collected and placed into appropriate container for disposal at an approved hazardous waste management facility.   Approximately one quart of material leaked through the floorboards of the van-trailer onto gravel and compacted dirt pad.  The contaminated area was excavated, the material placed into appropriate containers for disposal at an approved hazardous waste management facility.     The time frame from the initial notice of the spill until the drum was overpacked and the spill clean up was approximately 2 hours.  All of the released material was collected and no offsite impact occurred.",Our investigation determined that the cause of the incident was deterioration of the container on storage and insufficient inspection prior to transportation.

Train traffic was suspended and all personnel were notified to stay clear of the odor source area. BNSF responders reviewed the track lists and identified two tank cars with potential of the odor source. Inspection of one of these tank cars, CRPX 9704, revealed that the sample line was leaking due to the valve plug being improperly installed on the riser nipple. The valve was closed, but the valve assembly appeared to be cross-threaded, since it was at an angle to the nipple, rather than straight and inline. Evaluation of the corrective options determined that the immediate delivery of CRPX 9704 to the consignee, less than 20 miles away, was one of the safest options. The consignee was contacted and agreed to accept CRPX 9704 for immediate unloading. An emergency movement waiver was sought from the FRA; however the FRA advised that none was required due to the short distance to destination and the small amount of product that could be released into the atmosphere. BNSF responders concluded response by 1215 hrs. PDT, 10/02/06. Rail traffic commenced at 1320 hrs. PDT, 10/02/06. CRPX 9704 was delivered and placed at the consignee’s facility for unloading by 1030 hrs.

THE   TRUCK WAS TRAVELING SOUTH ON ROUTE 268 WHEN A COLLISION WITH A PASSENGER VEHICLE   OCCURRED. THE TRUCK TURNED ON IT SIDE AND APPROXIMATELY 2,900 GALLONS OF WEAK ALKALI LIQUOR (WAL) WAS RELEASED FROM THE TANKER VESSEL. RELEASE FROM THE VESSEL WAS DUE TO DAMAGE THAT OCCURRED TO THE DOME COVER DURING THE ROLLOVER OF THE TANKER VESSEL. THE DURATION OF THE RELEASE OF THE MATERIALS FROM THE TANKER VESSEL LASTED APPROXIMATELY 3 HOURS. THE REMAINDER OF THE MATERIAL IN THE OVERTURNED TANKER VESSEL WAS THEN TRANSFERRED TO A WAITING TANKER VESSEL. THE WAL FLOWED INTO A ROADSIDE DITCH, INTO A TRIBUTARY TO GLADE RUN CREEK, AND THEN INTO GLADE RUN CREEK (LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 1.2 MILES DOWNSTREAM FROM THE INCIDENT SITE).     WAL IS A BYPRODUCT OF PENRECO’S MINERAL OIL MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IT IS AN ALKALINE WATER THAT IS BENEFICIALLY USED FOR THE TREATMENT OF ACID MINE DRAINAGE (AMD) BY SITES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY COAL MINING ACTIVITIES. THE ALKALINE WATER IS MIXED WITH AMD AT THE SITES TO NEUTRALIZE THE ACIDIC DRAINAGE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SURFACE WATER BEFORE IT IS DISCHARGED TO A RECEIVING STREAM. THE BYPRODUCT IS APPROVED FOR SUCH BENEFICIAL USE UNDER GENERAL PERMIT WMGRO8O. THE WAL WAS IN TRANSIT TO AN APPROVED MINE DRAINAGE SITE IN CADOGAN, PENNSYLVANIA.     IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCIDENT, SAND WAS DEPLOYED AT THE SITE TO CONTAIN ANY OIL THAT COULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM THE ENGINE OR THE FUEL TANKS OF THE TRUCK. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO GALLONS OF MOTOR OIL, NO HYDROCARBONS WERE RELEASED FROM THE VEHICLE. ALL OF THE HYDROCARBONS WERE ABSORBED BY THE SAND WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF A FEW DROPLETS FOUND ON THE GROUND SURFACE NEAR THE SITE. ANY MATERIAL CONTAMINATED WITH HYDROCARBONS WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE IN A ROLL-OFF BOX AND SENT FOR DISPOSAL TO THE WASTE MANAGEMENT LANDFILL IN WEST SUNBURY, PENNSYLVANIA. AFTER THE REMOVAL OF THE SAND AND OTHER CONTAMINATED MATERIAL, THE DRAINAGE DITCH WAS FLUSHED WITH 1,500 GALLONS OF WATER FROM THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT TANK TRUCK. THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE CLEAR IN THE MORNING BUT THEN RAIN BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 PM AND LASTED THROUGHOUT THE EVENING RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL FLUSHING. OFFICIALS FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (PA DEP) WERE ON SITE AND WERE UPDATED REGARDING ANY PROGRESS AND CLEANUP EFFORTS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE OFFICIALS AGREED THAT THERE WAS NO FURTHER REMEDIAL ACTION REQUIRED DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE MATERIAL RELEASED INTO THE WATER.     THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE DISPATCHED AN ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION TEAM TO THE   INCIDENT SCENE TO GATHER INFORMATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT.

Weather conditions were extreme ice fog with limited visibility. A tractor trailer had spun out and two other tractor trailer units had stopped to prevent hitting the unit. The Flying J unit came over the hill and noticed both units stopped on the interstate. The Flying J unit immediately veered to the right to avoid a rear end collision. While attempting the maneuver, the pup trailer collided with the trailer of the stopped tractor trailer unit causing a puncture in the pup trailer. As a result of impact, the rear compartment of the pup lost 1721 gallons of no-lead gasoline. Emergency response crews were immediately dispatched from the Denver, CO and Salt Lake City, UT areas. The fuel escaped the Pup and entered the adjacent shoulder and median soil.   Flying J Response Crews employed a vapor extraction system and recovered ll40 of the 1721 gallons lost. The remaining fuel was removed by excavation, escaped into the bedrock or through evaporation.","Flying J Transportation drivers have been reminded to use judgment during bad weather conditions. In this case, the driver was proceeding 40 MPH in a 75 MPH zone.

Victoria Drive, Lees Summit, MO.    Apria employee John Bullington was in the process of filling a HL 190, non-specification cargo tank, mounted in the box on an Isuzu truck. When he attempted to close the stand tank fill line valve he found that the valve was frozen to the point he could not turn it. After making unsuccessful attempts to turn the valve he started to disengage the fill line. As the line came loose a flow of oxygen, refrigerated liquid commenced. As he was unable to close the stand tank valve he pointed the hose up into the air, between the vehicle and the stand tank, over the concrete parking area. He immediately yelled for assistance and a fellow employee contacted the supervisor who had notification made to the Lees Summit Fire Department. The surrounding area was immediately closed to all foot and vehicular traffic. Contact was made with the Apria Lenexa transfill facility for technical assistance and the required corporate notifications were made.    Upon arrival of the Lees Summit Fire Department they observed the incident and after contacting  EPA and DNR made the determination that the flow of oxygen, refrigerated liquid was low enough and that it was converting to vapor which was dispersing into an open field and did not constitute a hazard. They would stand by in case of an emergency until Apria staff could either close the valve or the leak terminated.    By approximately 0845 hours Dan Armstrong, Apria Transfill Supervisor had arrived and closed the valve, terminating the release. The fire department checked the area and determined that the situation was secure.    It was determined that approximately 1178 gallons of oxygen, refrigerated liquid had been released, converted to vapor and dispersed into the atmosphere.     There were no injuries or collateral damage.",Immediately upon the fire departments assessment that the scene was secure a question and answer session was held with both the Apria staff and the on-scene members of the Lees Summit Fire Department. The functionality of the stand tank and the filling process were reviewed as well as actions to take in case of malfunctioning equipment.    Additional in-service training on the filling process and troubleshooting is being conducted with the Apria Healthcare staff .,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,539,"Apria Healthcare, Inc.",US,

I then checked in the nose of the trailer for any residue and there was a small wet spot on the floor of the trailer and it also smelled of chemicals. I then questioned the DSR Afredo Beas (UST) whether he had noticed anything unusual while unloading the trailer and I informed him of the spill. He stated that he did not smell anything but did notice that the bottom of a pallet of boxes was wet. The DSR stated that the freight did not have any blocking or bracing around it. The freight was also placed on a substandard quality pallet and the box in question was on the corner bottom of the pallet. The pallet was listed as a leave on. The fact that the puddle was under the trailer leads me to believe that the freight was punctured while unloading.",It is my recommendation that the DSR Alfredo Beas receive written discipline in regards to the handling of this freight.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

Product drained into lining of tank. The loader stopped loading, cleaned up spill, and the driver called David Dygert at his home terminal at about 22:00 hrs to report spill. Loader finished loading tank. Driver said everything appeared to be alright. The driver left shipper (Eastman) at 0 1:30 hrs on 10/12/36. While in transit the trailer started smoking and caught fire inside lining due to the hot Product in the insulation. The driver put out fire with water and returned to the shop for inspection of trailer. The shipper was responsible for all loading and securing of the load.

CSX Transportation dispatched Hepaco Environmental (John Francisco 804-363-4957) to investigate. Hepaco arrived on site and discovered a faint odor coming from the suspected tank car. After further investigation it was discovered that the manway gasket was not seated correctly in the manway cover due to rust build up. It was also determined that one manway bolt was stripped and would not stay tool tight. Hepaco changed out the manway gasket and replaced it with a nozzle gasket and tightened the manway as tight as it would allow. The car was placed in bad order status awaiting the shipper to get the stripped manway bolt replaced. Car was moved around yard and no visible odors or product were visible.

The two tank cars were safely isolated in the yard and the emergency response plan was activated. A CSXT contractor was dispatched to the scene to inspect the cars. GATX 46566 was found with the liquid valve on the A end in the open position. It took 1/2 a turn to close the valve. Both the A and B liquid valve plugs were not installed. The plugs were replaced and tool tightened. Using an ammonia solution, it was confirmed that the leak was stopped. The PPGX 1713 was inspected and found not to be leaking.

The passengers were deplaned and the fire department, city of phoenix police department and the hazmat team arrived and assessed the bag and the 32 oz bottle of broken ""l2000 liquid""  Methylmethacrylate monomer. the police escorted the pax,  Giang Tran, to the ramp area to be questioned. They discovered 3 other 32 oz bottles of the same liquid in his bag. Roy Morales, FAA, contacted operations and asked that I contact  Craig Burns, the Regional FAA HAZMAT inspector, I was unable to contact Craig Burns and called Mr. Morales back and inquired what evidence I needed to obtain from the scene. Mr. Morales informed me to call Michael Givens, the supervisor at the National Response Center. I called Mr. Givens at 1708. He conferenced Mr. William Clark and I explained the details of the incident. I provided the flight number, aircraft type/number, passenger information (including pax itineray, address, phone number and bag claim number). Mr. Givens and Mr. Clark advised me to take pictures of the HAZMAT and send an initial report with the pictures to Mr. Clark.
