The normal process for this delivery is to park along the front(North) side of this company (Shapco Printing), unload drums from the truck via a power lift gate. Once the drums are set onto the street the driver at this time carts them up a slight rise onto the sidewalk and into the customers facility. While the driver was in the process of carting the drum up the slight rise to the sidewalk the drum bounced up free of the bottom cart feet and slid downward. The sliding motion of the drum against the feet of the drum cart caused a slight slit in the drum causing the product release. When the drum came to rest is was next to the curb and close proximity to the storm drain grate, the driver at this point heard a slight pressure release from the drum (the slit area)and imediately  rolled the drum so the slit was facing up which isolated the product from leaking.  The duration of the product release was less than 1 minute.  The slit that occured in the drum was approximately 1/8 inch long with a 1/16 inch opening.  The position of the slit in the side of the drum was 10 inches upward from the bottom chime.  With verification from the fire dept, by the time they arrived on scene the product that leaked out had evaporated.  When it was determined safe to move this drum, the slit was plugged with an epoxy compound and moved into the printing facility whereas it was their intent to transfer into another package and use the material.",It is my recomendation to utilize the loading dock at this facility to unload drums (this has not been an option in the past due to other facility conflicting issues).

Driver immediately pulled into the Petro Truck Stop at Exit 4 off Interstate 44.  Mid-America Environmental of Carthage, Missouri was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, Mid-America Environmental inspected the trailer, and discovered one (1) 55-gallon drum, which had released 3/4 of its contents inside the trailer.  Approximately 2 gallons also released to the asphalt beneath the trailer.  Mid-America Environmental utilized absorbent material to clean the affected trailer floor, contaminated freight, and affected asphalt.  Mid-America Environmental offloaded the majority of freight to access the leaking drum, and overpacked the leaker into one (1) 85-gallon overpack.  The spent absorbent material was placed into three (3) 55-gallon steel recovery drums.  The freight was reloaded, and sent on to its destination.  One (1) 85-gallon overpack, and three (3) 55-gallon steel recovery drums were placed back on the Roadrunner Dawes Freight Systems, Inc. trailer, pending disposition from the shipper.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be related to heavy freight crushing the drum, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

BNSF personnel inspected all buildings and other facilities looking for the odor source. Later in the morning, PSPX 21501 in the railyard was indicated as the odor source. Product odor was detected at ground level emanating from PSPX 21501 and it was isolated in the railyard. BNSF responders inspected PSPX 21501 and determined that possibly some product on the exterior shell may have been the odor source; as valves and fittings appeared secured. Later, shipper contract responders inspected PSPX 21501. These responders found the liquid line/liquid valve approximately 1/4 turn open with the corresponding closure plug 1/2 turn less than tool tight. Responders closed the liquid line vale and tool tightened the plug. All other fittings, along with the outage, were checked by the responders. The outage appeared proper and all other fittings were secure. Responders found no evidence that the product in the liquid state had escaped from PSPX 21501, only the odorous product vapor. Subsequently, the odor was no longer detectable and the response was concluded by 1600 hrs.

While off-loading last compartment, the tank overfilled.  FRTL driver immediately shut down flow of product.  The excess fuel overflowed into vapor hoses and tubes on FRTL trailer.  The vapor tube pressure release valve opened to relieve pressure and approximately 100 gallons spilled onto the ground.  Customer personnel immediately began cleanup.  All spilled fuel was contained and did not go into any drains or soil.  Customer personnel stuck their tank and realized the veeder root indicator was incorrect by approximately 1000 gallons.

Driver pulled through 2 DOT scale houses the last being at Vinton, LA (33 miles away from Port Arthur, TX) no leaks were discovered as the trailer went thorugh the scale. Trailer arrived at Veolia in Port Arthur, TX and while doing a walk around inspection, it was discovered that a small amount of liquid was leaking from the rear of the trailer. Trailer was immediately put into a containment area and decontamination and cleanup was done. 4 drums were discovered leaking around their center rings. It appears they were crushed while loading. Trailer has sealed wood floors which appear to have contained most of the leak. Trailer wood floors have absorbed some of the spill and will be removed and properly disposed of. Transporter is entering this incident into a corrective action process and will be assessing secondary containment adequacies and  retraining employees to reduce the risk of re-occurance. Our best estimates suggest that the possible length of release from the trailer was over about 33 miles in the which only about 4 gallons are unaccounted for.","All Drivers will be retrained cargo securement, package inspection and shipment acceptance proceedures, in route cargeo and equipment inspection, incident reporting.

Our driver had all of the neccessary protective gear on but the plant person did not.  When they finally got the nut/cap off with a pair of channel locks leftover product trapped in the cavity between the internal and external sprayed out due to the ball valve inside the bleeder valve handle being broken.

While at a truck stop off of US Route 35 westbound, free product was discovered leaking from the trailer.  The Gallia County Emergency Management Agency, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and the Springfield Fire Department responded to assess the site.  The Springfield Fire Department applied absorbent material to contain the free liquid on the affected asphalt surface.  The Dow Chemical Company Emergency Response Unit and FEE Corporation of Canal Winchester, Ohio were dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Dow Chemical Company personnel investigated the trailer with assistance from personnel from FEE Corporation.  One, leaking 55-gallon drum was discovered inside of the trailer.  Absorbent material was applied inside of the trailer and additional absorbents were applied outside of the trailer.  The freight was removed from the trailer and the trailer was cleaned.  Seven, 55-gallon drums of contaminated absorbent material were generated as a result of the incident.  The damaged 55-gallon drum was placed into an overpack drum and was placed back on the trailer for shipment.  FEE Corporation transported seven, 55-gallon drums of contaminated absorbent material to their facility in Canal Winchester, Ohio pending disposal coordination.  FEE Corporation returned to the site on Tuesday November 28, 2006 and powerwashed the affected asphalt surface at the request of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.  One vacuum truck containing approximately 150 gallon of contaminated water was generated as a result of the powerwashing and was transported by FEE Corporation to their facility in Canal Winchester, Ohio pending disposal coordination.  The Ohio Department of Transportation investigated the site and deemed the cleanup satisfactory.","Since the release was accidental and may have been related to a puncture during loading, no actions have been taken to prevent recurrence.

Driver conducted pre-trip inspection, but failed to climb onto cargo tanker to verify that operator had secured the dome lid properly for transport.  As driver proceeded out of the facility yard on Possum Hollow Road, climbing up and down hills, material began to move (""sloshing"") in the cargo tanker.  As driver turned from Possum Hollow Road onto Horton Road, material began to leak from dome and driver notice the leaking in his mirrors as he drove down Horton Road.  He proceeded to drive to a safe location to stop his vehicle on Horton Road.  He pulled off to the side of the road on Horton, and inspected the tanker.  Since he was only one to two minutes out from the facility, he called the plant for assistance.  Stopping the vehicle from movement and securing the dome mitigated the release.  Fire department and third party contractor for environmental clean-up arrived at the scene to remove all caustic soda material from the roadway.","The only reason for this incident is human error, personnel did not follow-up through with their job requirements for loading a cargo tanker and inspecting it for shipment.  Disciplinary action was taken against both the driver and the operator who loaded the tanker.

Dispatch made notification of the service for that day but failed to note it for the next day of service. The truck was dispatched the next day with the failed plumbing. Dispatch overlooked the out of service plumbing documentation. Driver arrived at the unload point and was unaware of the disasembled plumbing. Driver started the unloading process but was unable to stop the 100-gallon release that occured during this unloading incident because he was unaware of the disasembled plumbing.,A detailed analysis that addresses the root cause of this incident will be shared with all shop foremans and shop personnel.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected FPAX 931031 finding that the 165 psi frangible disc had ruptured, which allowed some product to escape from this orifice. No liquid product was found, only dried white powdery residue on the top and sides of this tank car. No product impacted the ground. The responder replaced the ruptured frangible disc with a 100 psi frangible disc, the only frangible disc available in his response vehicle. The responder wiped as much residue product from the top and side shell as he could safely reach. The train with FPAX 931031 was released to proceed at 1405 hrs. MST, 11/18/06.

Driver looked at the top of the trailer and noticed vapor coming from an opening on top of the trailer. He returned to the top of the trailer and found a clean out cap on the rear of the trailer was loose. He tightened the cap and climbed down from the trailer. He looked up again and still saw vapor escaping from the top of the trailer, this time from the front. He again climbed up and discovered the front clean out was not installed.

I arrived on scene at approximately 10:30 am with an empty oil truck to pump over the remaining oil. I found multiple fire fighting equipment, PG county police cars, and MDE on the scene. The PETRO oil delivery truck was laying on its driver’s side, rear of truck down hill from the road and completely off of the pavement. The weld from the tank was cracked and leaking. MDE cut holes in the side of the container and pumped over the oil from the over turned oil truck. Driver went to the hospital for observations, and submitted to a Drug - Alcohol test, which results, showed no influences.      I spoke to John Myers from MDE oil control and we discussed the weather that was forecast for late in the day and the next day, with thunderstorm and heavy rain expected. John advised me that he would like the oil cleaned up as soon as possible to keep from dispersing the oil and contaminating the wells on either side of the release.    We advised John that Tri-county was here and starting the process of cleaning up.  After about an hour Tri-county still had no equipment on the scene, we spoke to Jeff Molner from MDE and it was determined to have a second cleanup crew on-site. We called Paul over at Atlas environmental services, (we use Atlas in Virginia to do tank work) and asked him if we needed him would he be available to respond. Which he responded he would, I advised him of the size of the release so he could start to get a plan together and I would call him back. Paul from Atlas was called and discussed the size of the response,    We concluded that we would need   1. 1 small tracked excavator  2. 1 bobcat tracked  3. 1 large excavator  4. 8 dump trucks    We continued to have Tri-county ‘s vacuum truck keep cleaning up the liquid product.  When they were through cleaning up the liquid product we released them from the scene. By that time Atlas had 8 dump trucks the bobcat, and small excavator on sight and moving contaminated soil to a staging area to load the dump trucks when the large excavator got on scene.    The excavator arrived around 4:30, which then started to load contaminated soil onto the dump trucks to be taken to their facility until morning when the soil could be taken to a disposal site. The excavation continued until 10:00 pm and all 8 dump trucks had been filled and the street was cleared of debris. We left the scene with Atlas to return in the morning to resume clean up.

This caused two rail cars (UTLX 208096 & GATX 202155) in the CSX train to derail. UTLX 208096 rolled over on to it’s top shearing off the liquid eduction valve resulting in a release of  1,000 gallons of product. NS RR responded Sunpro to clean up the spill and transfer the remaining product to frac tanks. The consignee, Marathon Petroleum, arranged for motor carrier trucks to deliver their product to destination at Hammond, IN, from the frac tanks. The cause of the derailment was an improperly loaded car in the NS train. This incident was reported to Chemtrec on report #11122006015.

J875,JACKSONVILLE,FL,32202,Carrier,"On November 20th, 2006, 1615 hours, a car inspector noticed UTLX 48206 dripping product from the bottom outlet cap. The car inspector notified Frontier Yard Control, and the TERP Plan was initiated. The tank car was isolated and the PSCC was notified, CSXT HazMat Sentinel, Steve Myers was notifed and CSXT HazMat Mgr., M. Bethge, was also notified. A CSXT HazMat Emergency Response Contractor was called to assist in the response and cleanup of the released product. Sentinel S. Myers, placed a bucket under the bottom outlet valve to contain spilled product and tighten the bottom outlet cap one full turn. This slowed the drippage to 1 drop every two minutes. HazMat Mgr. M. Bethge, upon investigation, found that the internal ball valve was not fully closed. This was due to the operating handle making contact with the stop plate/securement pin plate, preventing the ball valve to close fully. The valve remained open approximately 1/16 to 1/8 inch. Excess wear was noted in the pin/allen bolt that connects the operating handle to the external section of the valve stem. CSXT emergency response contractor closed the bottom outlet valve fully, drained the unloading extention pipe, inspected the 4” cap gasket and the 2” plug threads. All items were found in good order, therefore, re-applied the cap and plug and tightened tool tight and wire sealed the handle back tight to the stop plate to insure that the valve would remain closed. UTLX 48206 was released for disposition.
