Driver alleges he looked down at his gauges and when he looked up he had made contact with the concrete divider in the center of the roadway. He overcorrected causing a sudden shift in the liquid. The tractor and trailer overturned on top of the concrete divider. The shell of the cargo tank was punctured on impact. Highway patrol was called by passing motorist. Highway patrol and fire department arrived at the scene. One puncture was located near the center of the tank at the read and one puncture was located near the center of the tank mid center. The release lasted about 4 hours. The cargo tank and tractor were uprighted by a local wrecker service and removed from the scene. Spill Center was notified and they made the necessary notifications to all related agencies. Driver was not injured. Carrier safety personnel arrived to assist in the recovery.,This driver received comprehensive training on rollover prevention during his orientation two months prior to this accident.

While performing a final inspection of the shipment, it was discovered that a 55-gallon drum containing an acetone/osmium tetroxide flammable liquid toxic mixture was leaking.  Approximately 1 gallon of the material had leaked through holes on the side of the drum onto the floor of the trailer.  The leaking drum was overpacked into an 85-gallon drum.  The material that had leaked onto the floor of the trailer was cleaned up with speedi-dry and absorbant pads.  The cleanup materials were placed into the 85-gallon overpack along with the leaking drum for disposal.","It was determined this spill was caused due to poor integrity of the 55-gallon drum.  In the future, composite poly lined steel (6HA) drums will be used for this material.

While moving from one field to another, he made a left turn from Geer Road to Alderson Road and rolled tank. Responsible party called9-1-1. Responding agencies--County FD, CHP, Haz-mat unit from Stanislaus County Dept of Env. Resources were dispatched. A company rep was also sent to the scene. A liquid valve on top of the tank was sheared off.Tank was on its side with vapor leaking from sheared valve. Tank was relocated approx. 50 yards to the east to nprevent downwind exposure. Tank was then uuprighted and vapor valve was opened to release pressure from tank and prevent liquid release. However, liquid was released which vaporized upon atmospheric exposure. Internal valve failed to completely close at sheared valve.Due to risks of attempting to stop leak and the lack of downwind exposure considerations. Vapor contined to be released from the tank for approx. 5 hours. Approx. 750 gallons of water were used to shield personnel while opening vapor valves and to direct vapor cloud from time to time. All incident operations were approved by the IC (CHP Officer Jerry Kessler #10715).","Drivers need to slow down while towing equipment; remind all customers that ammonia regulators need to be removed from valves during transit; label tanks re; removal of regulators from valves during transit. On March 30, 2005, Stanislaus Farm Supply hosted an ammonia training for employees, customers, local fire departments, and Stanislaus County Department of Environmental Resources haz-mat team. I believe that this training was very helpful at this incident. Stanislaus Farm Supply will continue to help train local responders, employees and customers in the safe handling of ammonia products.

During the unloading process it was discovered that a 5-gallon bucket was leaking through the lid.  The driver immediately phoned for a clean-up crew.      Upon arrival to the site, it was determined that approximately 1 gallon of Greasestrip Plus had been released onto the floor of the transport trailer.     The initial site evaluation revealed two areas of contamination. The first area was at the rear of the trailer and was approximately one foot by one foot in size. The second area was near the front of the trailer and was approximately two feet by two feet.     Clay absorbent was applied liberally to each area. The sorbent was then pushed across the contaminated area repeatedly with a stiff bristle broom. After the area had been worked for about half and hour, the sorbent material was pushed aside and fresh sorbent was added. After 15 minutes, that sorbent was also moved aside. A scraping bar was then used to scrape off any material that had dried and become stuck to the floor of the trailer. Any visible lumps or dark spots in the contaminated areas were scraped flat and the contaminant was removed. After scraping, the clay sorbent was swept over the areas again to pick up any remnants of the contaminant. The Clay sorbent was then swept up and placed in a 30 gallon open top poly drum. The drum was then sent off for disposal at a permitted solid waste management facility.  The entire on site cleanup took approximately 1 hour.","It was unclear as to what caused this drum to leak.

THE TRUCK/TRAILER WAS LOADING AT RACK 3 AT THE AGRIUM, WEST SACRAMENTO FACILITY AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. STATEMENTS FROM VARIOUS PLANT PERSONNEL WERE TAKEN (EH&S SUPERVISOR). THERE WERE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT TWO AMMONIA LOADING CONTROL SYSTEMS, THE OLDER USING BROOKS METERS AND AT THE TIME, ONLY ON RACKS 3 & 4, AND THE NEWER DIGITAL CONTROL SYSTEM (DCS) CONTROLLING RACKS 1 & 2. THE BROOKS METERES REQUIRE THE INPUT OF THE TARGET NET WEIGHT OF AMMONIA AND THE DCE REQUIRES TARGET GROSS WEIGHT.

THE SYSTEM ATTEMPTED TO DELIVER AN EXCESS AMOUNT OF AMMONIA TO THE TRUCK. AS THE TANK FILLED BEYOND ITS INTENDED CAPACITY, THE PRESSURE ROSE RAPIDLY IN THE REDUCED HEAD SPACE SLOWING THE FILL-RATE AND THE PSV OPENED. SHIFT PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE RELEASE BY STOPPING THE LOADING AND MOVING PERSONS IN THE AREA. ADMINISTRATION PERSONNEL WERE MADE AWARE OF THE RELEASE AND SUBSEQUENTLY ALSO RESPONDED.    REGULATORY AND NEIGHBOR NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE BY PLANT PERSONNEL. NO INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OCCURED.    IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CALCULATED BY ENGINEERING SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT APPROXIMATELY 48 LBS OF AMMONIA IN VAPOR FORM WERE RELEASED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. A REVIEW OF DIGITAL RECORDINGS OF THE SECURITY CAMERAS SHOWED THE INCIDENT FROM THE CAMERA ON THE AREA WAREHOUSE AND THAT THE CLOUD DID NOT VISIBLY MIGRATE OFF SITE.    Causes  1.

The Box was then loaded and secured onto the transportation truck.  At the time the K-max box was loaded the drain plugs were not installed.  The truck then started movement to the final destination.  The truck was on the road for about 100 Miles when the drive saw something smoking on the back of his truck. The Driver called in the spill and a Halliburton HSE Coordinator responded.  Halliburton Called a third party clean up crew to mitigate the spill and clean up the area.  Further investigation showed there was a hair line crack on the side of one of the HCL containers.  The containers were stored outside and were stating to deteriorate due to the exposure to the elements.  Approximately 2.5 GAL of HCL leaked in the K-max box and some did spill onto the bed of the transport truck.,The five gal totes are now stored inside to prevent the damage to the container due to exposure to the elements.

THE TRACTOR-TRAILER EXITED THE INTERSTATE AND THE DRIVER OBSERVED A LIQUID SUBSTANCE COMING OUT OF THE REAR AND FRONT OF THE TRAILER.  THE BILL OF LADING INDICATED THAT SEVERAL CORROSIVE ITEMS WERE ON BOARD.  ON JUNE 2, 2005, CURA EMERGENCY SERVICES (CES) WAS CONTACTED BY KLLM TRANSPORT SERVICES TO MANAGE THE CLEAN UP OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT.  CES CONTACTED THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE TO GAIN SUPPORTING INFORMATION ON THIS RELEASE.  THE DRIVER INFORMED CES AS TO WHAT WAS ON BOARD THE TRAILER AND MADE CES AWARE THAT HE NOTICED A LEAK COMING FROM THE FRONT AND REAR OF THE TRAILER.  THE MATERIAL WAS OBSERVED POOLING UP UNDER NEATH THE TRAILER ON THE ROAD SHOULDER.  BASED ON THE INFORMATION GIVEN, CES DISPATCHED A CREW FROM WEAVERTOWN ENVIRONMENTAL TO PERFORM A SITE ASSESSMENT AND NECESSARY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ON SITE.  ON JUNE 2, 2005, A CREW FROM THE WEAVERTOWN ENVIRONMENTAL MOBILIZED TO THE SITE AND OBSERVED A SLOW LEAK COMING FROM THE FRONT AND REAR OF THE TRAILER.  THE CREW SOLIDIFIED THE RELEASE UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER WITH ABSORBENTS AND HAND EXCAVATED THE SPENT ABSORBENTS.  WEAVERTOWN TECHNICIANS DONNED LEVEL () PPE AND ENTERED THE TRAILER TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE.  ONCE INSIDE, THE CREW FOUND TWO 55-GALLON DRUMS OF ADVANTAGE PLUS AND ONE 55-GALLON DRUM OF SULFURIC ACID LEAKING.  IT APPEARED THAT THE DRUMS SUFFERED DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF A LOAD SHIFT.  ONCE THE RELEASE WAS CONTAINED THE TRACTOR-TRAILER WAS MOVED OFF OF THE RAMP AND THE CREW OFF-LOADED THE TRAILER FOR DECONTAMINATION.  THE CREW SPREAD FLOOR DRY INSIDE THE TRAILER AND WORKED THEM IN.  THE SPENT ABSORBENTS WERE COLLECTED INTO DRUMS FOR DISPOSAL.  THE DAMAGED DRUMS WERE OVERPACKED AND PLACED BACK ON THE TRAILER.

As he opened the second valve, he heard product coming up the induction pipe and then a light pop sound.  At that moment, product started spraying out between the flange that we attach our fitting too and the flange for the induction tube.  The duration of the release lasted for approximately 30 minutes.    The loader descended the railcar and got away from spray that was being released.  Another loader located on an acid rack two cars away noticed the incident and immediately went to the air line pressurizing the railcar and disconnected the air hose at the source.

When attempting to turn around, the driver backed into a parking/driveway area to a maintenance building where he backed into a hoist. The arm on the hoist punctured the back upper right side of the cargo tank creating a 3 inch long slit and dented the cargo tank (16 inches in diameter by 1.5 inches deep) Approximately 1.5 barrels of crude oil leaked onto the private road and driveway. The Conoco/Phillips refinery employees responded to the incident, immediately unloaded 70 barrels of the crude oil into a vacuum truck and cleaned up the spill. A NCRA truck was dispatched to the location to completely unload the damaged truck and the vacuum truck. The media cleaned up was disposed at a non-haz landfarm at the Conoco/Phillips refinery. The total incident took approximately 3 hours.",The post incident review indicated that the driver was nervous when he realized he was on a private drive adjacent to the refinery. He was reprimanded for improper backing and not following defensive driving skills.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5075,National Cooperative Refinery Association,US,

The lading was received and a sample was obtained through the man-way dome by an Eli Lilly employee.  The man-way closure gasket fell out of its seat during sampling and was replaced in the gasket seat before closing the man-way by the Eli Lilly sampling operator.  All dome wing nuts were hand tightened with one being tightened further with the use of a tool.  Tanker was then relocated to the holding area just west of the sampling rack by the carrier (Frick Trucking) until Eli Lilly Quality Control approval was obtained.  After Eli Lilly Quality Control approval, the cargo tank was enroute via Frick Trucking to the appropriate unloading station when an Eli Lilly employee noticed that the tanker was leaking as it was stopped at a STOP sign.  The truck had traveled 400 feet from the Quality Control Approval staging truck pad to the STOP sign where the leak was discovered.  The truck was held at this point by the Eli Lilly employee and Eli Lilly security was contacted.  The on-site Eli Lilly Emergency Response Team responded to the spill and spread Sodium Carbonate to to neutralize the acid.  The Sodium Carbonate was collected and drummed for disposal.  An investigation was conducted and the primary cause of the leak was determined as the man-way gasket becoming dislodged from it's seat preventing a tight seal.  As the truck started and stopped, the Sulfuric Acid spilled out from under the man-way closure.   The closure gasket alignment was corrected and the man-way closure was tightened down securely by the Eli Lilly Emergency Response Team.  The truck was then moved to the unloading station by the Frick Trucking driver to be unloaded by DOT trained Eli Lilly operators according to Eli Lilly procedure.

The tanker was then relocated to an on site tanker pad by Eli Lilly operators. On 06-24-2005 outside carrier Liquid Transport Corporation came in to get trailer #TT321R67 for delivery to Eli Lilly and Company, Clinton Laboratories, Clinton, IN for incineration of the liquid waste . Liquid Transport hooked up to tanker #TT321R67 and  proceeded toward the Tippecanoe Laboratories exit gate (Security Headquarters). Prior to the tanker exiting the plant site, two Eli Lilly employees noticed the tanker dripping and smelled a strong solvent smell as the truck passed them. The two Eli Lilly employees notified Tippecanoe Laboratories Security of their observations. Investigation by Tippecanoe Laboratories Security discovered that the man-way dome had not been fastened down after loading, allowing the tanker contents to spill out onto the plant site roadway.    The man way dome was then secured tightly by the Liquid Transport driver and was then checked by Eli Lilly personnel.

Once unloading was complete, driver tried tightening packing nut on the ""A"" valve and was successful.  Driver verified that neither valve leaked.

He drove the vehicle to a safe location (intersection of Alico Road, West of I-75 in western Florida)and notified the shipper, Allied Universal Corp. of Medley, FL. He spoke to the Branch Manager, Bernie Thompson.  Mr. Thompson was unable to respond to the scene immediately to mitigate any chlorine release from the tank as he and his responders were three hours from the scene.  Mr. Thompson called 911.  The San Carlos Fire Department responded to the scene at 14:00:00 hours.  The public responders determined a small vapor release from the fusible plug of one chlorine multi unit tank car tank. Area of leak could not be seen by human eye, no hole or other damage visible.  The responders evacuated the Hess Gas Station (number of people evacuated unknown), and proceeded to mitigate the release of chlorine vapor by applying the Chlorine Institute Emergency B Kit device.  Once the kit was securely in place and the release terminated, the TSUI driver was released from the scene at 16:00:00 hours to return to the Allied Medley, Florida facility.  At the facility, the container was to be unloaded of its product and inspected.",Multi unit tank car tank inspected at the shipper's facility.  Fusible plug thread wear/deterioration determined to be the cause of the incident.  Employees tasked with filling the multi unit tank car tanks retrained on thread inspection and container inspection per Chlorine Institute Pamphlet 17 as well as company operating policy for filling containers.,No,TANK CAR,Multi-unit,106AX,Yes,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,0,Allied Universal Corporation,US,

George Gluck, Fleurchem’s CEO, together with Louis Mercun, Fleurchem’s Director of Operations, opened the cargo trailer  and noticed an immediate odor. Fleurchem had been expecting a shipment of 80 drums of acetaldehyde but Mr. Gluck noticed that the containers had no hazardous markings identifying this shipment as a hazardous material shipment. Although he noticed an odor, he did not see any liquid or other visual sign of a release.. They used an explosive- level meter and determined, based on the lower explosive limit (LEL) reading, that they should leave the back of the cargo trailer door slightly open overnight in the secure area of Fleurchem’s gated site and re-check the LEL level in the morning.  The next morning the LEL level was normal and there was no odor. An inspection revealed a tiny pinhole on the seam of one drum approximately 6” from its top. The pinhole appeared to have sealed itself, as no tI.irther vapor was being dispersed. The measurement of the remaining acetaldehyde indicated that 12 kilos had been released from the drum. There was no bulging or noticeable defect in any of the other special pressurized drums.","Fleurchem identified two areas of concern in connection with this incident. .First, there was the lack of hazardous identification markings in connection with this shipment. Second, one of the containers transporting the materials appeared to be defective.  Fleurchem notified each involved party (both in China and here) of the problems with this shipment and the need (1) to ensure compliance with both IMDG and USDOT hazardous materials codes and regulations, and (2) when possible, to conduct appropriate inspections of hazardous materials containers.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"FLEURCHEM, INC.",US,

West Sacramento Nitrogen Operations  Addendum to Form DOT F 5800.1  Ammonia Release of June 8, 2005  Part VI- Description of Events and Release  A Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) on a ammonia trailer operated by Button Transportation opened and released ammonia to the atmosphere. The truck/trailer was loading at Rack 3 at the Agrium, West Sacramento facility at the time of the incident. Statements from various Plant personnel were taken by John Killey (EH&S Supervisor). There were at ihe time of the incident two ammonia loading control systems, the older using Brooks meters and at the time, only on Racks 3 & 4, and the newer Digital Control System (DCS) controlling Racks 1 & 2. The Brooks meters require the input of the target net weight of ammonia and the DCS requires target gross weight. The operator was busy with several trucks at the time and erroneously keyed in a gross weight to an instrument that required a net weight approximately 40,000 lbs less. The system attempted to deliver an excess amount of ammonia to the truck. As the tank filled beyond it’s intended capacity, the pressure rose rapidly in the reduced head space slowing the fill-rate and the PSV opened. Shift personnel responded to the release by stopping the loading and moving persons in the area. Administration personnel were made aware of the release and subsequently also responded.  Regulatory and neighbor notifications were made by Plant personnel. No injuries or property damage occurred.  It was subsequently calculated by engineering support personnel that approximately 48 lbs of ammonia in vapor form were released to the atmosphere. A review of digital recordings of the security cameras showed the incident from the camera on the urea warehouse and that the cloud did not visibly migrate off site.  Causes  1. Incorrect load number input.  2. Two systems operable at the same time.  3. Failure to check/monitor/correct input error or monitor loading process.  4. Failure to communicate/coordinate — did not ask for help as task load increased.  Part VII- Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence  1. Provide training to cover:  i. At the truck racks, if there is a problem, initiate the stop then evaluate the problem. “Stop then think”.  ii. For scale-house personnel; emphasizing the need to be in the scale house when ammonia loading is taking place and not to attempt to deal with too many trucks simultaneously.",,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,AGRIUM US INC,US,
