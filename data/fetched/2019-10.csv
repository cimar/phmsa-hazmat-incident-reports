MGR. TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE,1 EDEN LN,FLANDERS,NJ,07836-8950,Other-10 day in-transit facili,"On the morning of 10/9/2019, Veolia employees discovered that a tote of a caustic solution  containing sodium hydroxide was slightly leaking. The tote had shipped from General Electric on  10/02/2019. This morning (10/9/2019), upon arrival at the Veolia 10-day facility in Schenectady, NY, employees observed a leak from a trailer that was parked overnight at the Veolia 10-day transfer  facility. Employees attempted to determine where the tote was leaking as only small drips from the  container were noticed. Employees identified a small cut in the sidewall of a plastic tote and decided to transfer the contents of the tote into another tote.    After transferring the contents of the leaking tote, employees investigated the source of the leaking  tote. A small scrape and cut was visible in the sidewall of the plastic container. It is assumed that a  forklift caused the damage at the original shipper location as the containers were not moved at the  Veolia 10-day transfer facility.    Employees cleaned up the less than 2-gallons of solution in the back of the original transport vehicle as well as a small amount of solution that made it to the ground at the Veolia Schenectady, NY  10 day in-transit facility. The material that was placed into a new tote was sent to Stablex in Canada for appropriate disposal without any further issues. All spill clean up material was also collected and  sent for appropriate waste disposal.",Veolia's best guess as to what happened was that the tote was damaged by the original offeror of  the shipment. Veolia will notify the customer that better care should be used when handling totes and to try and avoid damaging the totes when using a forklift.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The caller stated that the released product was contained to the trailer floor and asphalt beneath.  The caller is requested a contractor due to the hazardous state and waste amount that is in the trailer and on the asphalt. There were no drains, soils or waterways reported to have been impacted by the release. Hexamethyldisilazane contacted the trailer floor it was evaporated by the time the contractors were mitigating the hazard, it does have a vapor pressure of 13.8 mm Hg at 25 deg C (pubchem). Contractors could tell the pallet was impacted. The pallet was cut up and containerized into a 55 DM. The drum was missing ~10-15 gallons. The cause appeared to be from impact with a sharp or protruding object about 2/3 from the bottom of the drum. After applying positive pressure with a intrinsically safe ram fan, contractors then verified the site was clean by utilizing a 5 gas monitor with a Photo Ionizing Detector (Hexamethyldisilazane, IP 8.5) and combustible gas indicator that verified the lower explosive limit to be 0%.

The release has been absorbed by the cardboard underneath and the pails need to be containerized. XPO requested a team to respond Monday, 10/21 to containerize the pails. ERTS contacted Alpha-Omega. On 10/21 AOTC arrived on site at 1100 est and located a pallet of 5-gallon jerricans on the dock. The leak was due to a faulty lid/closure that spilled 0.5 gallons of CLEARLYTE® STRIPPER 200 (potassium hydroxide).

Driver reported that release was caused due to too much tension on freight strap and it sliced a small hole on top of tote. It was reported that released material has leaked out of trailer onto gravel below trailer, in parking lot area. There are no drains in the area. Driver was able to form a perimeter with oil dry creating a dam around trailer to contain release. ERTS contacted E3 Environmental to respond.

Hepcao swept the released material into (1) 55 gal fiber over-pack before applying a neutralizing agent to the trailer floor.

HEPACO tightened all four bolts and the bottom outlet valve continued to leak. UTLX 12076 was then transloaded to UTLX 41978. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Elementis Chromium (Rick McBrayer PH# 910-232-0916).

The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Ms. Gerry Sage, phone 904-349-1180. Contractor personnel installed Midland Emergency Response Capping Kit to secure the vapor release. The contents of GATX 201122 were transferred, and the car was cleaned and purged on 11/1/2019. .

Driver was moving at 32 MPH behind  another heavy vehicle.  The preceding vehicle reduced speed to make a right turn. Driver Rafael Resto reduced speed to 11 MPH and moved towards the left lane.  A vehicle described as a white  Hyundai Tucson enters the intersection in an abrupt way and when the Hyundai driver, (50  year old woman with two minor passengers)  saw the tank truck, she suddenly stopped her vehicle. As Mr. Resto hit the brakes and tries to avoid the impact to the Hyundai, the tank displaced to the right and overturned. In the impact, the tank pulled the Hyundai to the road fence at the contrary lane and it was stuck between the truck and the road fence. The Driver suffered no injuries. The Hyundai driver and the accompanying minors were unharmed. The Tank Truck and the Hyundai vehicle suffered major damages. The tank was removed with a specialized tow system and the contents of the tank was transferred to another tank truck.  Spill was treated by specialized environmental workers. Traffic was reopened by 4:00 PM.","While the main cause for the accident was the sudden entering of a vehicle into the intersection, it was not possible for the driver to spot the vehicle and avoid the accident due to the fact that the preceding vehicle blocked his view. To try to avoid this kind of situations, we will remind the drivers of the unexpected incidents that can get into their routes. We will stress the need to be very attentive to the road at all times, especially at night and dawn hours.

It was advised that approximately 7 - gallons of product impacted a 5' by 5' area of the trailer floor as well as a 5' by 8' area of the dock floor. Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) dispatched Environmental Services Inc out of South Windsor, CT to the terminal to perform cleanup activities. At 1654 ET, the contractor arrived onsite and neutralized the impacted areas with simple green and then applied granular absorbents to the impacted areas to absorb and solidify the released product. The compromised jug was over packed into one (1) 30 - gallon x - rated poly drum. The spent absorbents and debris were recovered into one (1) 55 - gallon poly drum which was over packed into one (1) 85 - gallon x - rated poly over pack drum. The contractor utilized a drager to pump out the air inside of the trailer to successfully decontaminate the trailer being a confined space. At 1934 ET, Environmental Services Inc confirmed that cleanup was complete and the waste waste staged onsite at the terminal to be managed by terminal personnel.

The driver did not realize the above ground oil tank had been removed from inside the basement and the house (subsequently) converted from oil heat to heat pump. Upon discovery of the mistake, it was evident that product had spread into entire basement and out of basement roll-up door, down driveway, and into the alley way. Driver realized problem and called manager to notify of mistake. Fire Department was already there when manager arrived.  QOC representative immediately made contact with Fire Department and Emergency Management who had already contained situation. The release occurred and initial emergency response occurred between 1710 and 1750. Emergency Management confirmed that product was contained and confined to basement, driveway (76’ from house to end of driveway) and alleyway/easement in back of house (76’ from driveway to immediate right turn out of driveway and into the alleyway). QOC, Progress Environmental, Adam Stewart, City Council, NCDENR all in agreement on actions for remediation. Progress Environmental is managing the final soil testing, remediation, and reporting.","In this case, the driver correctly followed loading and delivery procedures, except checking air flow at vent during delivery. Future training will include even more emphasis on this step in the delivery process. The other contributing factor was the driver's use of personal phone GPS to plan the trip versus the company tablet-based routing system. So, the training process going forward will stress the importance of using the company-provided routing system and increased attention to address verification upon arrival.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,21061,"QUALITY OIL COMPANY, LLC",US,

Driver did not verify the tank he was pumping into and assumed incorrectly that the acid tank was the tank on the right.  The tank on the right was a bleach tank (sodium hypochlorite).  The driver pumped the acid from his truck into the bleach tank causing an off gas of chlorine gas.  The gas was sucked into the neighboring building by an air intake that was located approximately 10ft from the tanks.  A strong odor was noticed in the neighboring building around 5pm.  At this time the building was evacuated and 911 was called.   Tofte FD was onsite at 5:17pm.  Tank was done off gasing.  Full fire crew was onsite at approximately 5:45pm and the building was reoccupied and aired out.    A person was transported by ambulance to the hospital in Grand Marais, MN due to exhibiting possible signs of a chlorine exposure.  The persons actual health and whether they were admitted is unknown.   Fire left around 6:30pm.  Tank was pumped out and system purged with the aid of another employee.

While the fuel was being pumped into the underground storage tank either due to driver error or pump failure there was 700 gallons of Diesel fuel spilled onto the surface.  The surface was an asphalt parking lot and the fuel followed the surface drainage and pooled in the depressions in the parking lot.  Local First responders covered the spilled area with sand to contain the spill and control the vapors. Lincoln environmental Services was called to the scene to effect the cleanup.  They swept up the contaminated sand from the concrete surface around the fuel island.  Additional absorbent was placed on any remaining fuel stains.
