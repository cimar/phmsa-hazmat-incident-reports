DURING THE COURSE OF TRANSPORTATION, THE DRIVER STOPPED TO CONDUCT A ROUTINE TIRE AND LOAD CHECK AND NOTICED THAT A SMALL LEAK DEVELOPED AT THE REAR DOOR OF THE ROLL-OFF CAN.  AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTION, THE DRIVER OBSERVED A SMALL AMOUNT OF CLEAR LIQUID DRIPPING FROM THE REAR DOOR.  HE IMMEDIATELY PLACED A SHEET OF POLY UNDER THE DOOR TO COLLECT THE MATERIAL ESCAPING FROM THE PACKAGE.  IN ADDITION, HE USED AN ABSORBENT MATERIAL TO FURTHER CONTROL THE RELEASE OF THE MATERIAL.  THE DRIVER THEN CONTACTED FLEET'S SOUTH BOSTON SERVICE CENTER WHO, IN TURN, DISPATCHED NEEDED SUPPLIES & MANPOWER TO STOP THE LEAK, RE-SEAL THE REAR DOOR AND CLEAN-UP ALL MATERIAL RELEASED FROM THE CONTAINER.  UPON ARRIVING AT THE SITE, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT MOISTURE TRAPPED IN THE SOIL FORMED SMALL PUDDLES ON THE TOP OF THE LOAD, WHICH CAUSED FROM THE VIBRATION OF THE VEHICLE AS IT WAS IN MOTION THEREBY CAUSING THE MOISTURE TO SEPARATE FROM THE SOIL.  THE RESPONSE CREW ABSORBED ALL FREE LIQUID WITH SPEEDI DRI, APPLIED A BEAD OF SILICONE GREASE TO THE REAR SEAL TO PREVENT ANY RESIDUAL MOISTURE FROM ESCAPING AND RE-SEALED THE CONTAINER.  IN ADDITION, ALL ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND SPILL DEBRIS WERE PLACED IN THE ROLL-OFF CAN AND WERE DISPOSED OF AT THE INTENDED WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITY.  IN ORDER TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE, A SUITABLE LINER WILL BE USED FOR ANY SHIPMENT CONTAINING SOIL.  IN ADDITION, THE REAR SEAL WILL BE INSPECTED FOR DEFECTS AND REPLACED IF NEEDED.

THE TANK CAR WAS LOADED WITH SODIUM HYDROXIDE SOLUTION AND IT WAS SOLIDIFYING AS IT LEAKED OUT OF THE TANK AND COOLED. THE MAXIMUM DAILY LOSS CALCULATED ON A WARM DAY WAS LESS THAN ONE HALF GALLON PER 24 HOUR PERIOD, COOLER DAYS WOULD HAVE LESS LEAKAGE. THE TANK CAR ARRIVED AT THE SNOWFLAKE MILL THE EVENING OF 03/15/2002. THE APACHE RR DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR BEFORE THEY TOOK CONTROL OF IT IN HOLBROOK PRIOR TO TRANSPORTING IT TO THE MILL. THE MILL WENT DOWN ON 03/22/2002 FOR AN OUTAGE AND DID NOT RESTART UNTIL 04/01/2002. THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE OPERATOR WENT TO CONNECT TO THE TANK AND TRANSFER THE CONTENTS. THE TEMPORARY STORAGE SIDING WAS CHECKED AND THREE SMALL SPOTS WERE FOUND WHERE THE CAR MAY HAVE LEAKED. WOOD CHIPS AND THE TRACK BALLAST WERE REMOVED FROM THESE THREE SPOTS AND THE UNDERLYING SOIL PH CHECKED. THE PH OF ALL THREE SAMPLES WAS LESS THAN 7.5 INDICATING NO CONTAMINATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT. EMPTYING WAS COMPLETED EMPTY AT 1500 HOURS ON 04/19/2002 BASED ON AVAILABLE VOLUME IN THE ON-SITE CAUSTIC TANK. IT WAS DISCONNECTED AND WASHED WHILE STILL IN THE CEMENT LINED UNLOADING AREA. THE CAR WAS MOVED AND STORED TEMPORARILY UNTIL DIRECTIONS WERE RECEIVED FROM DOW THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ANY LEAK AFTER THE CAR WAS UNLOADED AND WASHED. DOW DIRECTED THE MILL TO RETURN THE CAR TO THEIR FACILITY FOR INSPECTION AND REPAIRS. THE CAR WAS MOVED TO THE APACHE RAILWAY REPAIR SHOP ON 04/29/2002 TO BE PREPARED FOR SHIPMENT BACK TO DOW'S REPAIR FACILITY. THE APACHE RAILWAY HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH DOW FOR PROPER SHIPPING REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE TANK CAR IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE DAMAGE OR THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK THIS INFORMATION WILL HAVE TO COME FROM THE DOW REPAIR FACILITY.

THE REPORT CAME IN THAT WHILE OFFLOADING THE LOWER BELLY COMPARTMENTS THERE WAS AN ODOR OF GASOLINE. PART TIME SPILL TECHNICIANS BETH PARKER AND DONNIE OSBORNE DONNED THEIR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND ENTERED THE LOWER BELLY COMPARTMENTS 1 AND 2 USING A PHOTO IONIZING DETECTOR TO DETERMINE WHICH PACKAGE OR PARCEL WAS EMITTING THE ODOR.   AFTER GOING THROUGH THEY FOUND A MANILLA PAPER TYPE PARCEL ENVELOPE THAT APPEARED TO HAVE A STAIN ON THE OUTSIDE AND THE DETECTOR INDICATED THAT THIS WAS THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR.  PART TIME SPILL TECHNICIAN BETH PARKER OPENED THE ENVELOPE AND DISCOVERED ANOTHER LIKE ENVELOPE INSIDE AND OPENED IT DISCOVERING 2 WHITE PLASTIC CONTAINERS. FURTHER INSPECTION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS IN ONE OF THE PLASTIC CONTAINERS AN OIL SAMPLE WITH APPROXIMATELY 4 OUNCES (120 MLS) WHICH DID NOT LEAK.  TECHNICIAN PARKER THEN OPEN THE SECOND PLASTIC CONTAINER AND FOUND THE SOURCE OF THE ODOR AND THAT IT HAD LEAKED.  ALSO FOUND INSIDE WAS A CTC ANALYTICAL OIL SERVICES SAMPLE INFORMATION FORM THAT INDICATED THAT THE GASOLINE SAMPLE WAS TO BE TESTED FOR ""SUGAR"" FROM A GASOLINE TANK OF A 92 PLYMOUTH VOYAGER.  THE PART TIME SPILL TECHNICIANS PLACED THE PARCEL IN 2 PLASTIC BAGS WITH AN ABSORBENT PAD AND RETURNED TO THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SORT FACILITY.  THE PARCEL IN QUESTION WAS THEN PLACED INTO A UN SPECIFICATION SALVAGE DRUM AND THE SHIPMENT WAS PLACED UNDER LOCK AND KEY PENDING FAA INVESTIGATION IN THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL SORT SECURITY CAGE.

DELIVERY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WAS BEING MADE TO MID KANSAS COOP (MKC) STORAGE FACILITY AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 AM.  HOSE CONNECTIONS WERE ALL MADE FROM TRANSPORT TO STORAGE AND AS DELIVERY DRIVER OPENED THE LIQUID VALVE A BLEEDER HOSE RELEASED A CLOUD OF VAPORIZED AMMONIA INTO THE AIR.  THIS CLOUD WAS IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE VALVES FOR BOTH TRANSPORT AND STORAGE MAKING IT UNSAFE TO CLOSE VALVES WITHOUT EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT IT WAS UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT WAS CAUSING THE RELEASE AND WHAT (IF ANYTHING) HAD FAILED.  911 WERE CALLED AND THE LOCAL BUHLER FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS NOTIFIED.  THEY RESPONDED WITH EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL USING WATER FOG AND BREATHING EQUIPMENT TO CLOSE VALVES AND SHUT OFF RELEASE.  AFTER THE RELEASE WAS SHUT OFF IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO EQUIPMENT FAILURE.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE VALVE ON THE HOSE USED TO BLEED THE TRANSPORT CONNECTION INTO A WATER TANK HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY EITHER A) THE PREVIOUS DELIVERY AND NOT CLOSING THE VALVE OR B) SOME PERSON THAT WAS ATTEMPTING TO STEAL NH3 FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING METHAMPHETAMINE.  WE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS THE LAST THING, BECAUSE THE HOSE WAS SECURED INTO THE WATER TANK PRIOR TO THIS SO THIS VERY THING WOULD NOT HAPPEN WHEN THE CONNECTION PRESSURE WAS RELEASED.
