At Mile 46.88, approximately 18 miles into their trip, the 16th car in the train, GATX 19088 Diesel Fuel, experienced a burned off journal on the 2nd wheel set on the north end of the car.  At Mile 48.70 the burnt off journal wheel set kinked out from under the car allowing the side frame to drop.  When the side frames shifted, the remaining wheel set contacted the center sill of the car causing a slow friction burn through on the remaining axle.  The train stopped at Mile 52.25 and nosed in the passing siding at South Lagrange to lift several loads for the chipper.  After lifting the loads on their nose they backed out of the siding and continued north another 1.2 miles where they stopped again.  They shoved the loads, which were on their nose, into the south end of the chip loading track at Mile 53.47, South Lagrange.  They backed out of the chip siding after dropping the chip loads and continued their trip north.  When the 16th car in the train encountered the facing point switch at Mile 53.47 whe remaining axle burnt (broke) through and derailed GATX 19088.  GATX 19088 rolled to the east side of the track striking (cornering) one of the loaded chip cars they had previously set on the chip siding.  The impact slightly damaged a vent located on the top of the tank car.  A very small amount of disel fuel dripped from the vent apparently caused by the impact (stress) of striking the equipment on the adjacent track.  The dripping product was contained by use of a bucket.  The small amount which actually dripped on the ground prior to placement of the container was cleaned up by use of pads.",,Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,0,"Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway",US,

During which time we have received several loads of phenol in truck load quantities, using air pressure to unload it. We have been using the same technique to unload phenol from railcars since August 2005.      On December 1, 2005 we were attempting to unload phenol from railcar #GATX2829 into our phenol stroage tank. When the flow failed to start we presumed the line was plugged and opened the vent valve until the pressure gauge on the railcar indicated zero; we later discovered it actually had close to 18 psi. We disconnected the fill hose and noticed the phenol in the short (approximately two feet long) piece of pipe leading to the railcar was plugged solid with frozen phenol. We then used a steam lance, blowing hot steam onto the outside of the pipe. Since phenol thaws at 105 F, when it was warmed up, phenol came out of that piece of pipe with the force provided by the air pressure inside the railcar. We quickly fabricated something like a ""Shepard's hook"", and shut off the phenol flow by closing the valve from the railcar. The total time of flow was probably around five minutes with the volume around 375 gallons. There were no injuries associated with the release.","We are going to have more ""chemical specific"" training on the safe handling and unloading of phenol. Additionally, we will heat trace the fill and vent lines preventing the freezing conditions that plugged the lines leading to this incident. Our procedures now include checking the railcar pressure by slowly loosening the bolts on the manhole cover to ensure there is no pressure.",Yes,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,1800,"Paneltech International, LLC",US,

Driver went to the cab of the truck and sat in seat to do paperwork and at some point looked into the mirror and noticed product spewing from top of recieving tank.  Driver immediately closed the external valves on the trailer and the load line.  The driver then called the carrier to report the incident.  The drain valve for the containment had been left open and approximately 85 gallons of HCL was released to the land.  A clean-up company was sent to the scene and product on the ground was neutralized and standing liquid in the containment area was vaccumed up.

The drum was unloaded from the inbound trailer and reloaded onto an outbound trailer (078) with other containers on 12/23/05.  Trailer 078 was only partially loaded and remained parked at the loading dock (ramped area with secondary containment and blind sump) until 12/26/05.  On 12/26/05, at approximately 18:30, an employee of the transfer facility noticed material on the floor of trailer 078.  The spill was investigated and the leaking drum was identified shortly thereafter.  Clean-up procedures were initiated immediately by on-site personnel.  All spillage was contained in secondary containement.  The spilled material was solidified with oil dry and placed into DOT approved containers (two 30 gallon containers) and placed on a pallet with the now empty original container, for shipment to the final disposal facility.    The container that leaked was inspected and a small hole (approximately 2-3mm)was found on the side of the drum approximately one inch above the bottom of the drum.  The hole appeared to be the result of corrosion from inside the container.  It did not appear to be a puncture hole.","The exterior of the drum appeared to be in very good shape.

When doors to trailer were openned a leak was discovered coming from a 55 gal drum located at the rear of the trailer. It was determined that the drum contained a poison. The trailer was moved to an isolated area in the yard. The Jacksonville fire and rescue hazmat unit was contacted. They determined a punture 1 to 2 inches in length about a 1/3 up from the bottom of the drum was the source of the leak. They sealed the leak. A environmental recovery contractor removed the drum from the trailer and placed it in a recovery drum. They then cleaned up the spill and neutralized the area.The material was disposed of by a licensed environmental recovery company.,A safety meeting was held with the dock workers who loaded the drum on the trailer. It consisted of the proper procedures for loading and unloading hazardous materials with an emphasis on 55 gallon drums.

Van was not wide enough to accomidate palatized shipment.  Drums were removed from pallets and stood free standing in the trailer.  A load lock was installed in front of and behind drums.  While inroute driver had to brake hard and some drums shifted forward causing the front load lock to giveway. Drums continued forward contacting the bulk head of the trailer causing it to giveway and break loose from the front of the trailer.  Three drums went outside the trailer and rolled into the ditch but did not leak. Two drums wedged between the front of the trailer and the back of the tractor.  One drum punctured on the bottom and leaked out most of the material.  The second drum was punctured at the top and leaked two or three gallons.  The driver who is a volunteer fireman recognized the hazard and borrowed a shovel from passer by and formed a containment around the leak. The driver called his dispatcher and I was called. Upon notice I looked up the number and called the Williamsburg County of South Carolina Sheriff department and notified them of the incident.  My next call was to EMI a national emergancy responce angency to arrange a team for clean up and remediantion.  A team was dispacted from Charleston, SC and a wrecker service from near by was contacted to assist.  The drums were removed from the ditch and reloaded the leaking drum was put into an overpack container and reloaded.  The shipment was escorted about 10 miles to the consignee and off loaded in their receiving area.  The EMI team continued with the sight clean up the following day and an estimated 4 yards of soil were replaced and the EMI team took the contaiminated soil for proper disposal.  Temporary repairs were made to the trailer and it was tranported to a vendor for repair.",Going forward dispatch rules have been modified to ensure proper dispatch equipment sized for shipment configuration.  Also loading proceedures have been reviewed to ensure proper securement of all free standing cargo.,No,DRUM,"Drum - fiber, metal or plastic not specified",DRUM,No,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,15900,"Howard Sheppard, Inc",US,

The driver immediately reported the incident to our traffic manager and at the same time stopped refueling and moved the truck to an isolated area within the truck stop. The driver used his spill response materials to capture and control furhter drips. Roughly an hour after noticing the dripping, our driver reported that the dripping had stopped.     The operator of the truck stop was notified of the situation, as was the Indiana Department of Environmental Managemment(IDEM)at(317)308-3377. The IDEM contact was Mr. Jason Sewell, who assigned the incident the case number ""2005-12-108.""    Private emergency response contractors were dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, our driver shared the shipping papers with the contractor and together they determined the most likely source for the release. Using the appropriate monitoring devices, the response contractor confirmed that the trailer was safe for entry of his crew to identify and control the leaking container. After re-positioning a number of containers (55 gallon drums) the offending container was located, identified, and overpacked for safe transport for appropriate disposal.     The container was determined to have leaked as the result of a pin-hole in the base of the container. The actual cause of the pin-hole is not yet known. The remaining iquid in the container was measured and it was determined that the maximum volume that could have been release was 10 gallons.     The material released consisted of a mixture of alcohol and xylene. No deterioration of the asphalt or other property was noticed.","The specific reason for the pin-hole release has yet to be answered conclusively. No evidence was found that would indicate the cause for the leak. No physical ""trauma"" to the container could be found. However, the container supplier has been contacted and steps are being taken to try and determine the cause for the leak and to prevent future similar incidents.

Packerland Dr.,Green Bay,WI,54306,Carrier,"Driver was transferring product from cargo tank to customer storage tank using a pump.  When customer tank was registering 80% full, it started to foam over.  Driver was standing by the customer valve at the time so he shut that valve to prevent more product from entering the tank.  As he went to shut trailer valve and the fitting blew off the fill line hook-up and product splashed out.  Driver was splashed in eyes.  He was immediately taken to a water hose to flush his eyes and then to an eyewash station to flush for 15 minutes.  He was checked out by an onsite nurse who sent him to the hospital to be checked out.  In the meantime, I talked to a toxicologist from the shipper and they said as long as the driver got his eyes washed out as directed, he should be okay.  The hospital checked out the driver and released him back to the mill to complete the delivery.",An unstable fill line with a little extra pressure on it may have caused the problem but the main issue is that the driver was not wearing the proper PPE prescribed.

HE WAS IN TRANSIT BETWEEN CARTHAGE, NC AND ROBBINS, NC TRAVELING ON PLANK ROAD. IT WAS RAINING AT THE TIME.

AS THE VEHICLE OVERTURNED, THE DELIVERY HOSE REEL STRUCK THE ROADWAY SURFACE CAUSING A VERY SMALL CRACK TO FORM IN A 1/4 "" SCHEDULE 80 ELBOW AT THE PIPE THREADS. THIS SMALL ELBOW IS USED IN CONNECTING A HYDROSTATIC RELIEF VALVE TO THE DELIVERY HOSE. THE VEHICLE ROLLED OVER 1.5 TIMES AND SLID DOWN THE ROAD FOR APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET.   ONLY THE PRODUCT IN THE DELIVERY HOSE WAS LOST, ABOUT 5 GALLONS OF PROPANE, DUE TO VALVES THAT ISOLATED THE DELIVERY HOSE FROM THE REST OF THE PIPING SYSTEM ON THE VEHICLE. THE RELEASE LASTED 3.5 HOURS. THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RELEASE LASTED WAS DUE TO THE VERY SMALL SIZE OF THE CRACK IN THE PIPING. DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THE LEAK AND PROPANE'S PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, NOTHING WAS DONE TO MITIGATE THE LEAK OTHER THAN MAKING SURE THE VALVE TO THE HOSE REEL WAS CLOSED.

The driver pulled over and inspected the load and observed one of four drums shrink-wrapped on a pallet to be leaning onto the side of the trailer. Paint had leaked from a hole in the bottom of the drum.  The drum appeared to have been punctured by the corner of the pallet or a nail in the pallet. An estimated 5 gallons of paint had leaked onto the floor of the trailer with an estimated 2 gallons leaking from the trailer onto the asphalt roadway and adjacent shoulder.  An emergency response crew arrived onsite at approximately 1900 CST, donned Level ""C"" PPE and entered the trailer.  ER personnel overpacked the leaking drum and cleaned the paint from the floor of the trailer. Absorbent clay was placed on the asphalt to absorb the paint.

The driver pulled over to the side of the road and called the facility for further instructions. PSC employees called 911 and checked the waste profile and informed the dispatcher and transportation group that there may be batteries in the box and to use fire fighting foam to fight the fire.     Approximately 2:02 PM:   The driver pulled into the facility a couple of minutes later, and the rear roll off box had smoke coming out of it. Employees got the facility's foam cannon set up while the box was moved onto the west pad (into secondary containment) to be able to contain any potential run off or overflow.     Approximately 2:20 PM:  The driver opened up the lid of the box just as the fire department showed up. When the air hit the material in the box the fire flared up, PSC employees turned on the foam cannon and began the fire suppression. The fire department then came over and took over the operation of the foam cannon. The cannon was moved a little closer to the box for better coverage, and after several minutes the fire was put out.     Approximately 2:50PM:  The fire department continued shooting foam into the roll off until it was full. They then informed PSC to wait to drain the box to ensure everything was out and the material had cooled down. After the fire was out and the box had been filled with foam.    Approximately 3:15 PM:  Deputy Fire Marshal Lee Britt, stated that he was going to report this as a dumpster fire and thanked PSC for good decision-making and assistance.","The following background information was provided by a representative from the generator of the roll-off box in question, Mercer Distribution Services (a warehouse and distribution company located in Auburn, Washington):    -In August 2005, Mercer had a fire at their facility that was believed to have been caused by nickel-cadmium batteries that came into contact with various building materials while being offloaded from a transport trailer.    -Mercer contracted with Western States Environmental to provide cleanup services following the fire, and they placed the cleanup debris into the roll-off box in question.  The generator thought it was possible that the contractor may have placed live nickel-cadmium batteries into the box containing the cleanup debris.      After the roll-off box fire had been completely extinguished, PSC personnel inspected the contents of the box and noticed that several batteries were commingled with debris in the location where the fire appeared to have started.      A second roll-off box was also included in the shipment, but it was not involved in the fire.  The contents of this box were inspected, but no batteries could be seen.  The box appears to contain only charred building materials from the cleanup of the August fire, matching PSC’s approved waste profile for the shipment.    As PSC was acting only as the transporter at the time of the incident, we have communicated our concerns to the generator regarding this incident.  Specifically, the generator has been advised that materials placed into roll-off boxes must be carefully sorted to insure incompatible or non-conforming materials are not commingled.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Burlington Environmental Inc.,US,

Brodd was driving an Apria 2001 Isuzu, FRR, box truck, NE license 48-1246. He was traveling east bound at approximately 25 MPH and when he tried to maneuver the truck to the center of the roadway as he approached a one lane wide bridge he lost control of the vehicle in the mud. The truck impacted the side of the bridge at approximately the middle, road side of the vehicle at the side door.    The impact caved in the side of the vehicle at the side, roll up, door and intruded into the cargo area. The impact severed the plumbing and control valves on the fill/discharge line. As a result of the plumbing being severed from the non-specification cargo tank approximately 150 liquid gallons of Oxygen, refrigerated liquid was released onto the ground.    Brodd contacted his office, McCook, NE. via radio and they contacted the Decatur County (KS) Sheriffs Office.    Upon the responding officers arrival it was found that the cargo tank had emptied and the spill had vaporized and dissipated.
