BAY WEST DISPATCHED FOUR RESPONSE PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT TO ASSESS THE SITUATION, CONTAINERIZE THE LEAKING DRUM, AND COLLECT AND CONTAINERIZE THE SPILLED MATERIAL.  UPON ARRIVAL, BAY WEST MET WITH MR ULEY SEAL, MINN FIRE DEPT, MR KEVIN FAUS AND MR MARK OEMICHEN, BOTH OF MINN POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY (MCPA), MR PETE MARCOTTE, MINN DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION (MN/DOT), AND MR ROGER VAN TASSEL, CITY OF MINN, AND ASSESSED THE SITUATION.  IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT APPX 50 GALLONS OF HYDROFLUORIC ACID WAS SPILLED FROM A 55 GAL CONTAINER. ************** BAY WEST DONNED LEVEL B PERSONNEL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) TO CONDUCT AIR MONITORING IN THE SUBJECT TRAILER.  DRAGER TUBES, WHICH INDICATE LEVELS OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND HYDROFLUORIC ACID, WERE USED TO DETERMINE POSSIBLE EXPOSURE LEVELS.  BAY WEST FOUND 3 PARTS PER MILLION (PPM) OF HYDROFLUORIC ACID AND 4 PPM OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID.  A DRAGER TUBE FOR AMMONIA WAS USED AND NO AMMONIA WAS FOUND IN THE TRAILER.  DURING THE ASSESSMENT, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ONE DRUM AT THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER WAS DAMAGED AND EMPTY.  A POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION COULD NOT BE MADE AS TO WHAT WAS SPILLED FROM THE DRUM DUE TO THE POSITION OF THE CONTAINER.  ***************** BAY WEST UNLOADED THE TRAILER IN THE DUFOUR SALES WAREHOUSE AND DETERMINED THE DRUM CONTAINED HYDROFLUORIC ACID.  THE DAMAGED DRUM WAS OVER-PACKED INTO A DOT APPROVED POLYETHYLENE CONTAINER AND LABELED.  USING SODA ASH TO NEUTRALIZE THE SPILLED MATERIAL, BAY WEST BEGAN TO RECOVER AS MUCH OF THE SPILLED MATERIAL AS POSSIBLE.  APPX ONE QUART OF FREE LIQUID REMAINED IN THE TRAILER UNDER THE FLOORING.  CONTAMINATED PALLETS AND DEBRIS WERE CUT INTO PIECES AND PLACED INTO POLYETHYLENE DRUMS FOR DISPOSAL.  THE TRAILER BED WAS DAMAGED BY THE HYDROFLUORIC ACID.  USING A NEUTRALIZING SOLUTION, BAY WEST WASHED THE TRUCK BED AND THE DOCK AREA.  ADDITIONAL SODA ASH WAS PLACED ON THE TRUCK BED FLOOR TO NEUTRALIZE ANY HYDROFLUORIC ACID THAT MAY HAVE BEEN REACTING WITH THE TRUCK BED INSULATION.  ********************* BAY WEST RETURNED TO THE SITE ON 1/31/97 TO PREPARE THE DRUMS FOR DISPOSAL.  ONE DRUM WAS FOUND TO BE EXPANDING, AND BAY WEST RELIEVED THE PRESSURE WITH A REMOTE DRUM PUNCH.  ADDITIONAL SODA ASH WAS ADDED TO THE MATERIAL BEFORE REPACKAGING.  NINE DRUMS OF CONTAMINATED MATERIALS WERE GENERATED DURING THE SPILL RESPONSE.  BAY WEST AND OLIN CORP COORDINATED THE DISPOSAL OF THE WASTE.  ALL DISPOSAL RECORDS WILL BE SUBMITTED TO OLIN CORP UPON RECEPIT.  BAY WEST RECOMMENDS THAT A COPY OF THIS REPORT BE SUBMITTED TO THE REGULATING AUTHORITIES THAT RESPONDED TO THE SCENE.

APPROXIMATELY 1/4 MILE WEST OF THE HWY 60 & INTERSTATE 64 INTERCHANGE. THE RELEASE OCCURRED WHILE NEWCOMB OIL CO.

THE DRIVER CLOSED THE TRANSPORT TANK'S VALVE WHICH SUPPLIED THE DELIVERY HOSE UPON NOTICING THE PROBLEM, BUT A DELAY OCCURRED BETWEEN THE TIME THAT THE SPILL STARTED AND THE TIME THAT THE SPILL WAS NOTICED. THIS DELAY (OF AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIME) ATTRIBUTED TO THE LARGE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT BEING RELEASED. THE SPILLED PRODUCT FLOWED DIRECTLY DOWN-GRADIENT FROM THE SPILL POINT, ACROSS THE DIRVEWAY AND TOWARD A STORM WATER DRAIN (SEE FIGURE 1 AND ATTACHMENT A). THE DRIVER QUICKLY APPLIED ALL OF THE ABSORBENT PADS THAT WERE CARRIED ON HIS TRUCK TO THE SPILL. THE DRIVER THEN ALERTED THE STORE'S MANAGER TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE MANAGER AND DRIVER APPLIED ALL OF THE ABSORBENT MATERIAL (OIL-DRY) FROM THE STORE TO THE SPILL. ADDITIONAL ABSORBENT MATERIALS WERE OBTAINED  FROM ANOTHER NEWCOMB OIL CO.

THE KY NATURAL RESOURCES EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER AND THE NATIONAL SPILL RESPONSE CENTER WERE NOTIFIED BETWEEN 1:00 P.M. AND 1:15 P.M. ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 10, 1997. THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT THAT WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN SPILLED AT THAT TIME WAS 25-30 GALLONS. (UPON ARRIVAL ON THE SCENE AND SURVEY OF THE SPILL AREA, THE AMOUNT WAS UPDATED TO APPROXIMATELY 100 GALLONS.

THE DRIVER RETURNED TO HIS TRUCK AT APPX 15:30 PM AND PERFORMED THE USUAL WALK-AROUND INSPECTION AND TIRE CHECK REQUIRED BY DOT.  DURING THE WALK-AROUND INSPECTION, THE DRIVER NOTICED AN UNUSUAL ODOR COMING FROM THE TRAILER.  HE INSPECTED THE TRAILER AND NOTICED SOME SMALL DROPLETS DRIPPING OUT OF THE TRUCK INTO THE ASPHALT.  AT THIS TIME HE CALLED HIS DISPATCHER - STEVE MOONEY AND ADVISED HIM OF THE INCIDENT.  STEVE THEN CALLED ADVANCED ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNICAL SERVICES AND SPOKE TO MATT MORRIS WHO DISPATCHED A CREW TO RESPOND TO STABILIZE THE SCENE AND CLEAN ANY SPILLED MATERIAL.  THE RESPONDING TEAM ARRIVED AT APPX 21:00 PM ON THE 22ND.  IT WAS FOUND THAT APPX 2.5 GALS OF 49% HYDROFLUORIC ACID HAD LEAKED FROM A LAB PACK CONTAINER.

AS THE CONTAINER WAS A PLACARDED COMMODITY, IT WAS MOVED TO TRAILER STORAGE LOT #16 AND ISOLATED PENDING INSPECTION.  CONTAINER TRLU 482435, ARRIVED LOS ANGELES ON THE CHLA6X-18, AT 0550 HRS, TUE, 1/21/97.  MGR COOPER DROVE TO THE INTERMODAL FACILITY AND OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A PINK COLORED PAINT MATERIAL LEAKING THROUGH THE FLOORING, NEAR THE FORWARD PORTION OF THE CONTAINER, DIRECTLY BEHIND THE CHASSIS LANDING GEAR.  SEAL XXXX XXXXXXX WAS REMOVED, AND THE REAR DOORS OPENED TO INSPECT THE LADING.  A TOYOTA CAMRY WAS LOCATED IN THE REAR HALF OF THE CONTAINER, WITH THE MIXED FREIGHT AND HAZ MAT LOCATED IN THE FORWARD PORTION OF THE CONTAINER. UPON REACHING THE FORWARD SECTION OF THE CONTAINER, OBSERVED A MAKE SHIFT BRACE MADE OF 2X4'S AND 4X4'S, ALL OF WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY 2 EACH, 12 FOOT 2X4'S THAT WERE NAILED TO THE BRACE AT THE CENTER, AND RAN THE LENGTH OF THE CONTAINER, DOWN THE SIDE OF THE AUTOMOBILE, WHERE IT WAS NAILED TO THE FLOORING.  THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE FOR SECURING FREIGHT, NOR IS IT AN APPROVED METHOD FOR THE BLOCKING AND BRACING OF HAZ MAT, PER BUREAU OF EXPLOSIVES PAMPHLET 6C. ************************  4 EACH, 30 GALLON METAL DRUMS, WERE OBSERVED LOADED ON THE FLOOR DIRECTLY BEHIND THE BRACING.  THEY HAD BEEN PLACED IN A 4X4X4 PATTERN ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE CONTAINER, WHICH LEFT VERY LARGE VOIDS BETWEEN THE DRUMS AND THE SIDES OF THE CONTAINER.  THE FLOORING WAS COVERED WITH THE PAINT MATERIAL WHERE THE DRUMS WERE SITTING.  PALLETS OF ADDITIONAL PAINT MATERIAL IN 10 GALLON METAL PAILS HAD BEEN PLACED ON TOP OF THE METAL DRUMS WITH NO BI-LEVEL SEPARATION, AND THERE WAS ADDITIONAL FREIGHT MIXED IN WITH THE HAZ MAT. THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE AND DOES NOT MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMODITY SEGREGATION AND BI-LEVEL SEPARATION FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF HAZ MAT PER BOE 6C.  **************** AS THERE WAS NO SECUREMENT OF THE METAL DRUMS, THEY MOVED DURING TRANSIT, WHICH ALLOWED FOR ADDITIONAL VOIDS, RESULTING IN THE UPPER LEVEL PALLETS TOPPLING OFF OF THE DRUMS. ALSO, DUE TO THE WEIGHT OF THE PAINT MATERIAL IN THE PAILS, AND NO BI-LEVEL SEPARATION, 2 OF THE DRUMS WERE CRUSHED AND FAILED AT THE BOTTOM ROLLING HOOP FROM THE DRUM COLLASPING.  1 PAIL FAILED FROM TOPPLING FROM THE PALLET AND ABRASION FROM ADJACENT FREIGHT.  APPX 1 GALLON OF LIQUID WAS LOST FROM THE PAIL, AND IT WAS ABSORBED INTO THE ADJACENT FREIGHT. BOTH OF THE DRUMS LOST APPX 7-10 GALLONS EACH.
