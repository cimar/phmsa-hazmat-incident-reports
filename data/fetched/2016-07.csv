The car was isolated and the shipper, Omnitrax Logistics, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report 2016-07-02-00083).  Summit Environmental, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene. Prior to Summits arrival, a local CSX manager inspected the car and found the vapor line valve was not fully closed- at this time he closed the valve and stopped the release.  Upon Summits arrival they discovered that the secondary securement plug on the vapor line was not installed; Summit also discovered the secondary securement plug on the sample line was not installed.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative (Dax Eymard 956-592-4216).  Summit ensured all other closure valves were closed and secondary securement plugs installed wrench tight.  The car was released for transportation.  No Special switching move was required.

CSX crews detected an odor of ammonia coming from the area of this car.  Local fire department was contacted and responded, United States Environmental Services (CSX Hazmat Contractor), and Hazmat Manager Trent Page responded.  The local fire department confirmed that the car was leaking.  USES and H/M Trent Page arrived onsite.  H/M Trent Page notified the shipper, Trammo (Dori Hester) and requested a local shipper contact.  Trammo, Dori Hester, provided Alan Bees with Trammo.  Alan responded to assist.    The shippers employee and USES confirmed the following: liquid line valve (B end) partially open, liquid line plug (B end) less than tool tight and unsecured, sample line plug less than tool tight/ unsecured, and the thermometer well cap unsecured.  The liquid line was closed and all plugs were secured.    A secondary inspection revealed that there was a constant leak coming from the pressure plate that was unable to be secured.  Hazmat Manager Trent Page contacted FRA inspector Gene Booker and Hazmat Director Mike Austin contacted FRA Kevin Blackwell and requested emergency permission to move this car for offloading in the interest of public safety back to the shipper facility in Pascagoula located approximately less than 2 miles by rail away.  Permission verbally granted by both.  Local fire and EMA director along with Mississippi State DEQ hazmat agreed to move the car in the interest of public safety.    Car was returned to shipper in Pascagoula for offloading.  Note:  The waybill reflects Trammo as the shipper with a Sutton, FL address.  The actual pickup location is at MISSISSIPPI PHOSPHATES CORP, 601 INDUSTRIAL RD, PASCAGOULA, MS 39567.  The CSX mainline was shut down for approximately 6 hours during this incident.

The car mover began backing the 3 cars down the spur when it was discovered the rail car breaking system was not pressurized.  The rail car mover brakes were applied but this had no effect on the speed.  The cars and the car mover traveled approximately 3,400 feet when they were derailed by the fix track de-railer located before the Union Pacific mainline.  The three cars rolled and one car was leaking from the top fill valve which was now positioned on the side (3 O'clock).  Univar personnel were able to stop the leak by driving a wooden spike into the valve body.  Emergency response contractors were hired to transfer the remaining product to an empty rail car last containing the same material.  The released material was contained by diking the area and covering the ground with plastic.  The soil was removed with heavy equipment and placed in roll off containers for disposal. The 2 rail cars that did not leak were evacuated in the same fashion.","The training requirements and operator qualifications for performing rail car movements are under review.

While at his second stop, the RTS driver noticed liquid on the floor of his truck. There was a container with a slow leak.The Driver had stopped at Gage, his first LTL stop, and picked up 9 five gallon pails and 16 55-SL drums. At the time of the Gage pickup he was suspicious of one container's integrity. When the driver got to his next stop he noticed liquid on the truck floor. The Gage product codes' are 32015 - 2 steel drums; 32101 7 steel drums/32103 7 steel drums; 32011 - 8 five gallon pails; 32014 -1 five gallon pail.Logistics arranged for an outside company to meet the driver in an isolated parking area. The driver and outside contractor over packed the leaking container, placed absorbent down in the truck and cleaned up. No material left the truck. A bottom seam on the drum appeared to have failed. The cause appeared to have been too much pressure being applied by the customers drum loader (mechanically squeezes the drums to lift and load).",The shipper was notified about the integrity of the drums.

Local fire department was contacted and responded and United States Environmental Services (CSX Hazmat Contractor) responded. USES confirmed that the bottom outlet valve was in the closed and locked position and was actively leaking from the BOV.  The BOV cap was also less than tool tight.  USES was able to secure the release by tightening the BOV cap and adding multiple fresh gaskets to the BOV cap. The shipper Stolt Nielsen USA Inc (Gabriel Gomez and Richey Austin) were notified. The shipper was requested by CSXT to provide tank trucks for a product transfer.    A product transfer was conducted by USES on 07/24/16 and this car is now a residue.

No soils, drains or waterways had been impacted by the release. The release occurred from an improperly secured fusible cap.  The cap had been replaced earlier in the day and the new one had not been properly secured and tightened.  When the trailer was put under approximately 10 psi of pressure the fusible cap would leak.  An environmental contractor was dispatched to clean the area and re-secure any loose fittings. The environmental contractor cleaned the side of the tank and re-secured the cap.

The car was isolated and personnel kept from the immediate area while BNSF Hazmat responders inspected the car. Upon inspection it was found that 1 of 6 manway bolts were loose and the manway gasket was not properly aligned. This caused the manway gasket to be crushed and no longer able to seal as designed. Only vapor had been released, no liquid release from the residue tank car. The gasket was changed out and a new gasket installed. Responders inspected remaining tank car appliances and found no defects. The car was released for continued transportation to destination. There were no environmental impacts and estimated release volumes are only estimates based upon information received from the field.","Systech Environmental should review post-unloading inspection procedures for tank cars that they handle.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the storage period, it was discovered that a small amount of material had escaped from a pinhole leak that had developed in the container. Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised container into a suitable salvage drum. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the staging area were collected and placed into the salvage drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.","  At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed. Drivers will continue to inspect each container during staging period as well as before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity. IN addition, the shipper has been advised of the situation and have been asked to inspect all container used for the transport of waste materials to insure they meet all required  specifications.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc",US,

The car was moved outside of the building and assessed. It was noted that liquid was leaking from underneath the vapor valve assembly. The BNSF responder used a pipe wrench and was able to tighten the vapor valve slightly, until it hit the liquid valve. It was determined that the vapor valve was not tight enough due to this contact. The contractor arrived and removed the vapor valve assembly. The previous sealant was removed and the threads were cleaned. The liquid valve was slightly loosend to create clearance for the proper tightening of the vapor valve. The contractor applied Teflon tape to the threads and reinstalled the vapor valve. The liquid valve was then retightened tool-tight. The vapor valve was able to be tool-tightened properly and the car was noted as no longer leaking post-repair.    The shipper requested an OTMA for UTLX 208265 to be sent to final destination for offloading.",Shipper must ensure that packaging and valves are properly secured prior to transport to alleviate any future hazardous materials releases. The valves need to be checked and ensured that they are tool-tight and the proper sealant is in place prior to the loading of tank cars at the facility.

The driver was unloading the portable tank and noticed product leaking from a defective fitting on the discharge of the carrier's tractor-mounted pump. The driver turned off the pump which stopped the hazmat release. Estimated duration of the release is 15 minutes. Released hazmat was contained to the Consignee's concrete pad, mitigating the impact of the release.    An ERTS agent inadvertently filed a report that was unauthorized. As primary ERTS Agent for Quality Carriers, I contacted DOT by phone for assistance. The DOT representative assigned to this report advised me to file another DOT 5800 report to replace DOT 5800 Report No. E-2016080253 with Tracking No.674474.

Driver stopped to investigate and noticed the dome open and resting on its toggles.The release stopped when vehicle was parked. In addition, he noticed the released product had frozen onto the sides of the tank. Duration of the release is estimated to be approximately 10 minutes.

At approximately 0745 the truck left the roadway and overturned in the median, spilling 2 tons of EAF Dust in the median.  The driver reported that he thought a tire blew, causing him  to lose control of the vehicle.  The Indiana State Police Officer that reported to the scene of the crash was also an accident investigator.  According to his findings in the Crash Report, he was unable to locate any evidence that a tire had blown.  He also reported there were no environment or vehicle contributing circumstances to the cause of the accident.  We contacted SET Environmental, Chicago, IL to provide the Emergency Response Services for the clean-up and remediation of the accident site.  When the tractor and trailer left the highway, it hit the guardrail, causing the tractor and trailer to rollover and ultimately come to a stop in the median on its side.  Upon impact of the top corner of the trailer with the ground, the roof on the trailer was partially torn off, therefore releasing 2 tons of EAF Dust on the ground.  SET Environmental and Gardner Transport Services, Inc. worked together toward clean-up and remediation and the spill site was secured by 1730 on 7/22/16.","Gardner Transport Services, Inc. holds quarterly (4) Safety Meetings each year.  Every Safety Meeting consists of teaching and reiterating the importance of safety, awareness of surroundings, being alert and well rested, and the absence of distractions while driving a commercial motor vehicle.  We used this incident as a teaching opportunity and provided additional training, specifically for hauling Hazardous Waste at the next quarterly Safety Meeting. Additionally, all drivers are required to complete Hazardous Materials Safety Training, as per the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.  Since it was determined that the accident was not caused by an equipment failure or any environmental factors, we determined that the cause of the crash was human error.
