The van then went to Scynexis site at Kit Creek in Durham NC to pick up two more drums.Upon opening the door the driver noticed a small amount of liquid between the drums. He located the leaking drum and contacted the on site supervisor. There was a small gouge or cut in the very bottom seam on the side of the drum and liquid was dripping from it. The drum was placed in a salvage drum provided on the underside of the trailer and the material was cleaned up donning the proper personal protective equipment and put into the salvage drum.,Upon review all drums will be loaded using a drum dolly or fork lift and drums will not be loaded by any other means while loading trailers.,No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

While traveling, the Hillis Transport vehicle was struck by a third party, which caused the trailer to dislodge from tractor and rollover into roadside ditch.  Trailer contained approximately 7,500 gallons of diesel fuel.  Hillis Transport dispatched a tanker to offload the damaged trailer, and recovered 3,000 gallons of diesel fuel during offload.  The remaining 4,500 gallons of diesel fuel were released to the soil within the roadside ditch.  The Pocahontas Fire Department responded to assess the site, along with the Arkansas Highway Department.  AR Highway Department utilized sand to create berms at both sides of contamination, in an effort to prevent migration.  Smith & Company of Poplar Bluff, Missouri was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Smith & Company used a vaccuum truck to recover the free liquid diesel fuel and water from the impacted ditch, and deployed sorbent boom and pads to secure the site.  Smith & Company worked at the direction of ARDEQ site representative Dean Vanderhoff, and returned on Monday, May 16th, to excavate the impacted soils, and restore site to preexisting condition.  Site was cleared per visual and olfactory observation, and microblaze solution was left on site as a precaution, to prevent residual contamination.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.",Hillis Transport LLC will continue to train and reinforce safe handling procedures and driver safety to all personnel.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,53000,SPILL CENTER INC.,US,

Immediate inspection of PROX 30070 by a BNSF mechanical responder resulted in no liquid or vapor product release noted at that time, although a very slight product odor was present. PROX 30070 was cordoned off in the railyard. Re-inspection of PROX 30070 during daylight hours revealed a vapor hiss emanating from the pressure relief device (PRD) and product odor. A hazardous material response contractor was summoned and these responders confirmed that the 280.5 psig Midland PRD was the product odor and vapor source. The responders replaced the PRD seat and stem O-rings along with the O-ring retainer by 1305 hrs. PDT. 5/06/2011, thus eliminating any further product vapors and associated product odor. The seat O-ring appeared flattened with a groove along the entire circumference of the O-ring which would classify it as a 'compression set' caused failure.

While transferring one container, it was discovered that approximately 6 ounces of material escaped from the bottom of the container. Facility personnel placed the leaking container into a suitable salvage drum along with all clean-up debris from the van trailer. The container was secured and was sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility. All required local and state reports were made that included verbal reports to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and local Fire Department.","At the time the driver accepted the container for transportation, no evidence of leaking was observed. The driver, however, was re-instructed to conduct a  thorough inspection of each container before acceptance and if any evidence of a reduction in structural integrity is found to take appropriate action to  either place the container into a suitable salvage drum or re containerize before transportation is initiated.

The trailer was undergoing routine inspection and container piece count when liquid material was observed on the floor of the trailer and on several wooden pallets.  All containers were removed from the trailer for visual inspection.     The spilled liquid was tested with pH paper and found to be a strong base. It was determined that one 275 gal plastic IBC tote containing caustic liquid was leaking from a seam along the bottom of the container.  It appears the weld seam had cracked and the liquid sloshing motion in the tote during transportation was enough to widen the crack to allow liquid to periodically drip out.    The contents of the leaking tote were transfered to a new clean empty tote.  All spilled liquid in the trailer and pallents adjacent to the leaking tote was cleaned using absorbent material.

The local gas energy service provider was called to investigate whether their gas pipelines were leaking; and no gas line leaks were found. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder and contract responders inspected railcars within the 'odor' zone. Responders reported finding tank car TEIX 33434 as the possible odor source. Further inspection of the valves and fittings under the valve housing cover revealed the base of the A-end liquid valve was frosted over and vapor hissing was audible emanating from this liquid valve's closure plug. The responders removed the frost from the valve's exterior for a detailed inspection. The valve was operated to its full closed position which reduced the audible vapor hiss. The liquid valve's closure plug was tool tightened 1/4 turn which eliminated the vapor hiss and associated odor. No liquid product release was observed. Securement response was concluded by 1310 hrs.

THIS VIOLENT REAR-END COLLISION RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR TRAILER (CONSIDERED A TOTAL LOSS BY ZURICH, NA INSURANCE COMPANY).

THE FUEL HAULER WHO REAR-ENDED US WAS LIFE-FLIGHTED TO THE HOSPITAL, AND THEN RELEASED THE NEXT DAY. OUR DRIVER AND THE PASSENGER VEHICLE DRIVER WERE TRANSPORTED BY AMBULANCE TO A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM. OUR DIRVER WAS RELEASED LATER THE SAME AFTERNOON AFTER EVALUATION AND TREATMENT (WHIPLASH). ALL INJURIES WERE CAUSED BY THE FORCES OF THE COLLISION.    DAMAGE TO THE CARGO TANK TRAILER WAS ALSO CAUSED BY THE FORCE OF THE COLLSION FROM BEHIND.

THE FORCE OF THE COLLISION RIPPED THE DELIVERY PIPING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CARGO TANK. THIS LEFT A HOLE ABOUT 4"" ACROSS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CARGO TANK. THE TANK WAS EMPTY, BUT A SMALL AMOUNT OF RESIDUE FROM THE LAST LOAD REMAINED IN THE TANK (POSSIBLY A GALLON). IT WAS THROWN FORWARD WHEN THE REAR OF THE CARGO TANK WAS HIT AND (ACCORDING TO SOME WITNESSES TOSSED ABOUT 20 FEET INTO THE AIR) AND REMAINED THERE SINCE THE REAR OF THE TRAILER REMAINED ELEVATED EVEN AFTER THE VEHICLES WERE SEPARATED. SOME VAPOR FROM THE RESIDUAL ACID CAME OUT OF THE HOLE BEFORE IT WAS TEMPORARILY PATCHED BY THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS (ADJACENT TO HARRISON COUNTY WHERE THE COLLISION OCCURRED), TOLD ME THAT ANY ACID THAT MIGHT DRIPPED FROM THE HOLE WAS ""VERY MINIMAL."" THE OHIO EPA REPRESENTATIVE ON THE SCENE AGREED THAT THERE WAS ESSENTIALLY NO RELEASE OF LIQUID ACID, JUST THE VAPOR. I UNDERSTAND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS PATCHED THE TANK AND THEN A CLEAN-UP CREW, INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SPECIALIST OF CADIZ, OH (AFFILIATED WITH WESTFALL TOWING), ABSORBED AND CLEANED UP THE LONG TRAIL OF FLUIDS THAT WERE EJECTED FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT OF THE TRACTOR WHICH HIT US (APPROXIMATELY 25 GALLONS THAT MAY HAVE CONTAINED ENGINE COOLAND, OIL, WASHER FLUID, TRANSMISSION FLUID, DIESEL FUEL, POWER STEERING FLUID, ETC.)    ONCE WE WERE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE CARGO TANK AT THE IMPOUND LOT, OUR MECHANICS GEARED UP AND NEUTRALIZED THE REMAINING ACID SOLUTION IN THE FRONT OF THE CARGO TANK WITH SODA ASH. THEN THEY MADE A MORE SECURE PATCH OF THE HOLE IN PREPARATION FOR THE TRAILER","IT PROBABLY IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO BUILD A VEHICLE TO TAKE A FULL-FORCE COLLISION FROM BEHIND WHILE STOPPED AND NOT SUSTAIN SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE. AT SOME POINT THE EXTRA WEIGHT OF THE REINFORCEMENT WOULD SEVERELY LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT WEIGHT THAT COULD BE LEGALLY CARRIED. I DO NOT KNOW THE REASON WHY THE FUEL HAULER FAILED TO STOP OR EVEN SLOW DOWN, BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE THIS EVEN TO DETERMINE THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF THE COLLISION AND TAKE SUITABLE ACTION.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,45000,"FIRST CLASS TRANSPORT, INC.",US,

The cause of this derailment was attributed to a gapped switch point and irregular cross-level of track at point of derailment. TILX 110483 derailed on its side and struck other rail cars standing on an adjacent track when derailing. This impact at the top valve housing cover area resulted in a compromise at TILX 110483's pressure plate releasing product. TILX 110483 was uprighted at 0105 hrs. PDT, 5/16/2011 which ended any further product release. Air monitoring was initiated and continued throughout this incident. The remaining lading within TILX 110483 was transferred to another suitable tank car on 5/16/2011 without further incident. Ground spillage was neutralized in place.

SAFETY COORDINATOR,5000 Bayway Drive,BAYTOWN,TX,77520,Facility,"During the loading of Trimac trailer 496059 the atmospheric pressure relief valve opened when the trailer pressure exceeded the set point.  The loading sequence was stopped immediately and the relief valve closed after 4.65 pounds of VOC was vented to the atmosphere.   Our investigation with Trimac has revealed that there were two mechanical failures and a loader oversight.  A Trimac power unit air line leak to the vapor recovery valve caused the valve to close allowing pressure to increase in the trailer.  Additionally, the ExxonMobil vapor recovery line low flow cut-out switch failed to operate and shut down the loading when the vapor recover valve closed and pressure starting building in the trailer.  Finally, the loader failed to follow the loading checklist and shut down the loading operation when the pressure increased above 20 psig.",Trimac and ExxonMobil will continue to follow our inspection and preventative maintenance programs to minimize the potential for future defects.  ExxonMobil has decided to evaluate the current frequency of inspection and PM for the low flow cut-out switch for potential changes.  ExxonMobil will re-enforce loader expectations of using the loaders checklist and ensuring all trailers remain below 20 psig during the loading.,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,ExxonMobil,US,

The shipper found lading leaking from the liquid induction line closure cap. Slight internal tank car pressure from afternoon temperature expansion caused lading to push out past the defective closure. Appears tank car was offered with pipe cap closure not properly prepared with teflon tape and tool tight. The shipper responder thought cause may have been worn cap threads and applied a new closure cap with teflon tape correcting the release. Photo inspection of the old closure cap threads appear that device should have functioned correctly. The release is estimated at 4 gallons. The shipper neutralized the released Sulfuric acid. Shipper responder was Charles Kosh, 409-985-0237.     KCS emergency services were activated to provide for railroad safety qualified services to mitigate this emergency (e.g., special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, management oversight, train/yard crew delay, and regulatory notification reports).  KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 may apply.    Note,  Item 27, amount in package, was estimated by f5800.1 report preparer. This action was required to facilitate data acceptance by defective PHMSA DOT IT system edits. Specifically, this estimated quantity was required for two reasons:   (1)because the shipper only provided bulk quantity on shipping paper, as 1 Tank Car, per PHMSA DOT requirements; and   (2)because the PHMSA DOT e-system requires data in this field which match the same units of measure as found in the capacity field.   KCS will continue to report in this fashion unit instructed differently by DOT or PHMSA.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

The driver called Martin Transport and reported the drip and the tire.  Martin Transport reported the incident to La State Police.   On close inspection, it was determined that a shell repair performed several years ago had failed and a pinhole opening had formed at a repair weld.  When traveling down the road, product would slosh up and out of the pinhole opening.  However, if the trailer was sitting still, no leak was detected.  The product was transferred into another Martin Transport trailer and delivered to the customer.  The trailer was cleaned and purged of all product and delivered to Geo's Tank Service for repairs.

I44 Service Rd.,Oklahoma City,OK,73173,Carrier,"On May 28, 2011 at approximately 8:30am, a company driver had just completed loading at COG Operating - Beverly Lease (oil well site) on County Road 25 (gravel) East of Crane, Texas.  While proceeding on County Road 25, the driver took his attention off the road for a moment and allowed his front steer tire and duals to fall off the improved roadway onto the soft shoulder.  The driver immediately responded to the situation and attempted to bring the transport back on top of the roadway.  In doing so, the driver over-corrected his steering.  This inappropriate reaction caused the weight of the load to carry the tractor-trailer over on its right side.  The tractor trailer came to rest in the bar ditch on the north side of the road.  The drive exited the cab and immediately notified his supervisor.  Crane County Sheriff's Department responded to the scene.  TXDPS declined to respond.  Company personnel responded to the scene and expedited a response to include:  Load transfer to another truck, uprighting the damaged transport, and cleaning up the affected area.  Approximately 10-15 gallons of crude oil were released from the cargo tank due to a damaged rubber sleeve connecting the cargo tank vent valve to the vent line.  The spilled crude oil was recovered and removed from the site.","The root cause of this lay-over accident was due to the driver's inappropriate reaction to the situation of dropping the tires off the improved roadway.  Contributing factors also include multi-tasking while driving and inattention to surroundings.  The vehicle's estimated speed just before the lay-over was 15 mph.  The driver had enought time and sufficient shoulder to respond appropriately.  The driver should have maintained his direction of travel, and slowly applied the brakes until he came to rest.

The fuel was being transferred via pump-off procedures to the receiving trailer. The trailer  had (5) individual tank compartments,each of which had a gate valve for ingress and egress of fuel. The transfer of fuels was being completed by (2) (ACF) personnel. Upon completion of the  3rd  compartment from the rear the employee, Aneel Singh proceeded to close the gate valve prior to disconnecting the transfer hose and moving to compartment (4). The gate valve was turned down to a stopping point indicating it was  closed. But upon disconnection it was immediately apparent that the valve had not fully closed. The employee promptly dealt with the situation and wrestled the valve closed by opening it slightly and forcing it past the sticking point in the valve thus ending the flow of fuel.  The resulting spill was approximately (25) gallons of Jet Fuel. Gulfstream Heavylift  was immediately notified and they contacted the Fire Department. The spill was contained and on asphalt. At no point did any fuel reach any natural resources or do any damage to the environment. The fueling operation  ceased and the trailer  was secured.  (ACF) called our emergency response company,Cliff Berry, and had them immediately respond to the incident. The estimated release was (25) gallons. I have copied you on the non-hazardous waste manifest  from Cliff Berry but will summarize here for you. The result of the cleanup, combined with the water sprayed by the fire department is as follows:    600 Lbs. of (Used oil Dry)  70 Gallons of (Non-processable solids/sludge from wastestream)  700 Gallons of (oily water for re-cycle)      We were advised that no further action was required in light of the fact the situation was handled by the Port and it's response personnel. Mainly in part due to the small size of the spill. The ruling from the fire department and the Port Director  was that the trailer  that caused the incident would no longer be permitted in the Port going forward. The trailer was returned to the Bahamas and will not be returned to the states again.  The direct cause of the incident was a faulty gate valve on the trailer. The trailer  was manufactured previous to 1980 and all systems on it were old and in various stages of dis-repair. The release of fuel was less than a minute and the valve was forced closed. Immediately upon release the employees of (ACF) began to contain the spill with pads and pigs. Cliff Berry advised us that the spill did not exceed 25 gallons and was well contained. The expense of cleanup would have further been reduced had the fire department not watered down the situation which spread it further. I have also copied you on the Cliff Berry billing to show the breakdown of services and charges.  I,Charles Eldon,owner of Atlantic Coastal Fuels,","In light of the situation that occurred, first and foremost the trailer in question is not permitted in the Port for further transport of fuel. More importantly, all future transfers will and are being performed by either myself or my immediate senior supervisor. We are thoroughly checking the units to be filled prior to any transfer operations. Also taking precautionary measures during as well as at the end of loading procedures to insure all components are secured and closed prior to any disconnections being made. Going forward the trailers will be phased out and be replaced by more reliable ISO containers as per agreement with Port of Palm Beach Director. The equipment that failed is owned and maintained by a offshore entity. We already have one (ISO) unit in operation and are acquiring more to facilitate the needs of this customer.  Atlantic Coastal Fuels strives to maintain the utmost in safety and is thorough in procedures regarding hazardous materials. All the necessary changes have been made to insure this type of incident does not have a re-occurrence.

He did declare it to the TSA at the Security checkpoint.  The TSA examined it but did not ask for a Doctor's prescription.  The passenger advised that it was for medical use for himself and the TSA allowed him to continue with it to the gate.  Again, Passenger Allen did not declare his Liquid Oxygen tank to the gate agent.    Once boarded and the aircraft was in the process of taxiing for takeoff/on takeoff roll, a Flight Attendant noticed the passenger was doing things with his carry-on stowed under the seat in front of him.  Shortly after takeoff, the Flight Attendant investigated and discovered the passenger had a canula around his neck and attached to his nose.  The passenger did not seem to realize that he was doing anything wrong.  By the original quick inspection of the device, the Flight Attendant determined that maybe it was a Portable Oxygen Concentrator (POC).  However, she questioned why she had not been informed by ground personnel that the device was on-board per company procedure.  A second Flight Attendant became involved.  Her inspection revealed that the device was developing frost on the outside of the container and then she discovered the small Class 5.1, Oxidizer and Class 2.2, Non-Flammable Gas labels on the canister.  The passenger was immediately directed by the Flight Attendant to turn off/close the valve on the device.  The Captain was informed and made the decision to divert back to the Norfolk Airport because indications were that the canister contained Liquid Oxygen which is forbidden on passenger aircraft.    Upon arrival at the gate, local authorities met the flight.  The passenger and the Liquid Oxygen canister were removed from the aircraft and the flight redeparted.      There was no release other than the gaseous oxygen that the passenger inhaled during the brief duration of the flight.","Mr. Allen was a non-revenue passenger.  He is the son of an employee and has sickle cell anemia.  He had recently began using oxygen of his own choosing when he walks long distances and becomes exhausted.  The employee is his mother and was not awar that her son had begun using oxygen.      Procedures are being changed to improve automated e-mail communications to non-revenue passengers to ensure when they are booked that they understand the dangers associated with carrying prohibited or forbidden hazardous materials.  In addition, the Trip Book that applies to all employees and their authorized travellers is being ammended again to specifically include Liquid Oxygen as an item that cannot be carried.
