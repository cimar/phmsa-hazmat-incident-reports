During the offloading/loading process a small stream of liquid material was noticed by the employees performing the job. The employees reacted quickly, discovered the leaking container, controlled the leak by placing the drum onto its side and then overpacked the container into a metal overpack. The leaking container released approximately 2 gallons of material onto the floor of the trailer and some dripped to the ground below. All spill materials were cleaned up by trained in-house Veolia personal, and properly placed into approved DOT containers for disposal. During the incident investigation by the employees it was discovered that there was a metal weld on the floor of the trialer which was raised from surface of the floor. The weld caught the bottom chime of the drum causing it to bend/tear causing the leak.","To prevent reoccurence in the future, the Veolia employees will check ALL trailers for sharp objects that may cause damage to containers which will be loaded onto the trailers.

While traveling, icy road conditions caused the Steffey Transport, Inc. vehicle to jackknife, which ruptured the first compartment of the tank truck. Approximately 2,700 gallons of diesel fuel were released.  The Kentucky State Police responded to assess the site.  Diesel fuel had released to the asphalt roadway and soil adjacent to the road shoulder.  Eco-Tech USA, LLC of London, Kentucky was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Eco-Tech USA LLC applied absorbent material to the free liquid along the affected roadway, and recovered the free product.  Absorbent boom was placed within nearby storm drains, as a precautionary measure, to prevent migration.  Site was secured, pending inspection during regular daylight hours.  Upon further investigation of site the following day, diesel fuel was detected within soils adjacent to shoulder.  No evidence of diesel fuel was present within the storm drains, and no water was affected.  Jason Taylor, KYEMA inspector, also inspected site, and confirmed storm drains were not affected, and no state waters were impacted by the release.  Upon receipt of applicable permits and utility locates, Eco-Tech USA, LLC excavated the impacted soils and restored site to preexisting condition.  Disposal was coordinated in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  There were no injuries or exposures as a result of the release.","Steffey Transport, Inc. will continue to train and reinforce safe handling procedures and driver safety to all personnel.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,79500,SPILL CENTER INC.,US,

During the course of  the trip, the driver made a routine stop at Clean Harbor’s in transit storage facility in order to consolidate less than a truck load quantities onto a single  transport vehicle for continued transportation. While in storage pending continued transportation, an inspection of the containers identified that one individual container had failed allowing material to escape onto the floor of the trailer and asphalt dock area. Facility personnel assembled a response team and after donning appropriate personal protective equipment, entered the trailer. Upon further inspection, it was discovered that the container failed on the contaners body. The response team repackaged remaining product into suitable 5 gallon container and used a chemically compatible absorbent material to absorb all free liquids. This material, along with materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and placed into a suitable UN rated container.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking or damage was observed. It is believed that during storage due to temperature change pressure built up in the container causing the head pressure to burp the air out of the container causing a vacuum and the body to fail.

The car was isolated and the shipper, PCS Sales, Ohio EPA, and the NRC were notified via CHEMTREC report 2012-01-04-00122. SWS Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and cleaned up the spilled material. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Virgil Fowler 706-564-8423. CSXT Mechanical personnel used a patching material to seal the small weld seam fracture. The leak was secured and after verification from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) that movement approval was not required, the car was released for transport.

STOCKTON,FLEET MANAGER,220 W. 4th Street,Joplin,MO,64802,Carrier,"On January 18, 2012 at approximately 10:57 AM, our driver Bernie Kave with Allmine Trucking LLC had just loaded hot asphalt coating at Allmine Paving LLC in Inwood, WV, had traveled from the plant at 200 Development Drive, Inwood, WV (MM #8 off of I-81) to mile marker 20 northbound on I-81 and noticed a rough ride from the trailer.  Bernie Kave exited at mile marker 20, through the intersection and pulled over on the paved shoulder of the on-ramp at exit #20 (northbound I-81).    When checking for the rough ride of the trailer that he later determined was a deflated suspension air bag, he notice a small puddle (approximately 12” in diameter) of coating forming under the trailer near the ladder rack on the passenger side.  He observed a small hole in the outer skin of the insulated tanker about the size of a pencil hole that the coating was coming from.  He immediately obtained the spill kit from his tractor and contained the spill which grew to approximately 16” in diameter and no more than ¼” thick.      Due to the colder outside temperature, the small pencil sized hole created its own seal and stopped the leak.  Bernie Kave and his supervisor (Bert Nichols) then used the spill kit in the tractor to remove the product from the shoulder for proper disposal.    The unit was then dispatched on to final destination in Frederick, MD to TAMKO Building Products, Inc. wherein it was determined that further material had leaked between the outer skin and the inner tank.  This material was contained on site at the plant in Frederick, MD during the unloading process.    Allmine Trucking LLC contracted with Baltimore Tank and had the outer skin removed from the tank and a full inspection revealed that prior to owning this tank trailer, a previous owner had cleaned the tank using some sort of mechanical device (air chisel) and had damaged the tank internally (from the inside out) thus creating several damaged areas on the interior of the tank.  Allmine Trucking LLC had previously had this tank cleaned on the 30th of December, 2011 with high pressure water.  This was the first load of coating that was hauled in the tank since being cleaned.  The old coating removed by the high pressure water uncovered the previously damaged areas and allowed the tank to leak on January 18, 2012.  Baltimore Tank also indicated that corrosion that has occurred between the outer skin/insulation and the exterior of the tank, combined with the air chisel damage from the inside cleaning both contributed to the leak in this tank.","Allmine Trucking LLC has placed this particular tank trailer out of service until it can either be properly repaired or replaced.  Allmine Trucking LLC will have the other tanks in its fleet inspected for any previous damage and will also have any new or used equipment purchased in the future subject to a pre-buy inspection, capable of detecting any structural integrity issues with this type of equipment.",No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Allmine Trucking LLC,US,

At 9:50 am, the driver called the plant operator to report that he saw product leaking from the trailer and that he was on his way back to the plant.  After the driver returned to the plant, product was found on the floor of the trailer.  Absorbent was applied to the spill area and the trailer was unloaded.  At pallet number 6, a puncture measuring approximately 1.5” by .5” was discovered about 4” from the bottom of a drum, and the trailer’s metal side wall was torn, with metal protruding from the side wall at a location corresponding to where the punctured drum was found.  Product above the puncture point had leaked from the drum.  Absorbent was applied to the spilled product in the truck, and it was scooped up and put into drums for proper disposal.  The outside of the trailer was wiped with rags, which were properly handled and disposed of.  The trailer was then sent to Qualawash to be washed inside and outside of the trailer.","A 1/4/2012 Root Cause Report and investigation identified a need for improved inspection procedures prior to loading.  A more effective inspection method will be implemented.  In addition, poor lighting may have been a factor in the incident; high-powered spot lights have been ordered to improve lighting in the trailer-loading area.  An evaluation is planned of the procedures in place for transportation incidents when the plant is notified of an emergency.

GREG CUNNINGHAM,REGULATORY COMPLIANCE COORDINATOR,,,,,Carrier,"Driver reported that car had swerved in front of him, applied brakes then exited road. This caused driver to brake excessively to avoid hitting car. Truck was carrying 11 IBCs of ferric chloride and 3 of caustic soda.Truck is a 10 wheel straight truck with flat bed and permanent side rails. Load was set back one pallet space from front of trailer to distribute weight off of steering axle. In front of load was a load bar attached to rails of trailer acting as the bulkhead of load. When brakes were applied, bar broke when 2 totes of ferric moved forward about 10 inches. One tote received a small (less than 1/2 inch) puncture/crack at corner of tank producing a steady seeping of product. Driver stopped truck at first safe place (about 1/2 mile) to inspect load and discovered leaking IBC. Seeping continued for approximately 2 hours while response team traveled to site and performed clean up. Driver applied, absorbent pads and 'pigs' to contain spilled material while waiting for response team. Approximately 5 gallons was lost. Response was by Brenntag personnel. Material was transferred from leaking IBC to new IBC, trailer floor cleaned, all contaminated dirt gathered and removed. Load was secured against further movement. The RQ (1,000 Ibs) was not reached.","Review of the incident revealed that the temporary bulkhead was insufficient to prevent forward movement of cargo in an emergency braking event. All the IBCs loaded on this truck had galvanized steel frames. The truck bed is steel, resulting in metal on metal which contributed to the IBCs being more likely to move. The load bar was placed near the upper third of the IBCs with no blocking at the floor. Corrective action is to (1) add a second load bar at the floor against the IBCs and (2) place empty pallets on the floor between the truck bulkhead and the floor mounted load bar for additional load securement. The new configuration for this type load will be pallets on the floor against the truck bulkhead. A load bar flush against the pallets on the floor and attached to the side rails. The IBCs loaded flush against the floor mounted load bar with a second load bar against the upper third of the 2 IBCs at front of the load. We believe this will prevent forward movement in a similar hard braking event.",No,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,

Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

Upon arriving at the customer location, the driver inspected the trailer and verified that the shipments were all still secured and did not discover any problems with the freight.  The customer began loading pallets into the trailer (while being observed by the driver, who notified the   customer of the metal located along the side of the trailer).

The car was isolated and the shipper, Veolia Environmental Services was contacted through their emergency response number.  HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a continuous leak of liquid being emitted from the re-closing pressure relief device.  The pressure relief device spring was checked and no exceptions were noted.  The cause of the release was determined to be from over pressurization of the container.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the Veolias Transportation Logistics Manager, Tim Ludwig at 732-469-5100.  Contractor personnel off loaded 150 gallons of product and the leak subsided. The leak was secured and the car released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move.

The area was isolated to prevent spreading the material and possible contamination.  Con-way Safety contacted ERTS to coordinate corrective action.  The ERTS dispatched BBU to manage a UN2811 toxic solid inorganic methylene release.  BBU personnel arrived on site to investigate the release and began cleanup operations.  The contractor placed the material from the damaged bag into a 95 gallon poly overpack drum.  The contractor utilized absorbents to collect the released material, which was containerized into an overpack drum along with the damaged bag.

A 3/8"" nipple on the suction side of the ethanol off-loading pump fractured and caused ethanol to be released from the inbound ethanol line onto the ground.  The 3/8"" nipple connected a pressure transmitter to the main ethanol line.  The driver immediately stopped the pump and closed his valve.  He then contacted a terminal employee, alerting him to the issue.  The terminal employee closed down the inbound ethanol line and placed a drip pan under the compromised fitting.  The supervisor was called on the radio who mobilized two vacuum trucks and additional spill response equipment.  A gas meter was monitored to ensure proper vapor control and the area was cordonned off from traffic.  Approximately 100 gallons of ethanol product impacted the concrete spill containment and surrounding road.  All was cleaned up.  The 3/8"" nipple connected a pressure transmitter to the main ethanol line.  The nipple and transmitter had been installed years earlier and were not located in the proper location.  The nipple extended out from the line horizontally before connecting with the transmitter.  This put stress on the nipple and the equipment was located on the side of the line instead of on top, exposing it to potential impact from personnel.","1. A ball valve was installed between the nipple and main line to ensure this location could be better isolated in the event of another similar incident.             2.

After exiting about a 1/4 mile from the facility the driver noticed a drip from his trailer. It was approximately 2:35 pm.  He immediately stopped to investigate and found that the vent valve was left open and product had splashed out.  He ran in to notify Rhodia that he had a spill and needed assistance and also notified Univar dispatch.  Brian Faust in Regulatory was contacted at approximately 2:50 pm and called in the spill to OES at 3:10 pm case # 12-0528. He also contacted ECI to mobilize a spill clean-up team at 3:20 pm. Rhodia personnel helped our driver isolate the area and notified local emergency responders. Prior to isolation a civilian car drove through the spill and stopped in the Rhodia parking lot.  A passenger got out of the car to look under the car for damages and got sulfuric on his right shoulder.  Rhodia personnel immediately got him under a safety shower for 15 minutes.  He refused to go to our clinic and said he would follow-up with his own doctor tomorrow.  He had minor skin surface irritation (no blistering or bubbling).   The car had damage to the paint and was decontaminated by Rhodia personnel.  Vinny Sharma (BOM) sent the driver for a drug/alcohol screen per Univar policy, ensured the clean up by ECI was being handled properly and ensured all Univar policies were followed.","Primary reasons for the incident were;  1. Driver left vent down valve in open position after relieving pressure in the tanker trailer before opening the dome lid to load.  After loading the trailer with sulfuric acid 93%, the trailer was driven which created sloshing of product that leaked out of the vent down valve because the valve was in the open position.    2. Operator Error – did not follow bulk trailer loading procedure pertaining to venting down a trailer and verifying all valves closed prior to driving a trailer. Driver became complacent with filling the inspection form, as he filled this form 2 to 3 times daily.    Safety Committee recommends the following;  1. Utilize Univar checklist for loading and offloading bulk products (OSM 3.13 x 1, Prototype Tank Truck Loading Checklist).  Provide training, document retention plan and periodic audit.   2. Conduct Safety Stand Down (All Hands) meeting at SE Santa Fe Springs branch to review the incident, discuss findings and safety behaviors, action plan to prevent recurrence.   3. Provide re-fresher training for all Bulk and Mini-Bulk drivers at SE Santa Fe Springs branch on HazMat Emergency Response off-site procedure pertaining to the order of steps and priorities for a release:  Evaluate & Protect, Notify, Control & Contain, Clean Up.   4. Evaluate equipment design (valve, switches, hose, etc) on bulk trailers used to perform trailer vent down function.  Eliminate driver decision making to close critical isolation valves  by designing systems with an interlock or mechanical linkage to ensure valve closure prior to moving a bulk tanker trailer.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3940,UNIVAR USA INC.,US,

Harris County Sheriff’s Deputy Oldner dispatched the County Hazmat Team to respond to the site.  Garner Environmental Services of Deer Park, Texas was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Linden Bulk Transportation Co., Inc. supplied two (2) empty trailers for offload of damaged tanker.  Upon completion of transfer, cargo tank was uprighted and recovered from the site.  Garner Environmental Services, Inc. placed absorbent boom into nearby drainage ditches to prevent migration, and recovered the contaminated soils from the impacted roadside ditch.  Due to heavy rains during recovery efforts, some product had been washed down roadside ditch, and was unrecoverable.  Garner Environmental Services, Inc. worked at the direction of Harris County’s Pollution Control Unit to adequately remediate the affected area.

DURHAM,ATTORNEY,"808 TRAVIS, SUITE 1300",Houston,TX,77002,Other-ATTORNEY-IN-FACT FOR CAR,"On January 03, 2012, NALCO Co. consigned DHL for delivery of 20 foot container to Luba Freeport LTD, in Equatorial Guinea.  The container held seven tote tanks; three containing NALCO EC1118A hazardous material UN 2924 (ENERCEPT EC1118A) and four containing non-hazardous material Oceanic HW-525P.  Bill of Lading No. 118953592 was issued for the shipment.      Universal Africa Lines (UAL) had scheduled the container to be shipped onboard their chartered vessel, FLINTERMAR.  The container was stowed, blocked and braced by Unique Carrier Services of Houston, Texas.  The dock receipt indicates that the shipment was received on January 16, 2012.    On January 29, 2012, at 1930 hours, Container DUCU206820-6 was loaded into the No. 2 cargo hold tween deck of the M/V FLINTERMAR as she was berthed at Manchester Terminal, Houston, Texas.    On January 30, 2012, at 1100 hours, the vessel’s crew noticed a strong aromatic odor coming from cargo hold No. 2 and it was found that the container was leaking an oily like substance.  Gulf Stream Stevedores immediately contacted Oil Mop Inc., to conduct the cleanup of the vessel and the container.  The container and cargo hold were de-contaminated through absorption of the spilled compound, ventilation and using a vapor absorbing compound referred to as HIDEAWAY.    The vessel also carrying a cargo of calcium chloride stored in super sacks.  The initial cleanup was not successful because the compound had run underneath the bags of calcium chloride.  After approximately 35 bags of cargo were removed from the vessel, the cleanup was completed on January 31, 2012.       The spill can be attributed to a 3” screw nail being inadvertently driven into   one of the tote tanks containing the ENERCEPT 1118-A compound.  It was determined that the container was not lying perfectly flat in the storage area causing the liquid to run towards the rear of the container.  When the container was placed onboard the vessel it was at a time when the vessel had a slight port list.  Overnight approximately 60 gallons of the ENERCEPT 1118-A leaked out of the container and into the No. 2 cargo hold.     On January 30, 2012, at 1900 hours, the cargo hatches were closed and ventilated.  A marine chemist was contacted and boarded the vessel at 0800 hours on January 31, 2012.  The vapors showed a concentration of 42 PPM in the No. 2 cargo hold.  The master sent all crew members to undergo toxicology screening at a local clinic.  All crew members tested negative for exposure.      On January 31, 2012, at 1800 hours, OMI completed clean up operations and on February 1, 2012, at 0800 hours the marine chemist returned to the vessel, re-tested the vapor concentration of the No. 2 cargo hold, and cleared the hold for loading.    Loading re-commenced at 1300 hours on February 1, 2012, and the FLINTERMAR sailed for foreign waters at 0100 hours on February 2, 2012.",BETTER CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN BY THOSE CHARGED WITH SECURING THE TOTE TANK IN THE SHIPPING CONTAINER.

Customer retrieved a section of hose and brought it to driver who connected to his hose and customer hook up.  He failed to secure the cam locks on customer hose with velcro.  During the unloading process, a customer hose cam lock came loose, allowing the hose section to separate and release product.  Process was quickly shut down.

Call in from Critical Incident Desk (CID) Dennis Goad stated that the loaded tank car is dripping product from the bottom outlet valve at approx 1 drip per 10-15 seconds. The CID notified Steve McNealy of KCS and Mr. McNealy requested United States Environmental Services LLC (USES) respond to investigate and perform corrective actions on the railcar. Mr. Jason Nevills of USES responded to the request and was dispatched with equipment and personnel to the site.    Southern Ionics Inc. (shipper) sent response personnel to the site as well. USES coordinated with Southern Ionics Inc. to develop plan of action to be taken. USES and crew arrived on-site at 1530 hours CST and performed a site safety briefing. Upon arriving onsite USES personnel were informed by Southern Ionics Inc. that the leak was from the unloading assembly on the BOV.     It was determined that the unloading assembly had an auxillary loading appurtenance that was left on the BOV and that the appurtenance was DOT non-compliant. The auxillary appurtenance is utilized in the loading and un-loading of material and is not fit for travel.  The auxillary appurtenance was removed and it was observed that the unloading assembly was leaking from the internal plunger spring which was defective. The defective spring and plunger were replaced with new parts. Upon re-installing the assembly no leakage was visible or detected.     USES then checked the man-way area of the railcar and found all the plugs and fittings were tight and secure. USES personnel then secured the car. Upon completion of the investigation and corrective actions performed USES informed Mr. McNealy that the job was complete.     *File Note Item 19 - the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     *File Note Item 27 - Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to the carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.     *The delay of the submittal of this 5800 form is partly due to the fact that KCS discovered that more than just this car in the shipper's fleet contained the DOT non-complaint ""quick-connect"" appurtenance and KCS continued to work with the shipper to assure that all of the auxillary appurtenances were removed before any further shipment.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions. The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

I left the Proctor office immediately for Duffy’s.    Upon arrival I met Terry, the Branch Manager for Noonan out of West Rutland, VT, and the driver of the transport, John.  Terry explained that one of their 4-inch transport hoses had failed, causing a discharge of fuel oil to the interior of the concrete containment pad.   The failure caused spray to the interior of the dike, as well as to the exterior of the dike beyond the containment area.   Terry estimated total discharge of approximately 10 gallons.  Based upon my observations, I concurred with Terry’s assessment of volume.   Although the majority of the discharged fuel had been contained by the containment concrete pad, when I arrived, Noonan had already placed approximately 20 square feet of sorbent on the ground outside the containment area where the fuel had gathered from the spray of the broken hose.  The ground was frozen solid, it had snowed about an inch that morning, and the sorbent appeared to have soaked up the free product that had hit the ground outside the containment area.   Given the frozen state of the ground, it was clear that little of the free product outside the containment area had been absorbed by the ground; rather it remained on the surface of the frozen soil.  Beyond the 20 square foot area affected outside the containment area, the snow was slightly pink in color from the spray, but there was no free product beyond the 20 square foot area.  Terry informed me that he had already called the State of Vermont Spill hotline and that Clean Harbors, that Noonan’s environmental firm had been called, and that Clean Harbors was on their way.  I considered the discharge to be under control and already contained by Noonan’s people when I arrived on site.  I called the State of Vermont, spoke to Tim, at 230pm and reported the discharge.  I also called the National Response Center and reported the discharge (report # 999769) and shortly thereafter called Bill of HOP and recounted the description above.  Bill gave me an incident number, which I recorded as #10606  Over the course of the afternoon, I re-visited the site 3 more times and visited with Terry to make sure nothing had changed.  On my last visit, sometime around 530p, Terry was still on site, and a Clean Harbors staff person was on site, using an iron bar to chip away the top layer of frozen solid where the free product had gathered outside the containment area.   Clean Harbors already had a waste containment drum on site and had already placed a portion of affected soil into the waste drum.
