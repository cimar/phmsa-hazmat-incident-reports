THE BOXES WERE STRETCH WRAPPED WITH PLASTIC FILM TO WOODEN PALLETS.  THIS WAS THE ONLY SHIPMENT ON THE TRAILER.  TWO PALLETS OF THE BOXES NEAR THE REAR OF THE TRAILER TIPPED OVER APPARENTLY WHEN THE VEHICLE MADE A TURN, AND THE IMPACT APPARENTLY CAUSED TWO 5 GALLON BLADDERS INSIDE OF TWO BOXES TO BURST AND THE FORMALIN INSIDE OF TWO BOXES TO SPILL ONTO AND SOAK INTO OTHER FIBERBOARD BOXES IN THE PALLETS AND ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER. WHEN THE PICK-UP DRIVER TOOK THE TRAILER TO THE STORAGE LOT OF THE TERMINAL FACILITY AT ROMULUS, MI, AND WALKED TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER, HE DETECTED A VERY STRANGE ODOR COMING FROM THE TRAILER AND OPENED IT'S DOOR AND DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM AND NOTIFIED THE MANAGER AT THE ROMULUS AGENCY TERMINAL.

THE SPILLED FORMALIN WAS CONTAINED AND ABSORBED WITH OIL DRY (GROUND CLAY).  THE STRETCH WRAP WAS REMOVED FROM THE TIPPED PALLETS.  THE UNHARMED BOXES WRE RESTRETCH-WRAPPED ONTO PALLETS.  IT WAS THEN DETERMINED THAT 30 DAMAGED BOXES HAD THEIR PLASTIC BLADDERS IN TACT AND WERE NOT LEAKING AND THAT TWO 5 GALLON BLADDERS HAD BURST AND WERE EMPTY.
