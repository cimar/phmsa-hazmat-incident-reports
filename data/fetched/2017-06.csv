This package was shipped without any of the proper certifications/markings/paperwork. The package was discovered because it was poorly packed, so the tank ripped out of the box it was in.  New Comments: Hello Tammy, there was some confusion with this one from an Admin. This package came in as an undeclared HAZMAT, no labeling and no HAZMAT service code, but it was noticed by the type of product, a tank of refrigerant. The Admin held it and didn't reach out to management or safety right away, but did reach out to the shipper about it and they stated that someone would pick it up. The Admin then thought since someone was going to pick it up that it didn't need any type of SCM Sentry. Then we got a call back saying they would not retrieve it. I did speak with this admin about the importance of when in doubt to contact management, district safety, or PGH safety with any questions regarding HAZMAT?s or even something resembling a HAZAMT and gave him the Internal FedEx Hazmat Operation Hotline and where he can find it on the Safety page . I also explained that it would need to go through the HAP process and coded as a 97 and a new label would need created through there putting on a new service code for a HAZMAT. I am currently doing the BCSA test for Damaged Hazardous Material Reporting today and will conduct a full out audit for the current year. I have it planned for Safety week, and the new fiscal year, to conduct a special emphasis meeting with all Admin over the importance of safe and timely HAZMAT dispositions and handling.",,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

The road to the location not in good condition due to a work-over rig having done work recently.  As the driver was leaving the location, he stated that he heard something pop. He immediately stopped and pulled the hood to inspect the shocks, but then saw oil on the ground and a mud flap sticking in the barrel of the tanker.  The driver did not have phone service so he sent a message to my Terminal Manager via the onboard communication system.  He then went and vented the trailer to stop the leak from spraying as bad as it was.  The pumper drove up to the scene and assisted in notification to the terminal.  Driver tied a rag around the wires adjacent to the hole and pushed into the opening cutting down the release.  The leaking trailer continued for approximately an hour until it was off-loaded by second tanker we sent to the scene to assist.  Driver bermed the area immediately surrounding the leak, but crude exceeded the bermed area and entered the adjacent pond.",The investigation found that the tractor mud flap bracket could be drilled and have a pin installed preventing the flap from working itself up.

This tank car was received by the railyard about two weeks prior to the incident, and was constructively placed on a yard track until the patron could receive the car at their facility. Our Emergency Response Plan was initiated and began with notifications to the following agencies and entities; Local EMS, Local Fire Department, NRC, FRA, PUC, PEMA, PA DEP, Norfolk Southern Hazmat Compliance Officer and Northridge Group Inc. Environmental Response. The action plan was to continue to let the car vent and polymerize until the material became stable to begin the clean up process. After a mechanical inspection of the car, it was discovered that the liquid line gasket had a three inch rupture on it causing the car to vent through the rupture. The cause of the reaction is currently unknown, however it is suspected that there may have been some contamination in the tank car prior to loading. The shipper of the material flew their chemists to the site to examine and test the material, temperature of the car and temperature of the contents of the car. The command center was located at the Lock Yard Office for mitigating the incident. The release duration occurred for 20 hours and clean up occurred for 8 hours. Through this duration, the car was attended by our emergency response contractor, Northridge, to ensure control of the site.","No recommendations as this was the shipper's issue.

The crew noticed a vapor cloud from the top of RCRX 1522, a loaded tank car of UN1789, hydrochloric acid. The tank car was isolated. The shipper, Reagent Chemical, was notified via Chemtrec, report #2017-06-06-00265. Hepaco, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene. Hepaco found the vapor line flange releasing vapor from a damaged flange gasket and less than tool tight flange bolts. The bolts were tightened and the release of vapors stopped. The shipper representative, Kevin Callais,(281) 404-9728 was notified of the situation found. The release was temporarily secured and RCRX 1522 was then moved to CSX Kingston, NY Yard for further inspection and repairs.     At the CSX Kingston, NY Yard RCRX 1522 was monitored using HCL acid tubes to ensure no vapors were being emitted out of the immediate tank car area. A replacement flange gasket was obtained and Specialized Professional Services Inc. (SPSI) a qualified C-6 repair shop was contracted to replace the flange gasket, properly secure and perform a pressure test to re-qualify tank car RCRX 1522. After the tank car was re-qualified it was released back into transportation.

Driver connected product hose to trailer compartment and opened trailer valve without connecting hose to store UST.  Approximately 52 gallons of gasoline spilled onto pavement and into man-made retention system.  Lawrenceville FD was called and responded to contain spill.  Aqua Terra Recycling was dispatched to clean spill.  Aqua-Terra dispatched a small trailer emergency spill unit and a vacuum truck.  Aqua-Terra noticed that there was a strong odor of gasoline around the trench drains and the storm drain that goes underground along the front of the adjacent McDonald's.  Aqua Terra personnel was shown where the retention pond was for the two properties. It was observed that there was free product in the storm inlet in front of McDonald's.  Aqua-Terra moved their vacuum truck to this area and commenced to remove water and product.  Lawrenceville had received periods of heavy rain prior to our arrival.  This had moved most of the product into the storm drain and the down gradient retention pond.  Absorbent booms were placed at the inlet to the McDonald's storm drain and the out fall of the storm drain that falls into the retention pond.  Equipment and material used: 1 bundle of absorbent pads, 3 bags of absorbent material, 1 bundle of booms, 2 metal 55 gallon drums.

The CTMV slid on pavement and came to rest partially on pavement and right shoulder.  The impact on the right side of the semi-trailer caused an internal bulkhead to crack.

MARTIN,OPERATIONS MANAGER,25800 Science Park Dr.,Cleveland,OH,44122,Carrier,"On Friday June 9, 2017 at 6:41 AM, Austin Powder Company multi-purpose bulk truck (MBT)was traveling northbound on County Road 25 in rural Marshall county Alabama.  The truck was loaded with bulk amounts of ammonium nitrate prill (UN1942), as well as ammonium nitrate emulsion (UN3375), and a tank containing 200 gallons of fuel oil (NA1993).  Packaged boosters (UN0042), and detonators (UN0245) were overpacked in an IME box on either side of the truck.   The truck left the road, traveling a short  distance on the shoulder.  The driver then attempted to get the truck back on the road, during which time he crossed a small portion of the road that was an embankment (over a culvert), which caused the vehicle to lose control.  The driver then attempted to get the vehicle back under control, but in doing so the truck over-corrected, causing it to overturn on the driver's side.  The vehicle slid for roughly 100 feet before it came to rest on the driver's side, perpendicular to the street.  Ammonium nitrate prill began to slowly leak from 2 of the bins, collecting on the street.  Nothing mechanically failed on these bins.  They simply leaked due to the fact that the truck was on its side. Also, a small amount of diesel fuel (a few gallons) leaked from the saddle tanks, mixing with the spilled nitrate.  First responders arrived shortly thereafter, as did a third-party spill crew dispatched by the shipper/carrier. The material was slowly leaking from the package for roughly 2 hours.  A total of around 1,000 pounds of material leaked.  The spill was completely cleaned up within roughly 3 hours. The driver had to be cut out of the vehicle, and was life flighted to a hospital for treatment of serious injuries.","If the driver returns to service, he will receive retraining prior to driving again, per policy and per requirements outlined in IME SLP-23. We have also retained a third-party accident reconstructionist, who has completed an in-depth report. The driver is still in the hospital at present, and largely unable to communicate, so we have been unable to interview him to help us in assigning a root cause to the accident.      Interviews were done with co-workers including one who witnessed the accident.  We  looked at his recent driver logs, studied mechanical and maintenance data on the truck, and generally reviewed the events of the day to better determine what may have contributed to the event.  However, until we interview the driver it will be difficult to arrive at a root cause, and therefore prescribe a course of action.",Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,208000,Autin Powder Company,US,

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the unloading operation  the pallet of drums was placed on uneven concrete floor.  As the forklift operator approached the pallet, the fork struck the drum.  The operator immediately stopped work and placed the drum on its side, halting the leak.    Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised  container into a suitable salvage drum. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and  placed into the salvage drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.","The root cause of the incident was determined to be unsafe forklift operation, a review of the incident and the unsafe practices was immediately reviewed with CHES.

During the transfer operation, it was discovered that approximately 1 quart of material had  escaped from a pinhole leak that had developed in the container. Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised  container into a suitable salvage drum. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and  placed into the salvage drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed. Drivers will continue to inspect each container during staging period as well as before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity.

During this hard braking event, the driver heard and felt the load shift. He immediately pulled over to a safe location to do a load integrity check, during which he smelled an odor coming from the trailer. The driver closed the trailer, and immediately reported a suspected release to his management. An emergency response team was dispatched to the scene. While wearing the correct personal protective equipment, the team entered the trailer to discover one drum had suffered a small release due to damage sustained during the hard braking event. The drum that had the release was over-packed, as well as several other dented but structurally intact drums, all damaged during the hard braking event. The load continued on to its final destination without incident.     The release was reported to the PA DEP report line at 15:05 on 06/8/17.","The driver was not allowed to directly supervise or be present for the building and securement of this load; it was handled by the generator’s facility personnel. The driver could only visually inspect and secure the rearmost part of the load. For myriad safety reasons, drivers are not permitted to walk on top of loads to verify proper securement; the driver was only able to effectively visually inspect the rear of the load. This load was not properly secured at intervals throughout the trailer and did not have sufficient dunnage to fill void spaces, leading to a damaging load shift under hard braking.     The generator has been consulted on this event, and asked to retrain facility personnel on proper load securement and use of dunnage to prevent any movement of packages in transportation in the future. The driver has been retrained on the need to supervise as closely as possible the load building and securement of all loads he will transport, and how to better ascertain the state of a load's securement through thorough and specific questioning of facility personnel where possible.The driver has also been retrained on when to ask to have a load rebuilt if the load securement is in doubt, or cannot be verified by the facility.",No,PAIL,"Pail, open head, capacity 10 gallons or less",PAIL,No,,,,,,,64,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,20000,"CLEAN HARBORS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.",US,

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the holding operation, it was discovered that approximately 30 gallons of material had escaped from a pinhole leak that had developed in the container. Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to transfer the material into drums.  In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used in the clean-up efforts were collected and placed into the suitable drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.  Although it is hard to say what exactly caused the leak, it appears the tote was rubbing against the steel frame for too long which eventually cause a small crack to the poly tank.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed. Drivers will continue to inspect each container before it is loaded and during staging period as well.   And will continue to take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity. IN addition, the shipper has been advised of the situation and have been asked to inspect all container used for the transport of waste materials to insure they meet all required  specifications.",No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc",US,

He shortly after discovered leaking from the front of the trailer as well. The driver notified his management and the local authorities immediately. In addition, the driver took immediate steps to contain the release, using a shovel to create a berm for containment.      The State of Vermont and the NRC were notified of the release. The State of Vermont DEC sent Ted Unkles to the scene to assist in the cleanup efforts. The EPA sent Ted Bazenas to the scene to assist in the cleanup efforts. The release and subsequent cleanup and remediation efforts were monitored by the Vermont DEC, the EPA, and the US DOT. The release and subsequent cleanup and remediation efforts were monitored by the Vermont DEC, the EPA, and the US DOT.      The police, local fire department, and hazardous materials response team responded to the scene and coordinated cleanup efforts. Clean Harbors dispatched a field services crew with the correct personal protective equipment to complete the discovery, cleanup, and site remediation. After the source of the release was identified, the other waste drums and totes of this load were decontaminated, loaded onto a trailer, and continued to their intended destination.     The release cleanup closed the roadway VT-103 in both directions from approximately 13:30 6/13/2017 to 11:00 6/14/2017.      It was determined that the polyethylene non-bulk package was punctured by a nail head that extended above the flat surface of the pallet on which the container was situated.","We will work with the client to ensure all drummed outgoing waste utilize only carefully inspected pallets in defect free condition, and care is taken in the placement of drums on those pallets.

Upon investigation he discovered that there was liquid product inside the crash box on the top of the tanker compartment.  The driver was questioned and it was determined that the wash out cap on the truck's vapor return line was missing.  The IMTT Chemical Operator asked the driver if he had a replacement gasket which he did and it was subsequently installed.  The driver was then asked to tighten the fittings on the dome lid.  US Ecology (IMTT's OSRO) was contacted to come to the area and wash out the Ethyl Acrylate from the truck's crash box area.  The truck was permitted to leave after it was determined that the leak had been addressed and no odor was being emitted.,IMTT personnel followed all proper procedures and is not responsible for defective components on the third party transporter's equipment. The  customer of the product was contacted and told of the incident.

No package failed, there was no release of toxic substances.  The employees' hands were severely injured requiring surgery and skin grafts.  She is recovering now.","The head of the electric match is made from a chemical composition that is somewhat friction and impact sensitive.  Employees are trained to not pull back the plastic protective shroud over the head of the match and not to subject the match head to friction or impact of any sort.  We are producing updated training material now to re-stress these points.  At times, a strand of black match (cotton twine impregnated with black powder) can be found in the receptacle that the match is inserted into.  We are procuring a non-sparking tool to push this blackmatch down to the bottom of the receptacle to insure that the head of the ematch has little chance to come into contact with it, to further reduce the chance of any friction on the head of any sort.  At times, the plastic protective shroud over the ematch head can be dislodged or pulled back.  We are likely to switch to a US ematch producer who provides an ematch with a shroud that cannot be pulled back.",Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,5,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,0,,,

The car was isolated and BNSF Hazmat responders assessed the release finding it not actively leaking but with wetness from the Vacuum Relief Valve which was threaded into the manway lid.  Responders vented and opened the tank car to inspect the VRV and found the VRV o-ring gasket was no longer sealing and had appeared to have expanded from its original sealing area.  The VRV was temporarily secured until the car could be placed on a repair track to have the valve removed and a plug installed in its place.  The plug was installed on 7/5/17.  No leaking material reached the ground, the approximately 1/2 gallon released from the car was isolated entirely to the car body.  The BNSF Hazmat team cleaned the residue from the car with rags and degreaser.

Upon investigation significant cargo shift was observed when the trailer door was opened. No securement was observed during the leak investigation and remediation. The leak was determined to involve 4 1-gallon pails of ""Crystal Clear Epoxy"" -UN2735 (amines) which were located on the right side of the trailer, on the bottom layer stretchwrapped and palletized. The pails were crushed by the cargo stacked on top of the pails.  The spill was remediated and unit was released to move outgate.

During this process approximately 15 gallons of material escaped.  The material spilled was immediately contained.  Absorbent material was applied to the spilled material and area. Drum was then successfully over packed. All absorbent and spill debris was placed in the over  pack drum and secured for shipment to the designated treatment facility.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, evidence of missing ring was observed and attempt was made to provide ring to drum.  Driver did not have the proper ring, which compounded the situation.  Driver should have never accepted the drum for transport.  The shipper has been advised of the situation and have been asked to inspect all containers used for the transport of waste materials to insure they meet all required specifications.  Drivers will continue to inspect each container during staging period as well as  before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity. Drivers will carry manufacturer drum closure instructions.  Should they not have the correct material they are instructed to deny the transport.

Employee worked the product tank and hooked up hoses to be prepared to load tanker trailer.  Employee took his break. Driver had truck valves closed, line valve closed, breather valve and tank valve open, PTO off. When break was finished, driver turned on the PTO to go load, when he exited the truck he saw oil spilling over the environmental box. He checked the valve again to make sure it was closed, then to the tank to close that valve. He opened my trailer valves and sucked the environmental box empty, then put oil pads out. He called the local site pumper to come help.  They notified their supervisors and reported the release.  The material was contained to the immediate area and was remediated by local personnel.  The driver failed to open the unload tank valve before starting the pump process and this was operator error.  Correcting this process entailed retraining the driver on proper procedures and not stopping mid-task to take a break.  Must continue through or not get distracted.  Learners were shared with all drivers.",Driver and fellow co-workers were retrained in the proper load and unload process.

DURING THE MORNING BRIEFING CALL, CARGO VERBALLY CONFIRMED THERE WAS A DG SHIPMENT FOR HA 445. AT 1200 CARGO SENT THE MANIFEST TO THE LOAD PLANNER, HOWEVER, NO SHIPMENT FOR HA 445 WAS INDICATED AS DG ON THE MANIFEST. THE LOAD PLANNER CALLED CARGO TO CONFIRM IF THERE WAS A DG SHIPMENT FOR HA 445 AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO DG FOR HA 445 WHICH CAUSED HIM TO ANNOTATE “NO DG” ON LOAD CLOSE OUT.   AFTER THE FLIGHT DEPARTED, THE LOAD MASTER TURNED IN HIS PAPERWORK TO THE LOAD PLANNER.

THE LOAD PLANNER CONTACTED DISPATCH AFTER VERIFYING WITH CARGO THAT DG WAS LOADED ABOARD HA 445. DISPATCH THEN CONTACTED THE PILOT IN-FLIGHT WITH THE DESCRIPTION AND LOADING INFORMATION. THE FLIGHT CONTINUED TO AKL WITHOUT A NOPIC ON-BOARD.
