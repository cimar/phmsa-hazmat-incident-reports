It was noted by the FRA inspector that all 6 manway bolts were significantly less than tool tight thus resulting in a non-accident release. Appropriate notifications were made to all parties involved. The car was spotted on a siding for a response team to arrive another day to clean up residue on the side of the car and to secure tank car appurtenances.     On Wednesday July 10, 2013 a response crew arrived at the Artesia to clean and secure the car. Upon further investigation it was discovered that not only were the manway bolts loose but there was no manway gasket present either. The response team installed a new, compatible manway gasket and secured a manway bolts tool tight. The released lading was cleaned and the car released into transportation    * No injuries reported    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non-accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence.   It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

The entrained intermodal flatcar that RDWY 280994 was atop was set-out of the train. RDWY 280994 was removed from its railcar and carefully moved to a containment/dock area for further inspection. Contract responders reported insufficient blocking and bracing allowed interior load shifting of the lading within RDWY 280994. Seven 5 gallon steel pails containing resin materials were found damaged and had leaked. Most of these pails were near empty due to dent punctures and cuts in these pail's sidewalls. The damaged pails were removed from the lading and earmarked for appropriate disposal. Spillage inside RDWY 280994 was cleaned and all removed non-damaged lading was returned inside RDWY 280994 properly blocked and braced for further transportation.

Lincoln cleaned the spill with floor absorb and brought out a vaccum truck with a steamer to clean the ground as well as the customers sump drains recovering all diesel that was released.,We have changed from bungees to a much stronger material velcro type strap.

So I kept the drum on the dock until we could identify why it wasn't marked correctly. Monday afternoon I looked and found out that the drum was filled with UN1405 Calcium Silicide (or Silicon), 4.3 Dangerous When Wet. I ended up putting placards on the drum and saw that there were small solid chunks of the chemical along with dust surrounding the lid of the drum. I knew there wasn't a leak in the lid because the bungholes were secured and the handle for the lid was secured. I could only assume the chemical spilled over at the shipper's warehouse. On the lid of the drum there are about 3 small pieces of solid chemical, along with dust surrounding the lid, totaling maybe 6 grams of chemical. The company that was contracted to clean up the spill was HazChem, called by ERTS (Emergency Response & Training Solutions). The company should have it cleaned by 0700 on Tuesday morning (the 16th).","The first step in the prevention process would be for the company/shipper to ensure their shipments are fully placarded, with no residual chemicals on the outside. The next step is to ensure our drivers fully examine all Hazmat shipments to make sure they are marked correctly, and the documentation is accurate, otherwise it should not be picked up. Finally, to coach all the drivers to be vigilant in making sure their Hazmat shipments are correct so that the safety of everyone involved is maintained at the highest levels.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CON-WAY FREIGHT,US,

Also, the liquid line's closure plug was identified as less than tool tight. In addition, the vapor line's pipe flange connection was identified with 1 of 4 flange bolt stud nuts being less than tool tight. These securement deficiencies were reported to local BNSF mechanical personnel whom proceeded to tool tighten these loose nuts and closure plug. Afterwards, the vapor vent ebbed but continued at the liquid line's flange connection. Contract responders identified the liquid line's pipe flange gasket as being partially torn and rolled, not sealing. The responders removed the defective flange gasket and applied Gore-Tex gasket material at the flange connection to seal the liquid line's flange connection. The flange connection was resecured and no further vapor release was detectable.

The car is a load of Petroleum Crude Oil UN1267 Class 3. All concerned were notified and responder activated.    Responder arrived onsite at 1:45pm. Completed car shop safety briefing at 1:53pm. Air quality at the car shop was assessed and found to be safe (0% LEL, 0 ppb VOC 10.6 lamp, and ND H2S color metric tube). The tracks were blue flagged at 2:10pm. Began tank car investigation at 2:15 pm. Upon arriving tank car location, responder found safe air quality at ground level breathing zone (0% LEL, 20-40 ppb VOC, and ND H2S). There was a light detectable olfactory odor. The side of the tank car had evidence of released and volatilized (dried) lading.     Upon investigation of tank car top platform, found air quality in the breathing zone safe (0% LEL, 20-60,000 ppb VOC, and ND H2S). The manway was found to be leaking and had released approximately 1.0 gallon of lading account one loose manway bolt. The manway gasket was inspected and the gasket was found to be in satisfactory condition. It was determined that the manway was probably tightened incorrectly with a pneumatic impact wrench without the proper cross pattern sequence and thus caused the manway to lift on one side and not to position correctly. Responders properly closed and secured the manway and secured it tool tight. All other closures were inspected on this car and the following defects were found and corrected: Loose sample valve secondary closure plug (no release). Unsecured vapor valve secondary closure cap (no release).     Seal 119195 was removed from the manway, and replaced with HMRI606 + HMRI977.  Seal 119196 was removed from the protective housing, and replaced with HMRI700.    The tank car was released back into transportation at 5:30pm and the car shop and transportation department were so advised.    * No injuries reported  File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.   File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non-accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

This is a downhill, winding stretch of 2 lane highway with passing lanes for uphill traffic.  According to the on board recoding device (CADEC), he was traveling 61mph moments before the rollover, then directly before it was at 58mph.  The speed limit at this location is 60mph.    Driver states after rounding a right hand bend in the hwy. he noticed the back axle of the pup leave the pavement, he tried to correct it but it continued off the pavement.  He further states he felt the steering wheel shanking as he continued to try to steer and slow down, when through the dust he saw the tongue of the draw bar separate from the lead trailer. He began to lose air for braking and was able to stop the truck 100 ft. down the road.    He got out of the cab and discovered the pup had overturned and was lying on its left side, in the downhill lane of traffic. He tried to call 911 and McRae Dispatch but his cell phone had a weak signal. A bystander continued to the top of Daniels Pass and contacted Emergency Services and McRae Dispatch. UHP and Wasatch County Sheriff's were dispatched to the scene, along with Park City Towing. D&A McRae Management responded immediately to the scene. Chevron Manager Anna Wilkins was also notified of the incident.    Upon arrival, D & A McRae personnel proceeded to off load the crude oil from the overturned pup (P13) to Truck 15. This was accomplished without incident. As a precaution, the product from the lead trailer that was part of the accident (T13) was also transferred. The load was delivered to the Chevron SLC Refinery that evening. Truck 10 and T13 were inspected on scene by the Roosevelt Shop Manager to ensure the units were road worthy.  It was driven fron the scene back to the Roosevelt Terminal. P13 was towed from the scene. No crude oil was spilled as a result of the overturn or from the transfer of the product.","Observations on drivers will be re-doubled with continued focus on new drivers, driving skills, good decision making and recognizing risk.

The MSDS and other documentation with the shipment specifically stated the product was a “Heat Transfer Fluid” identified as Dimethylphthalate and was not regulated per the IATA regulations.  The shipment was placed into a steel metal drum and set up for disposal.  The disposal team arrived to transfer the shipment to their facility for disposal.  When the shipment was removed from the steel drum, it immediately began smoking.  The disposal team contacted the intended receiver and was told the true identity of the product was Titanium Chloride, a regulated substance that must be kept cool to prevent from smoking.

While moving the tote into the trailer, the employee accidentally steered the tote into a metal clamping mechanism that's attached to the back side wall entry way of the trailer.  The metal clamp punctured the side wall of the tote spilling an estimated 20 gallons of material.    The puncture in the tote was located in the lower side of the tote.  The release lasted approximately two hours.  Fifteen minutes after the tote was punctured it was placed on top of a poly containment system which contained the remaining material that leaked from the tote.    The material that leaked was cleaned up and sent to a proper waste disposal facility.  The material in the poly containment system was transferred into a new tote for disposal.  The punctured tote was sent to a proper waste disposal facility.","Veolia employees at Schenectady, NY were trained to bungee the metal clamp against the side wall of the trailer.  This will eliminate the clamp from protruding outward and being able to puncture any containers.

The Veolia driver donned a respirator and protective clothing and entered the truck to determine the source of the odor.  The Veolia driver observed an 85 gallon plastic drum that was emitting red vapors from the edges of the screw top lid.  The outer drum contained 20x1 gallon(half full) containers of corrosive liquids.  Approximately 3 of the 1 gallon inner containers were found to be damaged.  The Veolia driver enacted the Veolia emergency response plan.  A response team was dispatched to the site and using level B personal protective equipment, entered the truck and stabilized the salvage drum using dry inorganic absorbent.  The response team noted that there was also some cardboard and other material in the outer drum that was likely the source of the reaction with the corrosive materials.  The drum was monitored for several hours to ensure that no further reaction occurred. No liquid or solid material was released from the contaienr during the incident.  The container was then transported by Veolia to the Veolia Port Arthur incineration facility for treatment and disposal.",The Veolia driver and Veolia sales and customer service had knowledge that this drum contained material that was damaged and had a history of problems at the shippers facility.

While entering parking lot at Ace Hardware in Cary, North Carolina, it appears the freight shifted and punctured one (1) 300-gallon tote of caustic soda 50%, being shipped as sodium hydroxide solution. As a result, approximately 250 gallons of free product released to the trailer floor and asphalt parking lot. Gary Fire Department responded to assess the site, and proceeded to wash the parking lot with excessive amounts of water. As a result, free product and water affected the asphalt parking lot entrance, around to back of store, and impacted outside pallets and debris being held outside the hardware store. Environmental Restoration and Hepaco were dispatched to perform the cleanup. Upon arrival on site, absorbent material was applied to the affected area, in an effort to contain. Due to the large area of impact, as a result of the fire department water placement, a vacuum truck was dispatched to recover free liquids from the lot. Environmental Restoration and Hepaco personnel proceeded to recover free product and wash waters from the parking lot, while neutralizing the caustic material. Once the parking lot was secure, Hepaco, Inc. proceeded to offload trailer, clean impacted trailer floor and surrounding areas, and containerize remaining free product. Freight was loaded onto a recovery trailer provided by Wilson Trucking Corporation, to be sent on to its destination. Following a rain event in the area, Hepaco returned to the site, collected residual product, and site was deemed for closure. Disposal was coordinated in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.

He changed lanes to the left lane to pass a slower moving truck (Transfreight) in the right lane as as he was 3/4 completed with the pass, the Transfreight Driver proceeded to move his truck into the left lane, striking the Air Liquide transport on the passenger side and forcing him off the road into the highway median on his left and causing the transport to rollover. The inner vessel of the trailer was intact, however gaseous nitrogen needed to be vented out of the road relief valve to reduce the weight of the transport so the wrecker (Glenn's Wrecker Service)could bring the transport upright and tow from the scene. The AL driver was transported to Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga via ambulance to be evaluated and he received minor injuries from the accident. Trooper Terrence Gann of the TN Highway patrol and Steve Lamb from the Marion County EMA were on the scene to manage the incident.",The vehicle accident / rollover was caused by the Transfreight Driver and he was cited for failure to maintain lane and due care.

The driver of the truck had stopped his vehicle on the county road while waiting in line to enter the facility. He took this as an opportunity to loosen the tarp of the roll-off container to expedite opening the tarp once he arrived at the facility sample rack. When he loosened the tarp, the roll-off container began to leak from the bottom seal of the tail-gate. It has not been determined why loosening the tarp would cause or if it could cause such a leak to occur. The driver stated that he made no other adjustments to any other closures of the container. The spill was along a length of the county road approximately 200 feet south of entrance to Heritage Environmental Services, LLC and from the facility entrance to the facility scale. Heritage believes there were no actual or potential hazards to the environment or the human health outside the facility. This determination is based on a review of the waste analysis and samples collected following clean up actions.","The driver has been instructed to not make any unwarranted adjustments to containers and closures during transport, especially outside of designated loading and unloading areas or sampling areas.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7180,"HERTIAGE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, LLC",US,

STEVE SCHROEDER) HAD REPORTED THAT HE HAD DISCOVERED A LIQUID MATERIAL LEAKING FROM A CONTAINER(S) THAT WAS BEING TRANSPORTED ON A TRAILER (FLATBET). MR. LONSDALE INFORMED MR. BELTRAN THAT ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMSERS, PCB WASTE IN DRUMS, AND OTHER PCB ITEMS WERE BEING TRANSPORTED. THE TRACTOR-TRAILER UNIT WAS LOCATED IN THE PARKING LOT OF SAPP BROTHERS TRUCK STOP LOCATED AT 380 ODESSA ROAD IN ELM CREEK, NEBRASKA. MR. LONSDALE REQUESTED THAT EMI COORDINATE A RESPONSE TO THE RELEASE. MR. BELTRAN CONTACTED MR. SCHROEDER FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. MR. SCHROEDER STATED THAT A TRANSFORMER OR TRANSFORMERS WERE BELIEVED TO BE LEAKING. THE ITEMS WERE LOCATED IN A CONTAINMENT AREA ON THE TRAILER. SOME OF THE LIQUID HAD SPILLED OUT OF THE CONTAINMENT AND IMPACTED THE PARKING LOT (SOIL). NO STORM DRAINS OR NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS WERE IMPACTED. MR. SCHROEDER HAS DEPLOYED ABSORBENT MATERIALS TO CONTAIN THE RELEASE. MR. BELTRAN CONTACTED HAZ-MAT RESPONSE, INC. (HMR), AN EMI APPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL SUBCONTRACTOR. MR. BELTRAN SPOKE WITH MR. JOSH SUMMERS AND REQUESTED THAT HMRI RESPOND TO THE RELEASE ON BEHALF OF EMI. MR. SUMMERS STATED THAT HE WOULD ASSEMBLE A RESPONSE TEM AND EQUIPMENT AND MOBILIZE TO THE SITE. HMRI ARRIVED ON SITE AND LOCATED THE UNIT. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE LIQUID HAD IMPACTED THE SOIL ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TRAILER. THE IMPACTED AREA WAS APPROXIMATELY 53 FEET LONG AND 12 FEET IN WIDTH. MR. SAM SMITH (SST) ALSO ARRIVED ONSITE. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT A SMALL INSULATOR LOCATED NEAR THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THE TRANSFORMERS HAD BROKEN, CAUSING THE RELEASE. THE TRANSFORMER HAD BEEN SECURED WITH STRAPS BUT HAD SHIFTED AND STRUCK ANOTHER TRANSFORMER CAUSING THE SMALL INSULATOR TO BREAK. APPROXIMATELY 70 TO 80 GALLONS OF LIQUID (68PPM) HAD BEEN RELEASED FROM THE TRANSFORMER (S/N 67B9560). HMRI PERSONNEL THEN DRAINED THE REMAINING LIQUID (APPROXIMATELY 55-GALLONS) INTO A DRUM. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE LIQUID HAD ALSO BREACHED THE CONTAINMENT AREA AND IMPACTED THE WOOD DECKING OF THE TRAILER FLOOR. AFTER A DISCUSSION BETWEEN MR. SMITH AND MR. SUMMERS, IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE LIQUID FROM THE REMAINING TWO TRANSFORMERS (NOT LEAKING AT THAT TIME) WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO DRUMS. ALL CONTAINERS ON THE TRAILER WOULD THEN BE LOADED INTO ROLL-OFF BOXES WITH ABSORBENTS TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER RELEASES WHILE IN TRANSPORT.

The fire damaged or destroyed the vast majority of the 20 lb tanks in the storage yard, along with several tractors, trailers and two forklifts.

He observed that the environmental containment bucket was full so he hooked up his hose to the facility and removed crude from the containment bucket through the 1"" piping. Afterwards the driver was ready to unload his crude into the facility and failed to reverse his pump thinking he had done so already. The driver then left his truck (in load operation) to go fill out his paperwork and due to heavy rain the log in the mailbox was soaked and unuseable. Driver went inside the location's office to retreive another log. When he returned to his truck (according to driver 2-3 minutes after walking away) approximately 10 bbls. of crude had overloaded out of his truck onto the ground below.     Along with improper unloading procedure a check valve in place at the facility failed causing crude to be unloaded from the tank battery and loaded onto the truck.     Overfill caused crude to be released onto location covering an area of approximately 40x20 yards with 40% coverage.  Heavy rains prior and during incident carried spilled crude  off of location into neighboring land to the Southwest. Neighboring land received crude carried by rainwater and covered a downhill slope leading up to the Big Spring facility as well as 1270ft. into a waterway leading out towards Beals Creek. Spill was contained to the waterway and did not reach Beals Creek (approximately 500 ft. further downstream).",Berm walls will be added to Southwest edge of location to help prevent potential future releases from leaving the facility into neighboring land.    All check valves/ball valves will be replaced on the central battery facility to help prevent future failure.

Ana Ortiz to respond to an alarm on an item found in the check bag of passenger Anderson Novalin, tag bag #19-13-78.  The bag was in transit from Port Au Prince Haiti to Baltimore Maryland.  The bag was in the process of being screened  inside the TSA West room when the incident began.   Ana determined that the bag had a foul smell and an unknown substance had spilled inside the bag.  Ana did not remove the item and contact AA Compliance Coordinator, Carolann Rodriguez.  At 1450 the CC responded and located the bag outside the TSA West screening room on the ramp between D24/D25.    An AA Environmental Coordinator was contacted.  In addition the passenger was called at the departure gate to gather information as to the contents of his bag.  The TSA contacted the Metro Dade Fire Rescue and Hazmat Team.  They reponded at app. 1520 and contained the area.  The liquid in the bag was tested by the Metro Dade Hazmat team and reported to be Malathion a toxic pesticide, by Chief Williams.   The Incident began app 1450 and concluded about 1750.",This case is currently under investigation by the FAA/DOT.
