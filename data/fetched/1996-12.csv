THE N&M TRANSFER DRIVER INVOLVED IN THIS SPILL WAS ASSIGNED TO PICK UP THIS TRAILER(#908944) FROM BEMIS INC., OSHKOSH, WI.  NOTIFICATION OF THE SPILL CAME AFTER A DOCK EMPLOYEE FROM CURWOOD, INC.

WE DISPATCHED TWO OF OUR SUPERVISORS (HAZMAT TECHNICIANS) TO THE SITE WITH FULL HAZARDOUS RESPONSE GEAR AND CLEAN UP MATERIALS. CLEAN UP WAS DELAYED UNTIL A DRIVER COULD BE DISPATCHED TO CURWOOD TO REMOVE THE TRAILER A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DOCK.  AFTER THE INK WAS REMOVED FROM THE TRAILER FLOOR AN N&M DRIVER WAS DISPATCHED FROM OUR NEENAH TERMINAL TO BRING THE TRAILER BACK TO N&M TRANSFER.  SOME FURTHER CLEAN UP WAS DONE AT N&M TRANSFER.  SHORTLY AFTER THAT THE TRAILER WAS SENT TO A LICENSED TANK WASH FACILITY FOR COMPLETE DECONTAMINATION.

THE TRACTOR/TRAILER TRANSPORTING THE FREIGHT WAS INVOLVED IN A ACCIDENT ON DECEMBER 3. THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF INCLEMENT WEATHER AND SLICK ROADS. THE VEHICLE WAS TRAVELING EAST BOUND ON I-84, WHEN THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL ON A CURVE DUE TO ICY ROADS, WENT THROUGH A GUARD RAIL AND DOWN A SLIGHT EMBANKMENT. THE VEHICLE CAME TO REST ON ITS SIDE NOT FAR FROM THE BURNT RIVER. THERE WERE NOT ANY INJURIES. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE FREIGHT WAS HAZARDOUS MATERIAL, THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL WAS NOT A MAJOR FACTOR. THE PROBLEM WAS THE FUEL AND OIL, WHICH WAS RELEASED FROM THE TRACTORS FUEL TANKS AND OIL PAN AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT.APPROXIMATELY 100 TO 150 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL WAS RELEASED FROM THE TRACTORS FUEL TANKS AND APPROXIMATELY 10 GALLONS OF OIL WAS RELEASED FROM THE TRACTORS OIL PAN. INITIALLY, THE FUEL AND OIL WAS RELEASED ONTO THE GROUND AS WELL AS A SMALL QUANTITY (5 GALLONS) OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. HOWEVER, THE NEXT DAY IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT SOME OF THE FUEL AND OIL HAD MIGRATED INTO THE RIVER. SEA CURTAINS AND BOOMS HAD TO BE PLACED IN THE RIVER TO CONTAIN AND ABSORB THE FUEL AND OIL. THE SOIL WHICH WAS CONTAMINATED BY THE FUEL, OIL AND HAZARDOUS MATERIAL WAS REMOVED AND WILL BE DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS.

ON DECEMBER 31, 1996, AN ETHYLENE OXIDE RAILCAR BECAME OVER PRESSURIZED AND THE RELIEF VALVE OPENED VENTING ETHYLENE OXIDE AND NITROGEN TO THE ATMOSPHERE.  AN OPERATOR WENT TO THE RAILCAR AND CLOSED OFF  THE NITROGEN VALVE WHICH WAS CONNECTED TO THE RAILCAR. HE ALSO ATTEMPTED TO VENT THE PRESSURE (WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 80 PSIA) TO THE SCRUBBER HOWEVER, SINCE THE VENT LINE IS ONLY 1/2"", THE RELIEF VALVE CONTINUED TO VENT.  THE PROCESS MANAGER ATTEMPTED TO TRANSFER OXIDE TO AN EMPTY PREWEIGH TANK BUT SINCE THE MANUAL VALVE ON THE CAR WAS NOT OPEN, NO OXIDE WAS TRANSFERRED.  THE RELIEF VALVE RESEATED UPON REACHING 71 PSIA AND THE INCIDENT WAS OVER.  THE INCIDENT OCCURRED BETWEEN 7:15 PM AND 8:15 PM.  USING THE IDEAL GAS LAW AND PARTIAL PRESSURES, WE ESTIMATE THAT 17.2 POUNDS OF ETHYLENE OXIDE WAS RELEASED ALONG WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE NITROGEN. THESE HAND WRITTEN CALCULATIONS ARE ENCLOSED.  OUR INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE NITROGEN REGULATOR WHICH REDUCES THE PRESSURE AT THE RAILCARS TO 55 PSIA HAD FAILED.  THIS REGULATOR WAS REPLACED ALONG WITH THE PRESSURES GAUGES.  THE GAUGE WHICH OUR OPERATOR SAID WAS 80 PSIA AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WAS FOUND TO BE INACCURATE AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL PRESSURE WAS AT THE RAILCAR.  WE KNOW THAT THE RAILCAR RELIEF VALVE IS SET TO RELIEVE AT 75 PSIA.  WE ALSO HAD A THOROUGH INSPECTION OF OUR PRAXAIR NITROGEN SYSTEM AT WHICH TIME THE REGULATORS WERE CALIBRATED AND VARIOUS GAUGES WERE REPLACED.  THE TECHNICIAN CONCLUDED THAT THE MAXIMUM LINE PRESSURE DELIVERED TO THE SYSTEM COULD NOT HAVE EXCEEDED 78 PSIA AND THAT WAS ONLY IF THEIR REGULATOR HAD FAILED ALSO.  WE CONTINUED TO USE THE CAR THROUGH THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND MONITORED THE AREA TO VERIFY THAT THE RELIEF VALVE HAD PROPERLY RESEATED. THE RAILCAR WAS INSPECTED AT THE SHELL FACILITY ON JANUARY 24, 1997. THEY PRESSURE TESTED THE RELIEF VALVE AND VERIFIED THAT THE RELIEF VALVE HAD LIFTED AND THAT IT RESEATED AT 71 PSIA.TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A REOCCURRENCE THE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE FOR THE RAILCAR REGULATORS HAS BEEN REVIEWED.
