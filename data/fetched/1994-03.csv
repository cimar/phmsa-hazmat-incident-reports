HE REPORTED THAT LIQUID MATERIAL WAS LEAKING FROM THE PORTABLE TANK HE HAD PICKED UP IN NEENAH.  HE WAS CALLING FROM THE CONSIGNEE'S DOCK IN GREEN BAY TO INFORM US THAT THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE SHIPMENT.  OUR DRIVER WAS INSTRUCTED TO BRING THE RUPTURED PORTABLE TANK BACK TO THE N&M TRANSFER TERMINAL IN NEENAH.  WHEN THE DRIVER ARRIVED HE HAD LOST APPROXIMATELY 5-10 GALLONS OF THE ADHESIVE MATERIAL IN HIS TRAILER.  THE N&M TRANSFER SAFETY OFFICE CONTACTED THE SHIPPER FOR A MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET PRIOR TO CLEANING THE TRAILER.  I ALSO CONTACTED A MANUFACTIRER OF CARDBOARD PORTABLE TANKS SIMILAR TO THIS ONE, REQUESTING INFORMATION ON HOW TO STOP THE LEAK.  THEY WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION THAT WAS USEFUL. OUR DOCK SUPERVISORS VERIFIED THE FACT THAT THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE VALVE AREA, WHERE THE PLASTIC LINER IS SEALED TO THE HARD PLASTIC VALVE.  I BELIEVE THERE ARE TWO POSSIBILITIES REGARDING THE CAUSE OF THEIS SPILL 1. THE SEAL AROUND THE PLASTIC VALVE BROKE LOOSE, CAUSING THE RUPTURE. 2. THE TOWMOTOR OPERATOR (AT WSI NEENAH) SOMEHOW HIT THE VALVE OF THE TANK AGAINST THE FRONT WALL OF THE TRAILER, CAUSING A TEAR IN THE PLASTIC LINER THAT CONNECTS TO THE VALVE. WE WERE UNABLE TO STOP THE LEAK AT OUR NEENAH FACILITY, SO WE ALLOWED ALL 300 GALLONS TO DRAIN IN TO SALVAGE DRUMS.  IT IS OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT STRONGER PERFORMANCE STANDARDS BE INTROUDUCED REGARDING CARDBOARD PORTABLE TANKS.  I ALSO SUGGEST THAT SHIPPERS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO SHIP THESE TYPES OF TANKS WITH VALVES PRE-INSERTED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK.

THE CARGO VAN CONTAINED 73.4 T.I. ON MARCH 6, 1994, A FREAK SNOWSTORM CAUSING ""WHITEOUT"" CONDITIONS ON THE ROAD WITH SUBSEQUENT ICING AT THE MOUNTAINTOP LOCATION. THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE INITIATED THE DEL-MED, INC. EMERGENCY PLAN BY NOTIFICATION OF HIS DISPATCHER USING THE CELLULAR PHONE OF A PASSING VEHICLE. INITIAL RESPONDENTS AT THE SITE WERE THE PA STATE POLICE FROM SWIFTWATER TROOP ""S"", A DEL-MED, INC. SUPERVISOR AND THE MONROE COUNTY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM. THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES BUREAU OF RADIATION PROTECTION (PA DER/BRP) WAS ALSO ALERTED TO THE SCENE. THE ROAD WAS CLOSED AT APPROXIMATELY 1900 THAT EVENING BY THE STATE POLICE ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS WAS DONE AS A RESULT OF INVOLVEMENT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL OR FROM GENERALLY IMPASSABLE ROAD CONDITIONS. INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE ACCIDENT SCENE BY THE MONROE COUNTY RESPONDERS WAS THAT NONE OF THE FREIGHT  HAD LEFT THE VEHICLE. THIS GROUP ALLOWED THE RIGHTING OF THE VEHICLE AND ITS SUBSEQUENT TOWING TO THE NEARBY OFF RAMP. THE HIGHWAY WAS REOPENED BY THE PA STATE POLICE AT APPROXIMATELY 2130 HOURS. THE ARRIVAL OF THE DEL-MED SUPERVISOR ALLOWED A COMMUNICATIONS LINK WITH THE SCENE VIA HIS CELLULAR PHONE. THE SUPERVISOR ARRIVED AT THE SCENE PRIOR TO THE AMBULANCE AND THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE PA DER/BRP. THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE STATED TO HIS SUPERVISOR THAT HE DID NOT BELEIVE HE HAD BEEN INJURED IN THE MISHAP, HOWEVER HE WAS TAKEN TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL EQUIPPED FOR RADIATION ACCIDENTS AFTER TURNING OVER CUSTODY OF THE SHIPMENT TO HIS SUPERVISOR. THE DISARRAYED CONFIGURATION OF THE FREIGHT AT THE TIME OF ARRIVAL OF THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE PA DER/BRP (MR. BOB LEWIS) DID NOT PRESENT REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL HAD BEEN RELEASED FROM THE PACKAGES. THE INITIAL EXPOSURE RATE MEASURED BY LEWIS ON THE FREIGHT ACCESSIBLE FROM THE SMALL BROKEN WINDOW IN THE REAR DOOR OF THE CARGO VAN WAS BETWEEN 400 AND 500 MR/HR. THE DEL-MED, INC. RADIATION SAFETY OFFICER WAS CONSULTED ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS READING USING THE CELLULAR PHONE LINK PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE VAN DOORS. THE DEL-MED, INC. RADIATION SAFETY OFFICER ADVISED MR. LEWIS THAT SUCH A RADIATION LEVEL WAS NOT UNEXPECTED IF THE PACKAGES WERE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER. SUCH MEASUREMENTS HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN RECORDED IN THE ASSESSMENT OF EXPOSURE RATES IN THE DEL-MED, INC. WAREHOUSE ON PALETTED GENERATORS. A PLAN TO TRANSFER THE PACKAGES FROM THE DAMAGED VEHICLE INTO THE BACK-UP VEHICLE WAS IMPLEMENTED. MR. LEWIS WAS ADVISED TO OBSERVED EACH PACKAGE FOR SIGNS OF SEVERE DAMAGE PENETRATING BEYOND THE OUTER LAYERS OF THE PACKAGING. SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS TO BE GIVEN TO ANY SEVERELY DAMAGED PACKAGES INCLUDING PRECAUTIONS FOR CONTAMINATION CONTROL.

THE DRIVER OVER REACTED AND CAUSED THE TRUCK TO LEAVE THE ROAD. UPON LEAVING THE ROAD THE TRUCK TRAVEL A SHORT DISTANCE IN DENNIS FUEGER CORN FIELD. WHILE TRAVELING ALONG PARALLEL TO ROAD THE TRUCK FRONT BUMPER DUG INTO THE ROAD BANK CAUSING THE REAR OF THE TRUCK TO SWING SOUTH INITIATING THE ROLE OVER. THE TRUCK ROLLED OVER TWO AND A HALF TIMES. THE COVERS ON THE TANK STAYED IN TACK. ONE COVER WAS DRIPPING. IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK A VENT PIPE BROKE CAUSING AND ADDITIONAL LEAK. THE PRODUCT THAT LEAKED WAS DIESEL FUEL. AT THE SIGHT, THERE WAS NO ROAD DITCH. THE TRUCK RAN OFF THE ROAD AT A POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS UP HILL FROM WHERE THE TRUCK ENDED. THERE WAS A SLIGHT SLOPE TO THE SOUTH. UPON NOTIFICATION OF THE ACCIDENT THE FIRST EMPLOYEES AT THE SCENE DUG A SMALL DIKE DOWN SLOPE FROM THE FUEL TRUCK. BUCKETS AND ABSORBENT PADS WERE PUT TO USE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY TO CONTROL OR STOP THE LEAKS. APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES OUR COMPANIES HAZARDOUS MATERIAL TRAILER ARRIVE WITH EQUIPMENT AND SPHAGSORB. THIS PRODUCT WILL ONLY ABSORB HYDROCARBONS AND NOT WATER. THIS PRODUCT WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE FUEL ON THE GROUND. ON THIS DAY THE SURFACE WATER WAS EXTREMELY HIGH AND ON THE SURFACE. THIS PREVENTED THE FUEL FROM GOING INTO THE SOIL AND THIS FACT MADE CLEAN UP RELATIVELY EASY. THE SPHAGSORB WAS APPLIED TO THE SPILLED PRODUCT WHEN AN AREA BECAME SOAKED MORE WAS APPLIED UNTIL THE ALL OF THE PRODUCT WAS ABSORBED. THE WRECKER PEOPLE (DALLAS TOWING) ARRIVED AND COMMENCED TO RIGHT THE TRUCK. AFTER THE TRUCK WAS RIGHTED AND MOVE BACK ON TO HARD SURFACE THE REST OF THE FUEL IN THE TRUCK WAS PUMPED OFF SHOWING A LOSS OF ABOUT 75 GALLONS. APPROXIMATELY THIRTY OF THESE GALLONS WAS CAUGHT IN FIVE GALLON BUCKETS AND DID NOT REACHED THE SOIL. A BACKHOE OPERATOR JIM TULLEY WAS THEN CALLED AND THE SOIL CLEANUP WAS STARTED. APPROXIMATELY TWO INCHES OF SOIL WAS REMOVED OVER 2700 SQUARE FEET. WE REMOVED THIS AMOUNT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD ALL OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL. THE ACTUAL SPILL ONLY COVERED APPROXIMATELY 900 SQUARE FEET. AT THIS POINT THE SOIL WAS TAKEN TO SPENCER COUNTY FARM BUREAU COOP PLANT SIGHT, IN CHRISNEY INDIANA. THE SOIL WAS THEN STORED ON PLASTIC AND COVER WITH PLASTIC WITH A SMALL BERM AROUND THE PILE. REPORTING: THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS CALLED AROUND NOON AND THE INCIDENT NUMBER IS 229498. IDEM WAS CALLED HOWEVER THE LOCAL SHERIFF HAD ALREADY REPORT THE SPILL. I TALKED TO MARK MAULK ABOUT THE SPILL AND RELATED THE FACTS AS I KNEW THEM AT THE TIME AROUND NOON SPENCER COUNTY TIME. MARK ASK THAT I CALL LATER IN THE DAY AND REPORT ON THE DISPOSITION OF THE SPILL. I RETURN THE CALL WITH CHRIS ROGERS PRESENT AT 4:15 AND I TALKED TO PAULA EGNER.

ALABAMA INVOLVING THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID 31% ON TUESDAY, MARCH 8, 1994.  THE COORDINATES OF THE FACILITY ARE APPROXIMATELY NORTH 33 DEGREE 31'-1.42"" AND WEST 86 DEGREE 52'-13.02"".  THE INITIAL REPORT OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT IS ASSUMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE BY A SECURITY GUARD FROM ANOTHER BUSINESS IN THE AREA AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30PM.  THE FAILITY MANAGER, JOHNNY RECTOR RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AT 9:40PM.  HE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 10:10PM, ASSESSED THE SITUATION AND INITATED CALLS TO OTHER PERSONNEL WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION FOR RESPONDED AND CLEAN-UP ACTIVITIES.  THE INCIDENT CONCLUDED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30AM.  WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE WERE NO RAIN, HIGH SCATTERED CLOUDS, TEMPERATURE 54 DEGREES, BAROMETRIC PRESSURE 29.96 AND THE WIND WAS FROM THE NORTHEAST AT 10MPH.  UPON ARRIVAL, MR. RECTOR OBSERVED RESPONSE UNITS FROM STATION 16, 18 AND A HOOK AND LADDER UNIT POSSIBLY FROM STATION 20. THE ENSLEY PRECINCT DISPATCHED SERVERAL UNITS TO THE INTERSECTIONS OF 13TH STREET AND AVENUE V AND BROCK INDUSTIAL DRIVE AND AN UNNAMED SERVICE ROAD TO THE NORTH OF 13TH STREET.  ANOTHER POLICE UNIT WAS OBSERVED AT ANNISTON AVENUE WHICH IS A RESIDENTIAL AREA APPROXIMATELY 1180 FEET FROM THE SITE. ALL UNITS WERE PLACED ON STAND-BY AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE FACILITY UNTIL THE PROBLEM WAS DETERMINED AND RESOLVED.  INITIALLY, THE EVACUATION OF THE HOMES ALONG 15TH STREET, ADJACENT TO AND SOUTH OF 13TH STREET WAS ORDERED,  SHORLTY THEREAFTER, WHEN THE STRENGTH OF THE HYDROCHLORIC WAS DETERMINED, THE EVACUATION WAS TERMINATED.  THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE OCCURED FROM A PORTABLE TOTE TANK WITH A 320 GALLON CAPACITY. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 120 TO 130 GALLONS OR 1250 POUNDS WERE RECOVERED FROM THE AREA OF THE SPILL.  SOME OF THE PRODUCT FROM THE LEAKING TANK WAS INITALLY TRANSFERRED TO PLASTIC BUCKETS AND THEN INTO A DRUM.  THE TANK WAS THEN TURNED ON ITS SIDE TO STOP THE PRODUCT FROM ESCAPING THEN TAKING TO A CONTAINMENT AREA FOR TRANSFER TO DRUMS.  THE HYDROCHLORIC WAS CONTAINED AND NEUTRALIZED USING SODIUM CARBONATE.  ONCE ALL THE ACID WAS NEUTRALIZED BY THE SODIUM CARBONATE IT WAS TRANSFERRED TO DRUMS AND MOVED TO AN AREA PROTECTED FROM THE WEATHER,  THE AREA OF THE SPILL WAS AGAIN SCRAPED AND SWEPT TO REMOVE ANY REMAINING RESIDUE.  NO PRODUCT FROM THE RELEASE ENTERED SURFACE DRAINS.  WE SUSPECT THAT THE LEAK IN THE PORTABLE TANK WAS CAUSED BY THE INSTALLATION OF AN INCOMPATIBLE FITTING.  THE TANK WAS INSPECTED ON MONDAY, MARCH 7TH AND FOUND TO HAVE A DEFECTIVE VALVE ASSEMBLY.  A NEW VALVE ASSEMBLY INCLUDING THE DEFECTIVE 3"" NIPPLE WAS INSTALLED.  THIS 3"" NIPPLE WAS APPARENTLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE ACID AND FOUND TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY DETERIORATED.  THE FITTING, MADE OF VINYL, HAD NO DISTINGUISHABLE MARKS TO DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM OTHER PVC FITTINGS.

INSPECTION BY ROBINSON REVEALED THAT A SMALL AMOUNT OF LIQUID AMMONIA WAS LEAKING FROM BENEATH THE PACKING GLAND RETAINER OF THE ""B"" END LIQUID VALVE. ROBINSON WAS ABLE TO TIGHTEN THE TWO MACHINE SCREWS HOLDING THE RETAINER AND THIS STOPPED THE LEAKAGE.

DUE TO SOME CONFUSION REGARDING THE FACT THAT AMPRO FERTILIZER HAD LOADED THE CAR, WHILE FIRST MISSISSIPPI WAS LISTED AS THE SHIPPER, THE CHEMTREC NOTIFICATION BY SPRINGER DID NOT RESULT IN A RESPONSE BY AMPRO OR FIRST MISSISSIPPI TO THE SCENE. ROBINSON DID TELEPHONE MR. STEVE MISTRETTA, MANAGER OF SECURITY & SAFETY FOR THE JOINT FACILITY OF AMPRO AND TRIAD CHEMICALS AT DONALDSONVILLE.

REMAC DISCOVERED 41, 5 GALLON CANS LEAKING OR DAMAGED TO THE POINT THAT THEY REQUIRED OVERPACKING. THE LEAKAGE WAS CAUSED BY POOR QUALITY CONTAINERS AND IMPROPER  PREPARATION BY THE SHIPPER FOR TRANSPORTATION. IN ADDITION, THE LOAD WAS IMPROPERLY BLOCKED AND BRACED BY THE DRIVER. THE METAL CANS WERE STACKED 3 HIGH WITH APPROXIMATELY 31 TO A PALLET. THE CANS WERE SHRINK WRAPPED TOGETHER AND TAPED. AS THE TRUCK TRAVELED DOWN THE ROAD, THE SHRINK WRAPPING FAILED ALLOWING THE CANS TO ROLL FREE. SOME OF THE CANS WERE CRUSHED WHILE OTHERS HAD LOOSE FITTING CLOSURES WHICH ALLOWED THE RELEASE OF MATERIAL. IT IS MY OPINION THAT SHRINK WRAPPING IS NOT AND EFFECTIVE MEANS OF SECURING CARGO THAT HAS ANY WEIGHT TO IT.
