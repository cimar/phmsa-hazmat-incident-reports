The car was isolated, the shipper was notified via CHEMTREC (Report # 2010-02-02-00028), TOBIN.HOLZHUTER@LYONDELL.COM, and the local 911 was notified. SPSI, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene to inspect and secure the car. McCulley Eastham and Associates, was dispatched to the scene to perform air monitoring. SPSI personnel discovered old packing material between the ball valve and the ball valve seat which allowed product release beyond the ball valve. The old packing material was removed from the ball valve, the plug was reinstalled, and the leak stopped. An FRA movement approval was requested by the shipper and granted to move the car back to Tuscola, IL (Number FRA-10020072).    This incident did require several switching moves in the yard to gain access to the car by contractors.            A QA-7.1 Nonconformance Report will be submitted for this incident.

Cars destined for Exxon-Mobil were located on Track #10 in the yard. This is the serving yard for that customer.    After inspecting numerous cars in the yard, with Conrail Trainmaster H. Nagel, Exxon-Mobil (consignee) representative R. Young, and 2 representatives of REACT (environmental and emergency response contractor for Conrail), CR's Risk Manager A. Richter noted tank car TILX 191063, load Corrosive Liquid, Acidic, Organic, NOS (Isopentanoic Acid), Class 8, UN 3265, PG III, very slight seeping in and around the bottom outlet valve operating handle's stem packing.      Attempts to secure the packing by tightening the 2-nut arrangement on the packing gland proved unsuccessful.   As the release was merely weeping/seeping and no evidence was noted on the ground under the valve, it was decided to wrap the packing nut with chemical absorbent pads and secure them to the area.  Arrangements were made to switch the car into the plant at the next available switch (following day, Tuesday, February 16), which was accomplished.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Consolidated Rail Corporation,US,

The lid on one of the gallon cans dented and popped open slightly, releasing the paint into the overpack ctn and onto the floor. The leaking ctn was quickly placed into a plastic bag and loaded into a plastic 5 gallon pail. The small spill on the floor was cleaned up with paper towels and also placed into the 5 gallon pail.",Load all HM shipments secured with dunnage and in plain sight.

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders were notified and immediately inspected GETX 3108. The responders reported intact valve housing seal numbered 168767 was removed for valve inspection. The two inch liquid line valve stem was observed as the leak source. The valve handle was in the closed position, but it was loose on the valve stem. Under the handle, the valve stem packing retainer nut was found to be finger loose which was the cause of the product leak. Once the valve stem packing retainer nut was tool tightened, the product leak ceased. The valve handle was reapplied and properly tool tightened on the valve stem. The valve housing was resealed with seal BNSF 06157912. Spillage evaporated. Also, GETX 3108 had four UN1170 placards applied and these were removed since they didn't match the commodity billing received from the shipper. These were replaced by the proper UN3065 placards. No further product release was reported from GETX 3108 during subsequent movements in the railyard.  The side specification stencil on GETX 3108 indicated that the last tank qualification was completed in the year 2000 and next due in 2010.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Both he and the customer agree that the tank has enough room to hold all the product.  The tank we were unloading in to was inside the building and his truck/trailer were outside.  The driver had 4622 gallons to unload.  The customers tank has a 5000 gallon capacity with 1 foot currently in the tank and the tank is 10 feet high.  This should have eqauted to 500 gallons for a starting amount in the tank.  The driver admits he did not physically calculate how much capacity the tank could hold.  Had he done this it would have been clear that the tank could not hold the entire contents of our trailer but should not have eqauted to the 1237 gallons that actually spilled.  It should have been more like 122 gallons plus some extra because of the force of air pressure.      The driver started to offload and checked the customers tank 3 times during the unload.  The third time the customers tank level reflected 4500 gallons.  He quickly went back to the truck and was waiting for the hoses to go empty (at this time he had 25 psi on the trailer and valves open all the way) but then instead he felt a bunch of back pressure and immediately shut down.  He went in to the building and product was coming out of a drain hose (attached to the top of the tank) which empties into a containment area. We later learned that the customer said the actual starting tank level was 692 gallons instead of 500 which helps identify where some additional spillage came from.  Should have been 314-350 gallons that spilled now.  The plant did have an adjoined tank for this product and it was empty but the eqaulizer valve was not open.  Their overflow warning system failed to operate until 1.5 hours afterwards.  We checked with the shipper and the scale tickets and the weights all appear to be in the amount requested.  When the driver checked for residual product he still had 62 gallons left in his trailer.  The customer said they verified the capacity on the tank is accurate.  We do know that the site glass was replaced on the tank recently.  The only logical conclusion we could come to is that the site glass was vapor locked and not reflecting accurately (ex - 1 foot was actually 2 feet).  I state this is the reason as the fill line was connected to the tank at the bottom.  Even if it was just high air pressure going into the tank when it was at the overflow level (which the overflow drain line was also connected at the very top) it would not have caused this significant of an overflow.  Typically there will be a 20 gallon or less spill.       Reason Summations:  1. Driver did not do any calculations prior to delivery - did not back down pressure or product flow at the end of his delivery like we train our drivers to do.    2. Customer overflow alarm did not work correctly  3. Presumably a site gauge issue on the customer tank,1. Driver was brought in for Performance Enhancement Training to review the key area's he could have prevented this incident  *Verify capacities and amounts prior to unloading  *If the tank is not visible request someone from the plant to monitor the tank and communicate via walkie talkie's  *Reduce air pressure and cut back valve flow    2. Customer corrections:  *fix the overflow alarm system  *monitor site glass on next delivery - currently they do not believe this was an issue.    *open adjoining fill line to secondary tank to prevent overflow,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,6500,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

When KMG operator returned outside he noticed a white cloud of anhydrous ammonia at the TW and he and the driver went upwind.    8:10 am- Our driver opened  the “snappy joe” valve, and took off the end cap on the 2” liquid hose and layed the hose on the ground on the south side of the wagon so the valve handle was vertical. Our driver then walked around to the north side of the TW and began pulling the hose underneath the trailer to perform his hook up. When he began pulling, the hose twisted and the valve handle contacted the ground causing it to open ¼ turn to 1/8 turn. He ran around the south side of the trailer to the “snappy joe” valve but saw he could not get there because of the leaking ammonia. He then went to the west side (back of the trailer) to activate the emergency shut off valve. The ammonia did not stop at this point. The KMG operator met with the driver at this time and the KMG operator called his supervisor. The fire alarm was pulled and employees were alerted to begin to shelter in place. A group of emergency responders went around to the west side of the building (upwind) and met with the driver and KMG operator to get more information. The KMG responders pulled the SCBA’s and PPE from the Truck wash emergency response box and proceeded to the southwest corner of the building. Two responders went to get the draeger tube kits and began to check the atmosphere at the east fence line. A  KMG responder got a pitchfork to try and position the hose to point downwind. Using chemical gloves and respirator the KMG responder’s intention was to position the hose to the east so that the “snappy joe” valve could be shut off (in the middle of the TW). When moving the unloading hose on the south side of the truck the wind was strong enough to keep the vapors away from the immediate area and the KMG responder. The KMG responder was able to safely shut the manual globe valve at the end of the liquid hose. After the valve was shut off we let the anhydrous on the ground evaporate (about 5 minutes). Shelter in place employees were given the okay to return to work at 8:42 a.m.    After the incident, our driver had the TW weighed at Transit Mix and returned to Pueblo plant, where supervisors determined it was safe to offload the wagon and not reject it. The weight tickets had a 580lb difference in the tare weight, which was attributed by Airgas to diesel fuel and possibly scale difference.

Cleanup Operations: ACT as the cleanup management company for Quality Carriers, contracted with USES to respond and assess the site.  Upon arrival the response team advised that the tanker was upside down in a ditch with an estimated 2000 gallons of product released.  The tank was drilled and the remaining product was offloaded into another tanker provided by Quality Carriers.  The liquid in the ditch had a pH of 1.  The liquid was neutralized with soda ash, caustic and lime.  Once neutralized the liquid was pumped out and stored off site in tanks for disposal.  An excavation of contaminated soil is planned for Wednesday, February 17, 2010 to remove all contaminated soil.  The excavation area measures approximately 350-feet long by 10 feet wide.     All waste will disposed of at Clean Harbors in White Castle, Louisiana.    An additional work plan for sampling and final cleanup was required by LA-DEQ to meet LA-RECAP requirments.    WORK PLAN    The first part of the Work Plan will consist soil sample collection, field analyses of soil samples for pH, and laboratory analysis of soil samples     Soil Assessment Activities     Soil sample collection and decontamination procedures will be performed using standard protocols approved by LDEQ according to the RECAP Appendix B Site Investigation Requirements, engineering practices approved by the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM), written procedures contained in A•C•T’s Corporate Quality Assurance Plan, and other scientific and engineering practices in conformance with standards for the industry.    Soil sample collection will be performed in the previously excavated area.  We estimate a total of 27 soil samples will be collected for laboratory analyses.  Five (5) on each side of the excavation and one (1) at each end.  Samples will be collected from the ground surface around the perimeter of the excavation and from approximately one (1) foot below the edge of the excavation.  At least three (3) background samples will also be collected from nearby locations, and concentrations of pH and sulfides will be compared to spill location concentrations.         Soil samples for laboratory analyses will be collected with a properly decontaminated stainless steel hand auger or other appropriate equipment.  The samples will be collected following LDEQ/RECAP soil sample collection and field decontamination guidance.  Equipment (rinsate) blanks and field duplicate (replicate) samples will be collected.  No trip blank will be collected since volatile organic compound analyses will not be performed.    Field pH analyses will be conducted on the collected soil samples.  Soil sample collection and analyses will generally follow the method described in Procedures for Collecting Soil Samples and Methods of Analysis for Soil Survey published by the United States Department of Agriculture – Soil Conservation",,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,70000,"American Compliance Technologies, Inc.",US,

Once we opened the trailer it was discovered that the gooseneck that was on the side of the tote had a weld that was broken up near the bottom of the tote.  This was allowing the material to leak out of the tote slowly.  The shipment was loaded properly and was protected with plywood.  We did not see any damage that appeared to cause the weld to break.

The overfill protection failed to stop the loading and the compartment overfilled. Product went into the vapor recovery line, traveled into other compartments through the vapor recovery rail, and was forced out the dome lid from being overfilled. About 103 gallons went on the ground in the containment area, no environmental impact was experienced. There is an ongoing investigation but it was found that there is a switch at the load rack which switches the overfill protection between the transports and railcars.

The loader immediately pressed the emergency stop button on the pump and radioed for help, then proceeded to attempt to close the railcar product valve. As the manager and several responders arrived on the scene it was observed that the bottom product valve would not completely close due to the damage and was still leaking from around the tank car adapter. The team proceeded to take a pipe wrench and straighten the valve stow cradle and was then able to completely close the valve and stop the leak. There was approximately two gallons of ethanol contained within the track pan. The team immediately secured the area and made all required notifications. Upon initial investigation of the incident it was confirmed that the vapor recovery system was properly connected and that valves were properly opened and all verifications had been properly conducted. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation.","During the course of the incident investigation, critical parts of the load setup were allowed to leave the facility prior to completion of the investigation.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder that was with the Railroad Safety Inspector tool tightened 1 of 6 manway securement bolt nuts that was found less than tool tight. Afterwards, a faint 'vapor hiss' persisted. BNSF contract responders were called to assist in the elimination of the 'vapor hiss' from ADMX 29662. The responders opened the manway lid and reported finding the manway gasket in good condition but out of position which most likely prevented a good manway closure seal. Responder's correctly positioned the manway gasket, closing the manway lid and properly tool tightening all manway securement bolt nuts.

The driver contacted dispatch immediately. Local fire and police responded to the scene. A 3"" vacuum cap was discovered to have fallen off of the tanker approximately 1,000 yards east of the vehicle.EMCO's fire responders collected all paperwork, including MSDS, identifying the material in the tanker, assessed the situation, and placed absorbent materials on the ground where product splashing occurred. With the permission ofthe local fire and state police authorities EMCO's HazMat Team cleaned up all materials from the roadway and replaced the damaged cap at the scene.A sewer cover at the west end of the vehicle was removed by North Chicago Fire Dept. and air monitored, indicating the presence of <1 PPM toluene. EMCO HazMat Team placed a boom in the hole. Local IEPA agent did not believe there was any impact to the local storm sewer. To ensure the collection of any potential foreign matter, EMCO placed a boom downstream for a week period. The boom was then removed and disposed of accordingly.The estimated quantity of release was approximately 5 gallons.

Driver was delivering ultra low sulfur diesel fuel to a customer location. While unloading the driver noticed the station did not have ulsd vapor recovery. So the driver decided he would use a coax fitting instead of a regular 4 inch drop fitting as was needed. The driver stated he used this fitting to vent the trailer. He did not run a vapor hose to it and left the vapor connection of the fitting open. As soon as the driver began the flow of product, fuel began to leak out of the vapor opening. The driver immediately shut off flow of product but approximately 7-8 gallons leaked onto concrete area. The product did not reach soil or drains. The spill was cleaned up by Florida Rock & Tank Lines safety supervisor and shop foreman.",The driver was not following proper unloading procedures.

The splashed BNSF employee was standing on the ground near the coupling location of TILX 14040 with another railcar. The employee immediately water rinsed impacted skin areas and was taken to a local hospital for examination and further treatment. The employee was released from the hospital with a prescription of an antibiotic burn cream and returned to duty. BNSF responders inspected TILX 14040 and reported the seal on the manway was intact. Six of eight manway securement bolt nuts were not tool tight (1 to 4 turns loose) and the other two securement bolts were not applied (hanging). The manway gasket was found to be of incorrect size and coupled with the loose closure securement prevented a good manway closure seal which allowed the product release during rail movement. BNSF contract responders fashioned a good fitting manway gasket from Gortex material and correctly positioned it in the manway lid. The manway was closed and all securement bolts were properly tool tightened. Spillage on the tank shell of TILX 14040 along with two other rail cars that were splash impacted were neutralized and cleaned. Spillage on the ground was also neutralized.  Intact seal removed was TRN 279527 and replaced with seal CHV 203417.  The side specification stencil on TILX 14040 indicated that the last tank qualification was completed in the year 2007 and next due in 2017.,Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3800,BNSF Railway Company,US,

One drum split open and spilled after leaving Pilot premises.A Pilot operator loaded the palletized drums onto a Caneda Transport box trailer approx 7:15 to 7:40 AM on Feb. 2, 2010. Chempax showed order was closed at 7:47 AM. The driver installed a bar jack and a ratchet strap to secure the freight. The driver sat in his cab until approx 8:30 AM before he drove away. He traveled I-75 North and pulled into the rest area around mile marker 28. He read and slept for approx 4.5 hours.Around 1 PM, he got out of his truck and did a trailer inspection. He noticed puddles of product at the front and rear of his trailer. He called the LCK plant stating that he would like to return to our plant to resolve the situation. The trailer arrived at the plant just after 2 PM; interviewed the driver to obtain information on the driver's company and his account of what happened. The damaged drum was at the very rear of the last row of pallets. The drum had a split about 1.5"" inches in length and 2"" up from the bottom of the drum. The split was along a molding seam. LCK personnel unloaded all of this freight and hosed off the bottoms of all pallets of residue. Personnel were then sent from Pilot's Middletown location to the rest area at mile marker 28 where material that had leaked from the truck was cleaned up. The driver was the one to install the load bar and the ratchet strap at the rear to secure the load. Based on the location of the ratchet bars that run along the sides of the trailer, one would expect the driver to have noticed if the drum was already split as he installed his brace and strap.

HENIFF TRANSPORTATION HAD A DRIVER THAT WAS HEADED WESTBOUND TO INTERSTATE 90 AT THE 166 MILE MARKER IN ROCK COUNTY NEAR EDGERTON, WISCONSIN.  THIS OCCURRED AT ABOUT 8:00PM.  THE DRIVER WAS IN THE LEFT LANE AND APPARENTLY JUST DROVE OFF THE ASPHALT PORTION OF THE LEFT SHOULDER.  WHEN THE DRIVER ATTEMPTED TO GET HIS VEHICLE BACK INTO THE LANE, HE MUST HAVE OVERCORRECTED.  WHEN THIS STEERING MANEUVER WAS TAKEN THE SURGE OF THE LIQUID AND THE CENTRIGUAL FORCE IN THE TANK CAUSED THE TANK TO ROLL ONTO ITS LEFT SIDE.  THE TRUCK REMAINED ON THE ROADWAY AND CAME TO REST ACROSS BOTH LANES.  THE WISCONSIN STATE PATROL HAD BEEN CALLED TO THE SCENE BY MOTORISTS DRIVING BEHIND THE HENIFF VEHICLE WHO WERE NOW UNABLE TO CONTINUE ON THE INTERSTATE.  THE MILTON TOWNSHIP FIRE DEPARTMENT ALSO RESPONDED TO THE SCENE.  HENIFF TRANSPORTATION RECEIVED A CALL AT ABOUT 9:00PM INFORMING US OF THE ACCIDENT.  AFTER SPEAKING TO THE DRIVER, MR. JOHN KELLY AND THE FIRE CHIEF, ROB CALHOUN ON THE SCENE, IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED TO GET A HAZMAT RESPONSE TEAM TO THE SCENE AND ALSO ANOTHER TRAILER TO TRANSFER THE PRODUCT BEFORE THE ROLLED TANKED COULD BE UP RIGHTED.  A WRECKER SERVICE HAD BEEN CALLED TO THE SCENE ALSO.  THE WRECKER SERVICE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO NOT ATTEMPT TO UPRIGHT THE VEHICLE UNTIL THE PRODUCT COULD BE TRANSFERRED.  I WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A SMALL LEAK AND IT HAD BEEN STOPPED.  WE THEN APPROVED THEM TO DRAG THE EQUIPMENT OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROADWAY SO TRAFFIC COULD GET BY.  THIS WAS DONE AND THE TRAFFIC WAS ALLOWED TO PASS AND THE ROADWAY WAS THEN SHUT DOWN.  HENIFF TRANSPORTATION READIED A DRIVER WITH A TRAILER AND TWO PERSONS TO ASSIST IN THE TRANSFER.  TRANS ENVIRONMENTAL HAZMAT RESPONDERS WERE PREPARING TO GO TO THE SCENE AND ASSIST HENIFF IN THE TRANSFER OF PRODUCT ALSO.  TRANS ENVIRONMENTAL PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT ABOUT 2:00AM.  THEY ATTENDED TO A SMALL DIESEL SPILL NEAR THE TRACTOR ON THE ROADWAY AND THEY WAITED FOR HENIFF TEAM TO ARRIVE.  HENIFF TEAM ARRIVES AT 3:00AM ON 2/10 AND ASSESSES THE SCENE IN PREPARATION TO TRANSFER.  THERE WERE NO STATE POLICE ON THE SCENE.  THERE WERE TWO WRECKERS AND ONE FIRE TRUCK.  TRANSFER BEGINS AT 3:45AM AND CONCLUDES AT 5:45AM.  NO PRODUCT WAS RELEASED DURING TRANSFER.  ALL PRODUCT CONTAINED IN ROLLED TRAILER WAS TRANSFERRED WITHOUT INCIDENT.  AT NO TIME WHILE ON THE SCENE DID ANYONE INDICATE THAT THERE HAD BEEN A SPILL OF PRODUCT PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF HENIFF OR TRANS ENVIRONMENTAL PERSONNEL.  THERE ALSO WAS NO VISIBLE INDICATION OF ANY PRODUCT SPILL OTHER THAN THE SMALL DIESEL LEAK FROM THE TRACTOR.  AT 6:15AM THE EMPTY TRACTOR AND TRAILER WERE UP RIGHTED AND TOWED FROM THE SCENE.  HENIFF PERSONNEL DEPARTED AT 6:20AM.  IT APPEARED AT THE TIME THAT THERE WOULD BE NO FURTHER CLEANUP NECESSARY.

The tractor-trailer overturned, releasing an undetermined amount of ammonia bi-chloride to the soil surface. The damaged tractor released approximately 50 gallons of diesel fuel and 1200 pounds of product to the soil surface.    On February 21, 2010,  Sentry Transportation Insurance retained Cura Emergency Services (CES) to manage the environmental cleanup operations on behalf of West Texas Express. The CES incident manager contacted Trooper Houser with Highway Patrol to gain additional information about the release. Based on available information, The CES incident manager dispatched a crew from DSC Environmental located in Ranger, Texas to assess the site and initiate corrective actions.    The crew from DSC arrived on site and met with local authorities to discuss the cleanup operations. DSC personnel secured the cap on the leaking saddle tank to prevent the further release of diesel fuel to the environment. DSC personnel then donned appropriate ppe and began to collect the containers of Haughto-Etch AX-2010 that had been released from the trailer. The top of the trailer was removed to better ventilate the work space. The DSC supervisor opened a confined space permit and DSC personnel donned respirators to enter the trailer. Upon inspection it was determined that all the containers had been damaged during the accident. The cargo was removed from the trailer and placed into roll-off containers. DSC personnel then utilized a skid steer to collect the remaining debris and impacted soil from cargo release area. Following the cleanup operations DSC personnel deconed their equipment, secured the site and de-mobilized for the day.    On February 22, 2010, DSC personnel returned to the site to complete the cleanup operations for the diesel fuel release. Guided by visual and olfactory indicators, DSC personnel utilized a backhoe to remove approximately 18 cubic yards of diesel-impacted soil from the release site. Following excavation operations, DSC personnel secured, and submitted,  four (4) confirmation soil samples for analysis by method TX1005 (total petroleum hydrocarbons). The area was then backfilled with clean fill material and re-graded to previous topography. The area was covered with TXDOT approved grass seed mixture and the crew de-mobilized.",n/a,Yes,DRUM,"Drum - fiber, metal or plastic not specified",DRUM,No,,,,ZZ,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,31224,Cura Emergency Services,US,
