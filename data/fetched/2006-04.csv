The wheel bolts came loose on the right hand rear wheel of the front nurse tank.  When the wheel fell off, the running gear landed on the axle hub.  This vibration caused the liquid withdrawal valve, located on top of the front nurse tank to open.  There was no mechanical defect or failure of the valve.  The valve appears to have opened due to the vibration caused from driving on the wheel hub.  The driver immediately pulled to the side of the road and exited the vehicle.  Company officails were contacted and the Plymouth County Sheriff's Office and the Akron, Iowa Volunteer Fire Department responded.  Highway C-12 was closed in both directions for approximately one hour.  The Volunteer Fire Department donned protective clothing, then approched the nurse tank and closed the valve, ending the release.  The driver of the pickup truck inhaled a small amount of ammonia vapor when he exited the vehicle.  He did not complain of any symptoms, but was checked out at the local hospital as a precautionary measure.  A small amount of vegetative burn was noted on the grass ditch along both sides of the highway.  No anhydrous ammonia reached the waters of the State.  No evacuations were required.  No clean-up or mitigation of the scene was required.","Farmers Cooperative Society conducts an annual inspection of all ammonia nurse tanks.  Daily inspections of each nurse tank are also conducted, prior to transportation.  Driver's who deliver the nurse tanks have been trained to inspect the nurse tanks and running gears for any defects or deficiencies.  Company officals will review that training with each driver and ensure that each driver conducts a complete inspection, prior to transporting the nurse tank.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,650,Farmers Cooperative Society,US,

Upon arrival on site, ACT applied absorbent material to the free liquid on the asphalt surface, and proceeded to sweep the spent material from the area.  Disposal will be coordinated directly by Kemiron Trans, Inc. per local, state, and federal regulations.  Please note, originally, the release was reported to have involved approximately 1,500 gallons of free product.

When approaching the 7.7 mile marker our driver  came upon a unoccupied vehicle that had been involved in a one vehicle accident and was disabled in the middle of the road with no lights or any other type of warning visible. Our driver swerved to the right to avoid the disabled vehicle and when doing so clipped the right front corner of the vehicle which in turn disabled his left front steer tire. As a result the truck was driven to the left into a cement ""Jersey"" barrier and slid against it until it came to a rest. While sliding against the cement road divider the friction cause the wheel/tire assembly to ignite which in turn ignited the trailer floor. The inner contents of the trailer contained a flammable shipment which further wicked the remaining non-hazardous shipments on board. The local fire department responded to the scene and proceeded to extinguish the fire through conventional fire fighting medians. The runoff from the fire mitigation entered and traveled through the storm water runoff system and eventually deposited and contaminated a 300 foot section of dry creek bed. The trailer was a total loss as was the contents it was carrying. The destroyed trailer was removed from the scene along with the charred contents and disposed of accordingly in accordance with all local, State and Federal regulations.. All contaminated lanes of Rte 287 were pressure washed and scrubbed to remove all traces of spilled products. The storm water runoff system was hydro-jetted and the runoff captured and properly disposed of. The contaminated soil in the dry creek bed was removed and properly disposed of.

The vehicle was carrying 9002 gallons of gasoline for delivery to a service station in Osprey, Florida. After the accident, the tractor came to rest upright while the tractor was on its right side. The fuel tank of the tractor ruptured, spilling approximately 60 gallons of own consumption Low Sulfur Diesel fuel. The tanker trailer did not rupture; however, one dome cover had a small leak which resulted in a spill of about 30 gallons of regular unleaded gasoline. Police, local fire departments, Haz-Mat teams and Motiva’s contract OSRO responded to the incident. The spill area was limited mainly to the roadway, with a small amount reaching a 2 ft. strip in the median. Approximately 20 cubic yards of soil will be removed during the remediation process.

The material made it to the storm sewer ballast drains beneath the tracks. (Note:  storm water from the facility is normally pumped to the in-house process sewer treatment system which discharges to the municipal POTW). An isolation valve immediately downstream of the spill was closed to isolate the material within the storm sewer. The waters from the isolated pit were pumped into the process sewer. No material left the site.  • Material in the track pan and in the accompanying sump was pumped to a RCRA storage tank.  • A low spot was dug in the gravel and the collected material was pumped into the sump.  Package failure:  A float that indicates the level in the tank car was found damaged due to deterioration and aging therefore there was no visual indication of the level in the tank car.  Duration of release:  The release was less than 10 minutes.","• The float indicator was replaced.  • The operator was given follow-up training emphasizing the need to pay closer attention during loading operations.    Note:  • The initial determination was that the spill of this sodium hydrosulfide mixture was less than the RQ (2272 gallons) for this material, based on the time the operator was away and the visual observation of the in-house emergency responders. The actual amount would be determined when the T/C was weighed and compared to the storage tank level reading.  • On April 11, 2006 the tank car was weighed and the ensuing calculations from the storage tank level showed that apparently 2600 gallons (26,000 pounds) had been released, which was in excess of the RQ. Although the visual observation dicE not support this amount, it was reported as an RQ release.  • Upon further review following the release reporting it became evident that the storage tank liquid level indication was in error and that the amount of the spill had been over reported. Also, it was determined by lab analysis, that the percentage of sodium hydrosulfide in the mixture was only 7%, compared to the conservative MSDS value of 22%.  • Based on pumping rate and the time the operator was away from the loading operation it was determined that the entire spill was 607 gallons (6075 pounds) and that the sodium hydrosulfide amount was 425 pounds, which is below the 5,000 pound RQ for sodium hydrosulphide.",Yes,,,,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,700,,US,

The damaged container was held at our facility and the shipper was notified.

Another employee noticed liquid leaking from the back of the trailer and alerted the hostler.  Employees effectively dammed the area around the trailer to prevent the spread of the material as possible.  The area around the trailer was isolated.  City of Auburn Fire Dept responded.  Notifications were made to the National Spill Response Center and the Washington Department of Ecology.  A Hazmat response team from NRC Environmental responded and identified two spider web cracks in the inside plastic container that allowed the material to leak.  The two cracks were approximately 8 to 12 inches in diameter along the top edges and side of the plastic tote.  NRC Environmental indicated that the plastic container had become brittle and weakened due to exposure to heat and/or cold.  The material leaked onto the ground for twenty to thirty minutes prior to containment and was approached cautiously.  The cleanup continued over two days.  Contamination was limited to asphalt where the material was neutralized and a strip of lawn adjoining the lot approximately 20' by 40'.","From our understanding the incident was the result of cracks in a plastic IBC that was in a brittle or weakened condition.  (NRC Environmental reported that they were able to poke a hole in the plastic with a finger)  With inside pressure of the liquid, our driver could not have identifed the weakness or nature of the material at the pickup point.  The spill and resulting damage could have been avoided by proper storage of empty containers.",No,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,68000,Oak Harbor Freight Lines,US,

The process sewer valve is normally closed, unless draining the area, and the valve was confirmed secured. No material made it to the storm sewer or left the site.  • Pumps on adjacent tanks were shutoff as a precaution to prevent ignition of vapors.  • In-house emergency response personnel sprayed foam over the entire area to minimize vapor release.  • Approximately 1250 gallons was pumped out of the tank to another tank to lower the level in the overfilled storage tank.  • Material in the low area of the tank farm was pumped to a portable tank and then transferred to a permitted RCRA storage tank.  • The area was continually flushed with water. The water/petroleum naphtha mixture was transferred to a tank truck and then transferred to a permitted RCRA storage tank. Over 12,000 gallons of water flushing and material was collected.  • Additional water flushing was determined to be acceptable to put directly to the in-house process sewer treatment system which discharges to the municipal POTW.","• This tank had been put into this service the previous month. A typographical error occurred when transmitting the safe tops level reading to the operating personnel.  • A spreadsheet is used to calculate the safe tops for a storage tank. The calculation uses the outage on the tank along with the specific gravity and temperature to determine the safe tops. The size of the tank in gallons is also included in the spreadsheet, but was not needed in any of the calculations. A separate line has been added that uses the size of the tank to give a second check for the safe tops calculation. The cross check calculation will ensure that a typo has not occurred and prevent a recurrence of the release.",Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,5000,THE LUBRIZOL CORPORATION,US,

The operator shut down and checked the valve it appeared OK.  Upon resuming the stem of the valve shot out of the valve followed by a guizer of product.  The operator shut down the transfer and closed the loading valve and internal valve on the trailer however the internal valve was slightly leaking.  During the incident the IMTT employee was lightly sprayed on the legs and exposed to fumes.  The employee immedately removed contaminated clothing and footware.  The employee showered and declined medical evaluation.    The Langer Director of Safety and Personnel responded to the site and particpated with the onsite ERT in securring the trailer and replacing the affected valve so the trailer could leave the site for further evaluation.  The product was shipped on another Langer trailer.,Upon examination of the valve on the day of the incident it appears the cotter pin holding the valve assemble together was missing and could not be located during the repair.  At the time of this report it remains unclear if the valve was re-assembled and installed without the cotter-pin after cleaning of the trailer or the cotter-pin broke and dislodged and was lost in this product or other products.  It appears that after use the valve became loose over time.

The Consignee hooked up their nitgrogen to help blow the line clean. The pressure from the nitrogen seperated the male fitting on the discharge hose causing it to come off of the unload valve of the trailer allowing the spillage to occur. The Consignee and the Driver cleaned up the spill which was in a containment area by scooping it up after it dried and properly disposed of it.,It is believed that the male fitting on the end of the dischage hose must not have been secure enough.

The thunderstorm caused the top of a tree to break off and fall onto the cab of the driver's tractor.  This event caused the driver to lose control and leave the traveled portion of the roadway and into a field.  The unit proceeded to collide with another tree and finnally come to rest when the unit collided with a second tree.  The collision with the second tree caused a puncture of the front bulk head of the trailer the approximate size of a quarter or 1 inch.    The LA State Police Hazardous Material Response Team responded and took charge of the accident scene.  Superior Carriers dispatched a hazardous material clean-up crew to the scene to assist with the clean up and disposal of the contaminated soil and other materials.    The LA State Police Hazardous Material Response Team decided that the best course of action to be taken was to let the product solidfy.

The train crew inspecting their train found five railcars derailed including one tank car (PROX 40438) derailed on its side. The cause of this derailment was contributed to the cross level of the track (not at rail joints) north of the derailment site being irregular. A small amount of product released from PROX 40438 via the vacuum relief valve (VRV) and the bottom outlet valve (BOV). The external BOV was sheared off but the internal ball valve was intact, but a small drip ensued. Within an hour after their arrival, local F.D. responders were able to wrap the VRV with plastic and secured it with tape which slowed the drips. Buckets were placed under the VRV. PROX 40438 was uprighted and set atop blocks, clear of the main track by 0130 hrs. PDT, 4/20/06. Buckets were placed under PROX 40438 to catch any drippage from the BOV. The product in PROX 40438 was offloaded into vacuum trucks with completion by 1800 hrs. PDT, 4/20/06.

Train crew setout GATX 25789 at the north setout track (#4295) at Seligman, AZ. BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder placed lined tubs under GATX 25789 to catch any escaping liquid. By 2000 hrs. MDT (4/19/06), the leak had slowed to a drip with approximately two gallons accumulating in the receptacle. BNSF and contract responders determined that most likely a compromise in the tank shell possibly caused by rubber liner failure. It appeared that welding of several broken support brackets attaching the upper guard railing had occurred. The welding atop the shell may have heated and compromised the rubber lining. Product leaked through the compromised liner, gravitated to the sump area and released. The product in GATX 25789 was transferred into UTLX 130271 on 4/21/06 without incident. Afterwards, when moving GATX 25789, product heel escaped from the sump area. Contract responders sealed the area around the sump to ensure no residue product that remained inside GATX 25789 would readily leak out during transit to a repair facility. FRA-06050116 was granted to move GATX 25789 to the repair facility.

Nitroform consists of 70-75% water, 30-35% of trinitromethane, and <1% urea as a stabilizer. Each container was a 30-gallon metal drum with a plastic liner and each appeared to be in good condition (non-leaking). Containers were overpacked into 55-gallon metal open head drums for transport to ECOFLO's facility in York, PA. In route six of the original twenty drums began to react creating an acid cloud (nitric acid is a precursor to trinitromethane). Three drums reacted completely. Three drums reacted partially. Fourteen drums did not react. The six drums that reacted had inner containers inverted into the overpacked outer container.    Reaction occured for several hours (four to five) with local, State and private HAZMAT firms on hand. Residuals were neutralized (with soda ash) and/or flushed with water by the local and State HAZMAT teams. Following the completion of the reaction, ECOFLO's private contractor (HMHTTC) consolidated solid residuals and debris generated during the reaction and overpacked all 20 containers into 95-gallon poly salvage drums. All drums and waste were reloaded onto ECOFLO's vehicle for completion of trip to ECOFLO's York, PA yard for further testing and evaluation.    The inner plastic containers on the 30-gallon drums are suspected to have failed that caused the contents to release and react with the two outer containers (the 30 gallon and the 55 gallon metal drums).     14 of the drums that were not involved in the reaction were returned to Navy facility at Indian Head, MD on Friday June 16, 2006    The three drums that reacted totally along with the debris from the initial cleanup was shipped to ECOFLO in Greensboro, NC for disposal    The three drums that partially reacted were consolidated into one 30-gallon poly drum on Friday, June 16, 2006 and await final disposition by the Navy.","Investigation into the actual composition of this material (primary component is trinitromethane) is ongoing. It is critical to receive current data on age of this material and up-to-date analysis reflecting the amount of stabilizer added (and date added) to confirm or determine stability.    During the overpacking process, containers should be overpacked in an upright manner.

WASHINGTON, D.C. HAD BEGUN TO LEAK DIESEL FUEL. EMPLOYEE INDICATED THAT SHE HAD COMPLETED FUELING EQUIPMENT ON THE SITE AND LEFT HER TRUCK PARKED ON THE EASTBOUND SIDE OF VAN NESS STREET WHILE SHE WENT UP TO THE CHERRY HILL OFFICE TRAILER. SHE WAS WALKING BACK TO HER TRUCK FROM THE TRAILER AND WAS AT THE INTERSECTION OF INTERNATIONAL DRIVE AND VAN NESS WHEN SHE NOTICED THE LEAK. UPON INVESTIGATION, EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY FAILURE OF A HOSE COUPLING ON THE LINE FROM THE MAIN TANK TO THE PUMP. THE LEAK ORIGINATED AROUND THE COUPLING AND THERE WAS NOT A “HOLE” IN THE LINE IT WOULD BE BETTER DESCRIBED AS A SEPARATION OF THE METAL COUPLING FROM THE LINE. THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE RELEASE IS 8-10 MINUTES. THE ABSORBENT THAT WAS STORED ON THE FUEL TRUCK WAS DEPLOYED IMMEDIATELY.     OTHER CHERRY HILL PERSONNEL RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY TO CONTAIN THE SPILLED FUEL. ANOTHER MALE EMPLOYEE (CHERRY HILL SUPERINTENDENT) HAD THE ON-SITE SPILL KIT BROUGHT TO THE SCENE AND DEPLOYED MORE ABSORBENT AS WELL AS ABSORBENT PADS. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:40 AM MALE EMPLOYEE CALLED ME TO NOTIFY ME OF THE SPILL. I ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED ME TO BRING THE SPILL KIT FROM OUR TAYLOR STREET BRIDGE PROJECT AND HE RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. I LOADED THE SPILL KIT AND PROCEEDED TOWARD THE CHINA EMBASSY PROJECT. I CALLED MY SUPERVISOR (CHERRY HILL SAFETY DIRECTOR) TO NOTIFY HIM OF THE SPILL AND HE INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS ALREADY AWARE OF THE SPILL AND THAT CLEAN VENTURES (CLEAN-UP CONTRACTOR) HAD ALREADY BEEN NOTIFIED AND WAS PREPARING TO RESPOND TO THE SPILL.    AT APPROXIMATELY 12:10-12:15 PM I ARRIVED ON THE SCENE. I NOTED THE FUEL TRUCK WAS PARKED JUST EAST OF THE SITE ACCESS CLOSEST TO THE SINGAPORE EMBASSY AND A STREAM OF FUEL HAD TRAVELED FROM THE TRUCK DOWNHILL TOWARD CONNECTICUT AVENUE. I ALSO NOTED CHERRY HILL PERSONNEL SPREADING ABSORBENT IN THE INTERSECTION OF INTERNATIONAL DRIVE AND VAN NESS.     THE ABSORBENT AND PADS FROM THE SPILL KIT I BROUGHT WERE IMMEDIATELY PLACED ON THE FUEL IN THE INTERSECTION OF INTERNATIONAL DRIVE AND VAN NESS. AS THE ABSORBENT WAS BEING PLACED I HEARD SIRENS FROM DCFD EQUIPMENT.     ONCE DCFD ARRIVED I SOUGHT OUT THE INCIDENT COMMANDER (BATTALION CHIEF - NO NAME) TO NOTIFY HIM THAT DCFD SHOULD CHECK THE OUTFALL OF THE STORM SEWER FOR POSSIBLE FUEL. HE SENT DCFD PERSONNEL TO SOAPSTONE TO CHECK ON THE STATUS AND BASED UPON THE FACT THAT CHERRY HILL WAS ACTIVELY CLEANING THE SPILL AND HAD A CLEAN-UP CONTRACTOR ON THE WAY HE REMOVED THE DCFD EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL FROM THE SCENE. THE CAPT. (SOD BATTALION CHIEF) REMAINED ON THE SCENE. HE ADVISED THAT HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BATTALION THAT INCLUDES HAZMAT.

Where: Chevron Station at 8710 SW Hall Blvd. Beaverton, OR   Who: The driver involved was Richard Trembly, located out of our Portland Terminal. Mr. Trembly started with Harris on October 6, 1993.   What: Harris Transportation Company, LLC truck and trailer 280/281 arrived to unload fuel at the Chevron Station on Hall Blvd. IvIr. Trembly connected his delivery hose to the fitting on the midgrade tank. When he opened the valve to start flow, the camlock ears were not secure to the fitting and the hose came off the fitting spilling gasoline onto the concrete and asphalt area. The product traveled down the parking area towards a drain. Mr. Trembly started laying out absorbent pads to minimize the spill. Mike Dailey and Ken Lutz arrived to clean up the spill area. Absorbent material was spread out over the entire spill area and swept up into bags and taken back to the terminal for disposal.. The drain grate was removed and pads placed in the drain to absorb any fuel that may have entered the drain. The level in the drain was below the run off discharge line.   Contributing Factors: [Mr. Trembly did not secure the camlock ears on the delivery hose to the fitting before opening up the product flow.   Loss Information: Approx. 20—25 gals of gas spilled onto the area around the tank. The station was closed at the time and had no impact to the public. The spill was   reported to the following agencies:   Oregon Emergency Response (Kathy) — Case #061108 0715   Oregon DEQ (Julie Berdt) 0725   National Response Center (Miss Johnson) — Report # 795452 0730   EPA (Calvin Terads) 0800   Insurance Information: Not reported to Insurance",SEE ATTACHED HARRIS REPORT #5606.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,HARRIS TRANSPORTATION CO.

Osie, Wichita, KS. The branch management and the Wichita Fire Department were immediately contacted.    The fire department arrived at 0631:39 and made entrance to the locked fence surrounding the tank. They found a valve that was slightly open, closed the valve and stopped the leak. The leak was onto the concrete pad and due to the slow volume of the release it simply vaporated. At 0710:20 they declared the leak secured, area safe and departed the scene. They estimated that approximately 10 gallons of oxygen, refrigerated liquid had been released.    Investigation determined that on the afternoon of 4-11-06 John Haartje, Logistics Supervisor had locked the tank valve and access gate. Apria employees Mark Descher, Transportation Lead and Larry Ervin, Patient Service Technician, witnessed this. At that time the valve appeared to be functioning properly.    On 4-17-06 a technician from BOC Gases, which is contracted for maintenance and LOX supply, inspected the tank and found everything functioning properly. He advised that there had been instances of theft by unknown subjects of cryogenic liquids in the area for use in clandestine drug operations.

The impact caused the axel to be knocked out from under the bobtail which in turn casued the front of the truck to hit the pavement, spin and come to rest on it's passenger side.  Approximately 3-5 gallons of liquid propane was released from the relief valve.  The relief valve was not damaged nor did it ever touch the gound.  The tank sustained a large dent and scrape on the passenger side and most likely the release at the relief valve was caused by the build up of pressure sustained from the trauma of the accident.  Approximately 2-3 gallons of liquid propane was released at a small fitting on the truck meter.  The fitting was knocked off in the crash.  We do not have the police report yet from the Washington State Police, but it has been ordered.  The Washington State Police could not provide us with a report number.",According to our driver and other witnesses the driver of the passenger vehicle veered over into the oncoming lane at the last second giving our driver no time to react.

Allegany HazMat arrived on site and found that the car was leaking from the 2” ball valve where it screws onto the liquid line. The pressure was relieved on the car and the leak stopped. SPSI arrived on site and determined that no teflon tape/pipe dope was used to lubricate the threads between the ball valve and the liquid line. SPSI used teflon tape and pipe dope to resecure the valve to the liquid line. Ashland Chemical received a FRA movement approval to forward the rail car. On 04/20/06, FRA. Inspector Matsinger, was inspecting this car and discovered the vacuum relief valve was not functioning correctly and advised CSX Transportation that it needed to be fixed prior to the car moving. CSX Transportation notified Ashland Chemical who hired Rescar to replace the valve. Rescar could not do a bubble leak test on the car while it was loaded. Ashland applied for and received an updated movement approval.

The discharge duration was from 2:00 am. until 4:00p.m. on April 30, 2006.   The tractor/trailer unit was traveling west bound on 1-10 when a police car was chasing a Ford Taurus and passed the tractor trailer at a high rate of speed. When the tractor/trailer approached the top of an overpass, the TransWood driver saw the police car with its emergency lights on and had the Ford Taurus pulled over on the left side of the highway. The TransWood driver had slowed downand was in the right hand lane when the driver of the Ford Taurus puH the highway to the right hand lane in front of the TransWood driver. The TransWood driver moved to the right shoulder to keep from hitting the Ford Taurus and at that point the tractor/trailer hit the grass which caused the driver to loose control of the unit. The tractor/trailer rolled over going down Into the ditch.   One of the tubes on the trailer which was carrying Silicon Tetrafluoride was damaged and started leaking. Product identification: Cas #7738-61-1, DOT #UN 1859. The product loss from the tube was 1600 pounds.   The local fire department sprayed water on the product which is a compressed gas to keep the vapors from discharging into the air. After the tube had completely emptied, the tractor/trailer was up-righted and was towed to Mosaic in Uncle Sam, Louisiana.   The clean up was done by U.S. Environmental Services of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The clean up crew filled thirteen (13) roll off boxes of soil. brush, and trees. The exact amount in pounds will be determined a disposal time. There was water in the ditch which was tested and the PH levei was six (6) according Raymond Boutte’.   I do not have the name of the driver that was operating the Ford Taurus which caused the accident and subsequent discharge. This information will be available to TransWood when the Louisiana State Police release the accident report. The product was from Mosaic in Uncle Sam, Louisiana, the trailer is owned by MEMC in Pasadena, Texas and the tractor is stationed at TransWood in Lake Charles, Louisiana.   The discharge was non preventable. The vehicle pulled into our lane of traffic and stopped, causing the tractor/trailer to move to the right going into the ditch and rolling over which damaged the trailer tube and caused the discharge   The person doing this report is Richard Thorpe, Held Safety Auditor for TransWood Incorporated.
