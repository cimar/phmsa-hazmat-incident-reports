THE LOADING TERMINAL WAS KINDER MORGAN IN SPARTANBURG, NC.  WHILE TRAVELING NORTH BOUND ON HIGHWAY 64 APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES OUTSIDE OF RUTHERFORDTON, LEO STARTED INTO A CURVE THAT BORE TO THE LEFT.

LEO TRIED TO RIDE THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD UNTIL HE COULD SAFELY GET BACK ON THE PAVEMENT.

THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER BOTH ROLLED DOWN THE EMBANKMENT AND CAME TO REST IN THE CREEK BED JUST BESIDE A SMALL BRIDGE/CULVERT.  THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER BOTH BECAME ENGULFED IN FLAMES.  THE WRECK RESULTED IN THE DEATH OF RELIABLE TANK LINE DRIVER LEO ZDYB.  TRUCK 189 AND TRAILER 220 WERE TOTALLY DESTROYED.  THERE WAS VERY LITTLE PRODUCT LEFT IN THE TRAILER AS IT WAS LEFT ON ITS SIDE IN THE CREEK.  WHAT PRODUCT/WATER/FOAM THAT WAS LEFT IN THE TRAILER WAS PUMPED OUT BEFORE THE REMAINS OF THE TRAILER COULD BE REMOVED FROM THE CREEK.  WATER CONTAMINATION WAS MINIMAL DUE TO THE HEAVY FIRE THAT CONSUMED MOST OF THE PRODUCT.

THE AREA AROUND THE CAR WAS ISOLATED AND THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES WERE NOTIFIED.  THE CARRIER CALLED AN EMERGENCY CONTRACTOR (REACT ENVIRONMENTAL) TO RESPOND AND INSPECT/REPAIR THE CAR AS NECESSARY.  UPON INSPECTION THE CONTRACTOR FOUND THAT THE NIPPLE FOR THE 3"" LIQUID LINE VALVE WAS CRACKED AT THE JUNCTION BETWEEN THE THREADS OF THE NIPPLE AND THE 3"" BALL VALVE. THE VALVE ITSELF WAS LOOSE AND PRODUCT WAS ESCAPING AROUND THE THREADS OF THE VALVE.  THE CONTRACTOR RELIEVED SOME OF THE INTERNAL PRESSURE IN THE CAR BY OPENING THE VAPOR LINE.  THE REDUCTION IN INTERNAL PRESSURE SLOWED THE LEAK CONSIDERABLY.  THE CONTRACTOR THEN REMOVED THE 3"" BALL VALVE AND APPLIED EPOXY COMPOUND TO THE FRACTURED PORTION OF THE PIPE NIPPLE.  THE BLIND OUTLET PLUG WAS THEN THREADED INTO THE NIPPLE AND THE LEAK STOPPED. NO OTHER LEAKING FITTINGS WERE FOUND.  DUE TO THE VOLATILE NATURE AND HIGH EVAPORATION RATE OF THE PRODUCT, THERE WAS LITTLE SPILLED MATERIAL TO RECOVER.  SUBSEQUENT TO REPAIRING THE LEAKING VALVE, A MOVEMENT AUTHORITY WAS REQUESTED AND GRANTED TO MOVE THIS CAR TO SILSBEE, TX FOR FURTHER REPAIR.

AS THE FORKLIFT OPERATOR (VIDEL HERNANDEZ) WAS PULLING THE PALLET OFF, HE ATTEMPTED TO TURN THE FORKLIFT HOWEVER IN DOING SO THE PALLET HIT THE FORKLIFT WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT NEXT TO THE SYSTEM.  HE LATER AFTER DISCUSSING IT WITH HIM FELT THAT THE PALLET HAD SLID, HE DECIDED TO GO IN UNDER IT IN AN ATTEMPT TO PICK IT BACK UP.  IN DOING SO, HE PUSHED THE PALLET IN AND ONTO THE FORK BLADE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT UP CAUSING THE FORKLIFT BLADE TO PUNCHER THE STEEL JERRICAN WHICH HAD BEEN FLOOR LOADED.  BECAUSE THE FORKLIFT OPERATOR HAD YET TO SEE THE JEEP BEHIND THE PALLET HE ASSUMED IT WAS HEAVIER THAN EXPECTED CAUSING HIM TO ATTEMPT TO GO IN DEEPER WITH HIS BLADES, AS THIS TIME HE NOTICED THE RESISTANCE AND GOT DOWN FROM THE FORKLIFT TO CHECK. AFTER NOTICING THE LEAK HE ADVISED HIS SUPERVISOR WHO INFORMED JAL MOD AND FOLLOWED UP BY CALLING THE BREAKDOWN MANAGER AND THE WAREHOUSE MANAGER JOE RAMIREZ.  JOE CALLED ME TO ADVISE AND ONCE I ARRIVED I ASSUMED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ATTAINING THE UN NUMBER, CLASS AND PIECES DAMAGED.  I THEN CHECK MY EMERGENCY RESPONSE BOOK AND FOLLOWED THE PROCEDURES BY PLACING OIL DRY MATERIAL OVER THE SPILL AND REMOVING THE NET AND PLASTIC.

WE THEN SECTIONED OFF THE EVA SIDE USING STRAPS AND WAITED FOR THE RESPONSE TEAM.  AFTER ARRIVAL I ADVISED THE CHIEF OF THE SITUATION AND WHAT WE HAD DID TO THAT POINT.  WE SUPPLIED OUR CHEMICAL SPILL CANISTERS AND SEVERAL BAGS OF OIL DRY AND AWAITED THE HAZ MAT RESPONSE TEAM HE CALLED.  I FOLLOWED UP BY CONTACTING OUR EMERGENCY SPILL CENTER AND ADVISING OF ALL INFORMATION.  LASTLY THE HAZ MAT RESPONSE TEAM CLEANED THE AREA ON OUR BEHALF AND ADVISED THAT OUR SPILL CENTER DISPOSE OF THE MATERIAL AS SOON POSSIBLE.  PER MY DISCUSSION WITH THE CENTER THEY WILL BE HERE ON MONDAY TO DISPOSE OF IT.  NO ONE WAS HURT AND OR NEEDED TREATMENT.

HE WAS ABLE TO PREVENT ANY OFF SITE MIGRATION BY PLACING CHEMICAL ABSORBENT SOCKS AT THE LOW SPOT WHILE THE COMPEQ TECHNICIANS ASSISTED IN MOPPING UP THE RELEASE.  THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED AT 4:00 PM, MST.  MIKE NOTIFIED ME, BOB SOLLESVIK, OF THE INCIDENT AT 4:10 PM MST.  I THEN CONTACTED MY REGIONAL OPERATIONS MANAGER, CHARLY BONNIE AND DISTRICT MANAGER, LARRY DAVIS BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE SPILL SITE.  UPON ARRIVAL I MET TED WITTE, COMPEQ INTERNATIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGER WHO WAS OVERSEEING THE CLEAN-UP.  MOST OF THE RAW PRODUCT HAD BEEN RECOVERED INTO THE LARGE CATCH BASIN BELOW THE CHEMICAL FILL FITTINGS.  THE COMPEQ EMPLOYEES HAD ALREADY WASHED DOWN THE TRUCK, CONCRETE RAMP AND DRIVE AND WERE MOPPING UP AS I WAS TAKING PICTURES AND REVIEWING THE DAMAGED PUMP.  THE RECLAIMED MIXTURE OF SPENT CUPRIC CHLORIDE AND WATER, (APPROX. 80-90 GAL.), WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE TANKER AFTER REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE PUMP.  ROOT CAUSE: THERE ARE THREE POSSIBLE SCENARIOS THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT.  1. THE OUTLET CONNECTION ON THE T/T PUMP HAD A 1 1/2"" NIPPLE BETWEEN THE FLANGE AND THE 2"" CAMLOCK FITTING.  WITH EACH CONTINUOUS CAVITATION OF THE PUMP, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE AND VIBRATION THAT OVER TIME CAN WEAKEN THE PVC FITTING CAUSING IT TO SNAP.  A SUPPORT FOR THE HOSE COULD ALLEVIATE THIS.  2.  THE 1 1/2"" NIPPLE BETWEEN THE OUTLET FLANGE AND 2"" CAMLOCK FITTING WAS BOTTOMED OUT AND GLUED TO THE FLANGE WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN TO STOP PREVIOUS LEAKING OR LOOSENESS OF THE THREADS.  3.  HAVING A 1 1/2"" PUMP BETWEEN 2"" SUCTION AND DISCHARGE HOSES COULD BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE HIGH FLOW PRESSURE ON THE DISCHARGE SIDE.  A 2"" PUMP COULD ALLEVIATE THIS BY HAVING A CONSISTENT FLOW FROM THE SUPPLY TANK TO THE TANKER TRAILER.  CORRECTIVE ACTION:  AFTER A REVIEW OF THE INCIDENT WITH THE UNIVAR SAFETY COMMITTEE, WE HAVE DETERMINED THE MOST REASONABLE CAUSE FOR THE FITTING FAILURE WAS DUE TO STRESS PLACED ON THE OUTLET CONNECTION OF THE TRANSFER HOSE.  WE HAVE CONTACTED OUR HOSE SUPPLIER TO MODIFY THE CURRENT HOSE BY SHORTENING IT TO LESSEN THE STRESS ON THE PUMP CONNECTIONS AND WILL HAVE BRACE INSTALLED TO SUPPORT THE OUTLET FLANGE SIMILAR TO THE INLET CONNECTION.  WE WILL TEST THE PROCESS BEFORE OUR NEXT SCHEDULED PICK UP TO INSURE IT'S SAFE OPERABILITY.  SIDE NOTE: AFTER REPLACING THE EXISTING DISCHARGE HOSE WITH A SHORTER LENGTH AND REPLACING THE OUTLET FLANGE FITTINGS, WE TESTED THE PUMP AND NOTICED A SIZEABLE LESSENING OF PRESSURE AND TORQUE ON THE OUTLET FLANGE.  WILL MOVE FORWARD ON BRACING THE FLANGE AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE CHANGES.",,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,500,,US,
