The CCVTs were oil filled and shipped to the TSDF classified as PCB material.  This initial classification was based on the PCB assumption requirements of 40 CFR 761 since actual concentration of PCB was not confirmed by testing.      During a roadside inspection, it was discovered that a CCVT was leaking a small amount of oil which was contained within the pan-lined trailer.  Upon further investigation, it was determined that the CCVT failed due to a crack in the ceramic portion of the unit.  The unit is approximately 8 feet long and is constructed of steel, copper and ceramics.  The spill was cleaned and the NRC was notified because the concentration of PCBs was unknown at the time.    Upon arrival at the TSDF, the data plate was retrieved from the CCVT, which shows that the unit was manufactured in 2000 and contained no PCB's.  This information was later confirmed by lab testing of the spilled material.  Lab data was not available to the shipper at the time the item was originally offered for transportation, so they took a conservative approach and shipped the item as PCB material until it could be confirmed by testing.  As such, the unit was described as a hazardous material on the shipping paper.  In addition, all activities up to the time where the concentration of PCBs could be confirmed, were conducted as though the oil was a hazardous material.  After confirming that the material did not contain regulated levels of PCBs, the NRC was contacted and the spill report was modified to note that an RQ release did not occur.","Although Special Provision 81 allows PCB items to be shipped as is when specification packaging is impractical, Veolia ES Technical Solutions is conducting an evaluation of alternate methods of packaging and securing items which have a high percentage of ceramic.",No,BOX,"Box, wood or fiberboard not specified",BOX,No,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

Freight assigned to pro 709169661 was loaded on skids three (3) across in the nose of trailer Gork-4440. These skids were tight up againist one another with zero visabillty between skids. The damage was discovered once the freight was pulled to the floor due to the fact that the damage was in the front right hand corner of the skid. When loaded the front right corner of the pallet scored the cartons, then pails, causing the spill. We found that both the stretch wrap and the cardboard of the box the shipment was packaged in were torn away from the nose of the trailer. This leads us to believe that the damage occurred during the loading rather than the unload process. Had this incident occurred while unloading the material listed above would have torn in the opposite direction. Once we discovered the spill we immediately notified our Safety Manager to inform him of the incident. The packages were torn open by the corner of a pallet when loaded. The packages had a one (1) by six (6) inch tear in them. The pails had dents/folds with a small tear in the metal, about a centimeter in diameter.

The response crew collected all spilled material and placed it, along with the damaged container into a suitable salvage drum for continuing transportation.  Prior to departure from the site that area was inspected and it was determined that all released material was cleaned and the truck was placed back into service.","Prior to departure, the load was inspected and no visible sign of damage was identified during the loading process.  In order to prevent a recurrence, drivers willbe instructed to continue to inspect each container before it is accepted for transportation and to take appropriate actions should a damaged or suspect container be indentified.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3300,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

The loader then went to the bottom of the rack and installed the belly cap on the railcar sitting on spot #1.  At approximately 11:50 am he was approaching the railcar sitting on spot #2 and he heard loud popping noises coming from the railcar being loaded on spot #3.  He saw product “jumping” out of the dome of railcar CPDX 202087 and he ran to the pump shut off switch which is located under the rack near spot #1.  He then went on top of the rack and shut the valve to the loading arm.  The railcar continued to make “popping” noises.  When he was certain that it was safe to approach the dome lid of the railcar he looked inside the car and saw that the product level was exactly on the marker.","Loading racks supervisor will reaffirm with the railcar loaders the need to pay close attention to the railcars that are filling, especially with hot or reactive products.

The railcar loader assigned to assist the driver accessed the top of the railcar and opened the dome lid to check the railcar and verified that the flow had started.  The loader said it looked like 2 to 2.5 feet of the hose extended into the railcar.  After verifying that the flow had started, he descended the rack without closing the lid onto the transfer hose.  Both the truck driver and the loader stood at the back of the truck while the transfer occurred.  When the truck emptied, a surge of air caused the hose end to jump out of the railcar and spray sulfur onto the rack, ground and railcar.  The truck driver stated that the air pressure was the same as previous transfers and the only difference was the dome lid position.  The loader stated that he thought that the lid should have been in the open position and that he was not formally trained on the procedure.",A safety stand down meeting was conducted the morning of 02/16/2007 with the Loading Racks Division and the Safety Department.

He then contacted his Facility Manager who began the required notification process at approximately 10:20AM. Oil Mop LLC, along with LA DEQ, arrived on-scene at approximately 11:15AM. Under the direction of LA DEQ, Oil Mop personnel proceeded to mitigate the immediate spill area. At the request of the New Orleans Police Dept., the Dept. of Transportation spread sand on a section of Interstate 10 East that had been closed due to the spill.

Upon arrival, the driver positioned the tank on a contained loading pad and loading operations commenced. Upon conclusion of the loading operation, the driver and facility personnel inspected the vehicle and determined that a small leak had developed on the bottom barrel of the tank. A containment device was placed under the drip and an alternate tank transporter was mobilized to the site. Upon arrival, the contents on the leaking tank were transferrred to the secodnd transporter. This operation was done without incident and the shipment was released to the driver for transportation to the intended waste management facility. The tank transporter that was found to be leaking was laced out of service and is currently being evaluated for repairs though the estimate to repair the tank is $5000.00. PLease note that the cause of this leak is not believed to be attributed to the material loaded into the transporter. The tank in question was made of a material that was compatible with the flammable liquid being loaded.",The tank in question was in normal service and had not experienced a leak prior to this event.

While offloading at the customer facility, a valve was damaged, which resulted in the release of approximately 75 gallons of free liquid.  MG Waldbaun contained the free liquid with the application of absorbent material to the free liquid.  Environmental Solutions, Inc. of Wakefield, Nebraska was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival, Environmental Solutions, Inc. detected free product and rinse water along the affected concrete lot.  There were no storm drains, waterways, or surface soils affected by the release.  Environmental Solutions, Inc. proceeded to apply absorbent material and floor dry to the affected area, and containerized the spent absorbent material, floor dry, and contaminated snow into eight (8) 55-gallon recovery drums.  The site was secured, pending completion of cleanup during daylight hours on the following day.  Environmental Solutions, Inc. returned to the site on 2/15 to complete the cleanup.  An additional six (6) 55-gallon drums of spent absorbent material were generated.  Fourteen (14) 55-gallon drums of spent absorbent material and floor dry were transported to Waste Express, Inc. in Kansas City, Missouri for incineration.

United States Environmental Services were notified, and said it would be a while before they could respond. When the New Orleans Fire Dept. arrived, they closed the truckway down. When U.S.E.S. arrived, they discovered the liquid line valve, and the vapor line valve leaking. They were able to reseat the liquid line valve, but recommended both valves be changed before the car be moved. The incident Item #07-00643 was closed at 1822.

CELLUCCI,"DIRECTOR, TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",42 Longwater Drive,NORWELL,MA,02061,Carrier,"At approximately 10:30 am on February 10, 2007 a minor release of hazardous waste onto a containment pad occurred from a sift-proof non-DOT Specification closed bulk bin.  At the time of the release, the bulk bin was being unloaded from a  roll-on/roll-off transport vehicle at a less than 10-day storage facility operated by Clean Harbors Environmental Services (CHES) in Deer Park, TX.   While unloading the bin from  the roll-on/roll-off vehicle about 50 gallons of liquid material splashed over the rear gate of the bulk bin.  All of the released material was contained on a concrete pad.    Upon noticing the release, the driver stopped all operations, evacuated the area and notified his supervisor.  An in-house response crew was dispatched and arrived at the scene shortly thereafter.  They retrieved and reviewed the shipping papers and determined that the material in the bulk bin was Hazardous Waste Solid, n.o.s. (Soil contaminated with pentachlorophenol) 9, NA3077, PGIII picked up the previous day at Koppers Industries, Inc., in Tie Plant, MS.   Please note that at the time the material was loaded into the sift-proof bulk bin it was classified as being solid; however, it appears that during the course of transportation a small liquid layer formed on the top of the load.   When the bulk bin was tilted to be unloaded, the liquid layer spilled over the rear gate of the bin.    After reviewing the shipping papers, the response crew utilizing appropriate personal protection equipment and company health and safety policies and procedures entered the containment pad and commenced the clean up operations.  All of the released material was collected using appropriate absorbent materials and placed into appropriate containers for future disposal at a permitted hazardous waste disposal facility.  The cover of the bulk-bin was opened and the load was inspected for presence of any additional liquid.  It was determined that no more liquid remained in the container and it could be safely loaded onto a roll-on/roll-off vehicle for further transportation to the adjoining disposal facility.      The bulk bin was loaded and transported to the facility designated on the shipping papers without any further incidents.","A representative sample of the waste material was collected and sampled by an onsite laboratory to determine if any liquid was present in the material.

THE FRONT TIRES OF V1 WERE TURNED LEFT AS HE WAS PREPARED TO TURN, THE ROAD THERE IS FLAT. A TRACTOR—TRAILER BEHIND V1 IN THE SOUTHBOUND LANE STRUCK V1 FULL SPEED (45 MPH SPEED LIMIT) FROM THE REAR, CAUSING V1 TO MOVE DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE NORTHBOUND LANE, ROLLING V1 TO ITS SIDE ACROSS PART OF THE NORTHBOUND LANE, ROLLING V1 TO ITS SIDE ACROSS PART OF THE NORTHBOUND LANE AND THE GRAVEL DRIVE OF THE DESTINATION. V2 DRIVER SAID HE NEVER APPLIED BRAKES, WAS BLINDED BY THE SUN AND NOT FEELING WELL AND DID NOT SEE THE V1 TRUCK, NO BRAKE MARKS WERE VISIBLE ON THE STREET. AS A PRECAUTION AFTER THE CRASH, V1 DRIVER PLACED A 5-GAL. BUCKET BENEATH THE DOME ROLL—OVER/CONTAINMENT AREA OF THE TANK WHICH WAS BETWEEN THE DOME OF THE TANK AND THE GROUND, AS THE TANK WAS NOT COMPLETELY 180 DEGREES ON ITS SIDE. THIS DOME AREA WAS WET WITH ICE/RAINWATER FROM THE BUCKET, NORMALLY STOWED IN THE DOME AREA, WHICH HAD SPILLED IN THE CRASH. THE LEPC REPLACED THE BUCKET WITH A PLASTIC POOL, IN CASE THE UPRIGHTING OF THE VEHICLE CAUSED LEAKAGE. THE DOME LID WAS INTACT AND TIGHT, THE DRIVER FURTHER TIGHTENED THE DOME BOLTS AS A PRECAUTION. THE TANK WAS BADLY DAMAGED ON THE EXTERIOR FROM THE CRASH. HOWEVER IT IS A TWO-LAYER CONTAINER AND DID NOT LEAK NOR WAS THE INTERGRITY OF THE PRODUCT BREACHED IN ANY WAY. EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL CONDUCTED AIR MONITORING AND 0 PPM WAS RECORDED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS, (ALTHOUGH THE POLICE OFFICER REPORTING THE ""LEAKING"" REPORTED ""A STRONG ODOR""). THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND POLICE DEPARTMENT CLOSED THE HIGHWAY UNTIL THE DAMAGED VEHICLES AND RESPONSE VEHICLES WERE OUT OF THE TRAFFIC LANES. VERTEX PROVIDED A TRAILER AND PUMPED THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE PRODUCT FROM THE DAMAGED TANK INTO THE TRAILER BEFORE THE DAMAGED TANK WAS UPRIGHTED, THE PRODUCT WAS RETURNED TO VERTEX STOCK. NONE WAS SPILLED OR LOST IN THE TRANSFER. VERTEX LATER RETURNED AND TESTED THE GRAVEL AREA OF THE LOCATION BENEATH THE DOME, AND THE SURROUNDING AREA. A PH OF 7 WAS PRESENT THROUGHOUT THE AREA. THE POLICE AND EMERGENCY REPSONSE SUGGEST THAT A LEAK FROM TEH DOME OCCURED. VERTEX TESTED THE TRAILER AND EXAMINED AND TESTED THE SOIL AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO LEAK.

Larry immeditily notified me ( Farrell Kelley) and I notified Mark Kocour, Mark contacted Brentag the distributor of the problem Mark Kocour and I proceeded to the area to do a visual inspection of the truck and the above statement was correct, the dome was sealed and the outlet valve was sealed, neither washout port was sealed. After a conversation with Brentag, Mark agreed that the load could be unloaded after he received the correct paper work from the distributor. After further inspection of the truck the cap on the rear of the truck on the outlet valve was dripping methanol. Dirk Weatherford immoditily placed a bucket under the valve to contain the leak. The truck line was notWyad by Mark Mikkelson, the tanker owner Is sending a tank repair company to repair the leak on site, the truck was rejected and will be sent back to the distributor as soon as leak is repaired.

KACZYNSKI,SAFETY MANAGER,650 Westtown Road,West Chester,PA,19381,Carrier,When unloading freight from trailer material handler discovered a pail that was slightly leaking. The pail was inbetween 2 pallets in the trailer and during the course of transportation the pallets must have shifted somewhat and as a result they slowly crushed the pail until a hole developed and contributed to the unintentional release. The spilled material was cleaned with absorbent and put into a recovery container along with the damaged pail.,"I am not trying to make excuses for what happened with this event, but sometimes we as carriers get kind of set up for failure by the way shipments are tendered to us by shippers. In this particular case the shipper tendered a single pail. As a driver you try to sneak those single container shipments into or inbetween a existing shipment already on the truck to prevent relative motion - most of the time it works but once in awhile it does not work such as this particular event. It becomes very challenging at times though with these types of shipments - maybe if there was some rule that required shippers to palletize all hazmat shipments instead of shipping them as loose containers our drivers would have a easier time and job in being able to secure them other then stuffing them inbetween other shipments.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,A.

Acid continued to pump for a couple minutes into the truck bay. All was contained in truck bay. Wind was from south and fumes dissipated in field going north. As soon a pump was cut off, fire monitor was put on fumes and vapors stopped. Probably a couple hundred gallons of acid was contained in truck bay and was neutralized in sump. At that time the truck driver was in the truck. With a south wind, he was able to exit the truck and move south toward the control room without ever entering the vapors. The driver said the Safeway truck loading nozzle had been worked on that day.    ROOT CAUSES Regulations not followed by Safeway. Wrong Metallurgy (Carbon Steel) was used in the modification of the Dry Connect/Disconnect adapter’s nozzle. This nozzle corroded out during loading of nitric acid. More over, the added extension to the dry connect/disconnect adapter made the trailer less safe because the loading nozzle assembly protruded from the crash box. Furthermore, the added extension to the dry connect/disconnect adapter was spray painted with white color which concealed it carbon steel metalurgy.","1. Discontinue usng Safeway to transport nitric acid for EDN.  2. Review the qualification process for trucking companies and consider using more      qualified personnel for this process.  3.

The TIBR conductor and train crew immediately vacated the area and reported the odor to the local TIBR trainmaster. No injuries were incurred by the TIBR crew. The count sheriff initiated a precautionary evacuation of all residences within one mile and the Tenaha FD. Assisted in this orderly evacuation. A portion of state Highway 59 adjacent to the railyard was also closed. BNSF contract responders found the protective housing cover sealed and cut the seal to check the interior valve housing area. Responders reported finding the B-end liquid valve hissing residue product vapors. The valve was slightly open and it appeared that the valve stem was not seating properly. The responders closed the valve to full closure by 1/4 turn. Responders sprayed tie area with ammonia to test for leakage and discovered the valve stem area was still leaking. The responders then tapped on the valve stem area with a rubber mallet and retested for leakage with an ammonia spray. No further leakage was detected. Responders closed and pinned the protective housing cover; and notified the sheriff that the chlorine vapor release was stopped. The evacuation was ended at approximately 2345 hrs.

GATX 23154 was carefully isolated in the railyard at the fueling tracks above track drip pans. Hazardous material responders from the Pueblo F.D. and the Transportation Technology Center (TTCI) were dispatched to mitigate the product release from GATX 23154. The F.D. responders reported finding the top operated bottom outlet valve (TOBOV) partially open with the operating rod packing gland nut (PGN) only hand tight. The responders closed the TOBOV (3/4 to one full turn) and tool tightened the operating rod’s PGN. This securement was completed by 1535 hrs. MST, 2/26/07, and the leakage from the bottom outlet cap (BOC) stopped. The F.D. responders then checked the BOC. The BOC was 1/8 turn less than tool tight. The BOC was loosened and the accumulated product inside the cap was drained into a recovery tub. With the BOC removed, no leakage from the close bottom outlet was observed. The old BOC gasket was damaged during removal and a new BOC gasket was installed. The BOC was applied and tool tightened. Response was concluded by 1520 hrs.

Load was successfully transferred without further incident.,"In between the annual inspections, our maintenance facilities routinely check the bolts on the internal valve whenever the cargo tank is brought to the shop for servicing.

The driver reported the leak immediately to his supervisor. He was instructed to contain the spill with oil dry absorbent. He did so; Operations Manager was also contacted to coordinate containment and clean-up of the spilled material. It was estimated that approx. 5-10 gallons leaked in 2 areas of the MWSI property. The second area being in front (north) of the West MWSI processing building. The driver did not realize the leak when he was parked in that area as there was a lot of melting snow running off of the truck on that day, consequently the driver moved the truck to the dock/yard area where the leak was noticed. Apparently, a drum of liquid had tipped over onto its side inside the truck resulting in the spill. It was estimated by the driver that this happened as he entered the West driveway of the MWSI property as he drove over a small pile of snow while turning the corner. It was determined that the drum was not properly secured and the driver was disciplined and re-trained on proper load securement of drums. The spilled wastewater liquid contained less than 1 pound of elemental mercury. The spilled liquid and absorbent used were cleaned up by in-house properly trained personnel. The spill was completely contained on the pavement in both areas. Clean-up of the wastewater liquid included the oil dry, brooms and shovels. The duration of the spill clean-up was less than 1 hour. All residuals collected were containerized and managed properly.",Additional load securement training was given to the driver of the truck involved in this spilL.

He immediately notified dispatch, who in turn notified the Safety Manager.  The Safety Manager contacted PSC's ER center, who dispatched Parc Environmental to the scene.  By the time Parc arrived on scene, approximately 5 gallons of the material had spilled onto the asphalt surface of the parking lot.  The balance of the material in the tote was transferred to a sound tote, which was loaded, along with the balance of the shipment, onto a second trailer and transported to the designated facility.  The acidic material on the asphalt was neutralized with calcium hydroxide, the debris placed into drums and manifested to the PSC TSD in Kent, Washington.  The trailer received a gross decontamination and was driven to the PSC TSD in Fernley, NV, where it was further decontaminated, inspected, and returned to service.","Because we believe the container failure was due to deterioration of the material of construction, we now purchase new containers, rather than using reconditioned containers, for this waste stream.
