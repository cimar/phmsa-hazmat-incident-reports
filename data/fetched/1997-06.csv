THE DAMAGED HAZ CARGO CONTAINERS WERE IMMEDIATELY PLACED IN A HAZMAT PROTECTIVE CABINET AT GSE, TO PREVENT FURTHER CONTAMINATION W/ENVIRONMENT. A . IF THE METAL DRUMS HAD BEEN SECURED W/MORE INSULATING MATERIAL TO KEEP EACH DRUM SEPARATED (STYROFOAM OR NEWSPAPER) INSIDE THE WOODEN CRATE, IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE HAZMAT WOULD NOT HAVE LEAKED AND THE ENTIRE INCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED. B. ALSO THERE WERE NO ABSOLUTELY NO MARKINGS ON THE WOODEN CRATE TO INDICATE WHAT WAS INSIDE ESPECIALLY THERE WERE NO HAZMAT MARKINGS, THEY WERE ONLY ON THE INNER DRUMS. ACTION TAKE INCLUDED DADE COUNTY FIRE DEPT HAZMAT TEAM, CHEMTEC AND DADE COUNTY DEPT. OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT WERE NOTIFIED AND THEY RESPONDED QUICKLY. DUE TO THE FACT THAT CONTINENTAL AIRLINES WAS NOT INFORMED THAT THIS SHIPMENT CONTAINED HAZ-MATERIAL AND NO MSDS WAS PROVIDED BY THE SHIPPER, THE HAZ MATERIAL WAS NOT IDENTIFIED UNTIL SOME 20 HOURS LATER WHEN CONTINENTAL AIRLINES WAS ABLE TO RECEIVE A FAX OF THE MSDS FROM THE ACTUAL MANUFACTURER OF THE SPILL PRODUCT IN ITALY.

THE DRIVER APPARENTLY WAS EXCEEDING A SPEED SAFE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE TURN.  THE CARGO TANK WAS LOADED WITH 8500 GALLONS OF GASOLINE.  APPROXIMATELY 1000 GALLONS OF GASOLINE WAS SPILLED THROUGH A PUNCTURE IN THE CARGO TANK.  THE GASOLINE WAS ABSORBED INTO THE SOIL AND SOME RUNOFF WENT INTO STORM DRAINS WHICH DISCHARGED INTO DUHART CREEK.

SINCE THE CARGO OF GASOLINE WAS LEAKING DURING THIS ENTIRE TIME WE FEEL THE SEVERITY OF THE CONTAMINATION WAS WORSENED. THE ACCIDENT SCENE AND SURROUNDING AREAS WERE NO MORE STABLE AT 1100 HOURS THAN TWO HOURS PREVIOUSLY, BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING LEAK.

I ASKED HER FOR THE EXACT LOCATION OF THIS INCIDENT, AND PROMPTLY CALLED THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF OHIO HAZMAT DIVISION TO REPORT THE INCIDENT.  I SPOKE TO DAN FISHER AND GAVE HIM MY CONTACT NUMBER, AND INFORMED HIM OF THE CONTENTS AND CAPACITY  OF THE TANK.  I THEN NOTIFIED OUR DISPATCH DEPARTMENT AS TO WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE.  AND DIRECTED OUT OTHER DRIVER FOR THE COLUMBUS AREA TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE ACCIDENT SCENE AND OFFER ASSISTANCE. THE NUCO2 BULK TRUCK WAS ATTEMPTING TO MERGE ONTO I-71 IN DOWNTOWN COLUMBUS FROM I-670.  WHILE MAKING A LANE CHANGE THE TRAFFIC IN THE LANE HE WAS GOING INTO STOPPED SUDDENLY.  THE DRIVER APPLIED HIS BRAKES CAUSING HIS TRUCK TO SKID SIDEWAYS, RESULTING IN OUR TRUCK STRIKING THE REAR END OF THE SEMI-TRAILER THAT WAS STOPPED IN THE LANE IN FRONT OF OUR TRUCK.  AT THE MOMENT OF IMPACT,  THE STEERING COLUMN SEPARATED.  THEN THE TRUCK PROCEEDED OUT OF CONTROL AND CAME TO REST AGAINST A CONCRETE GUARD RAIL.  THE DRIVER RELEASED HIS SEATBELT AND JUMPED OUT OF THE TRUCK. THEN THE TRUCK CAUGHT FIRE. I RECEIVED A CALL A SHORT LATER FROM OUR OTHER DRIVER IN THE COLUMBUS AREA, INFORMING ME FROM THE ACCIDENT SCENE THAT THE FIRE WAS OUT, THE LIQUID CO2 FLOW HAD BEEN CONTAINED, AND THAT THE TRUCK WAS BEING TOWED.  I DISCOVERED LATER DURING AN INTERVIEW WITH DRIVER OF THE TRUCK INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT, THAT HE HAD BEEN DRIVING HIS TRUCK WITH CO2 SUPPLY VALVE TO THE HOSE REEL IN THE OPEN POSITION.  WHEN THE FIRE FROM THE TRUCK REACHED THE HOSE REEL, IT MELTED THE FILL GUN, AND ALLOWED LIQUID CO2 TO FLOW UNCONTROLLED FROM THE HOSE.  I HAVE SENT A MEMO OUT TO ALL PERSONNEL IN THE OPERATIONS DIVISION OF THE COMPANY TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEY: *WATCH FOR THEIR FOLLOWING DISTANCE  * ALWAYS SHUT OFF THE HOSE REEL SUPPLY VALVE AND BLOW DOWN THE HOSE REEL BEFORE MOVING THEIR TRUCK FROM ON ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER.  THIS WILL PREVENT A CO2 RELEASE LIKE THE ONE THAT OCCURRED.  IT WILL ALSO PROLONG THE LIFE OF THE HOSE AND THE SAFETY RELIEF VALVES ON THE FILL LINE. *ALWAYS WEAR THEIR SEATBELTS.  IT THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK IN THE ACCIDNET HADN'T BEEN WEARING HIS SEATBELT,  HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THROWN THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  IN THIS INSTANCE, HE WALKED AWAY FROM THE ACCIDNET.
