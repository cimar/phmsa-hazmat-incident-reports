The loading arm and spout was left attached to railcar ACFX 75329 so that the arm could drain completely while the loaders tended to other railcars.  At 11:50 the tankfield Unit Operator (head operator) called the loaders on the radio and notified them that they had lost suction on the High Sulfur Diesel tank and a new tank was being set to them.  Immediately after the radio call the loaders witnessed a large air bubble and splash of product coming from the dome of railcar ACFX 75329.  They quickly checked the railcar, noticed it was overfilled and verified that the loading valve was blocked.  The valve was leaking and continued to fill the railcar slowly from the time it was originally blocked in.  The loaders notified the Lead Carloader and their Supervisor who then requested a vacuum truck and instructed the loaders to place some 5 gallon cans under the railcar to catch any spillage.  Tankfield operators were notified and an additional valve upstream of the loading rack was blocked in to help stop the flow of product.  HSDSL continued to escape from the dome as the railcar heated up in the sun (product expansion) and the loading arm valve continued to leak.  Approximately 3 gallons of HSDSL was spilled onto the bare soil.  The vacuum truck arrived on the scene at 12:10 and promptly removed the excess product from the railcar, the 5 gallon cans, and the spill on the ground.",A new valve has been ordered to replace the leaking one.

GATX 93666 was standing in a yard/industry track awaiting placement into the consignee’s facility for unloading. This location was adjacent to the property owner whom notified CHEMTREC of this venting event. GATX 93666 was venting from the functioning pressure relief device (PRD). Ambient daytime temperatures had been above 100 degrees F for several days. BNSF contacted the consignee and requested that some product inside GATX 93666 be reduced to allow for additional product expansion from high daytime temperatures until GATX 93666 could be fully unloaded. Consignee transferred approximately 10,000 gallons of product from GATX 93666 into tanker trucks by 0100 hrs. MDT, 8/03/06 without further incident. No further venting was reported from GATX 93666 afterwards. GATX 93666 was placed into consignee’s facility for further unloading on 8/04/06.   In the early evening hours on 8/03/06, CHEMTREC was again notified by a local resident of a venting tank car at the aforementioned location. GATX 78009 was reported venting intermittently from the PRD. GATX 78009 was shipped under the same billing as GATX 93666. Local BNSF supervision was notified and GATX 78009 was then scheduled to be immediately placed into the consignee’s facility for unloading. BNSF notified the shipper to inspect all their shipments awaiting unloading at this Arizona facility. On 8/04/06, the shipper reported that the average liquid temperature of these tank cars of LPG awaiting unloading were at 101 degrees F. These tank cars were loaded at an average liquid temperature of 81 degrees F.

While exiting the pipeline, his tanker disconnected from the truck and caught fire. Most of the 8500 gallons burned in the fire. A small amount of gas leaked into the storm sewer system and drained into a nearby creek.     Police, fire, and containment crews were on hand in less than 5 minutes (no police report or fire report was given to Howes Oil.) The gasoline in the creek was contained and cleaned up. Testing of water showed no contaminants are present.    The total cost for cleanup, response, and property damages are not known at this time (and may not be known within the 30 day deadline for this report to be filed.) The estimated cost of loss material and carrier damage was listed in this report.",It would be helpful if there were a product available that Carriers could purchase and install on either their semi-trucks or tanker trailers that would notify a driver if his trailer was not properly hooked up to the truck's fifth wheel.

He scaled in and following company policy drove to the assigned dock, that being B dock to unload. After unloading he was then instructed to go to a dock to load 99% sulfuric acid. The driver first hooked up the nitrogen line to pressure up the trailer and also he grounded the trailer for safety procedures. He then hooked up the unloading line to the trailer, opened the one unloading valve on the trailer, and then drew a sample thru the sample recovery valve. Driver then turned on unloading pump to unload. The driver has done this enough times he knows how many minutes to leave the nitrogen on arid then turn off to then start to vent trailer. This he did and in the length of time it normally takes to do this procedure he said the unloading line shook indicating the trailer was empty. He then unhooked, washed down and went to A dock to load. Driver then hooked the correct loading line, hooked vent line to vent since it is a contained unit,, reset loading meter, turned pump on. Driver then went down to change the placards when he noticed acid coming out the ‘pop off valve on top of the trailer. At this time he turned off the pump and notified Marsulex personal. Upon arrival at spill site they then observed another spill area being at the’ scrubber’ site. The scrubber had ruptured and split. Soda ash was applied to the area, 33 bags. The driver was then instructed to weigh out to see how much the trailer and truck weighed. It was found to be 81,300 lbs. His weights coming in were GROSS 73140, TARE 29400, NET 43640. The trailer is a 3600 gallon tank, when he shut off the pump it registered 713 gallons. The reason for the spill is that in the unloading procedure the driver forgot to open Marsulex line valve. NO product was pumped off. Fresh acid was loaded on top of the spent all ready in the trailer causing it to over flow thru the pressure relief valve and back up thru the venting scrubber.   EXPLAINATION;   The hose shook because when the line was hooked to the trailer there was naturally ally air trapped in the line between the trailer valve and the line valve. Trailer valve was opened and some spent acid went into unload line and compressed the air. When the trailer vented down the spent then receded back into the trailer due to equalization of pressure and the hose shook showing a sign of being empty. This total procedure took about 50 minutes between unloading and loading and the spill.   A cleanup company was called in to clean and neutralize the area which was about fifteen feet by fifteen feet. Unit was available for use the next day. NO injuries were occurred.",Actions taken to prevent recurrence is that it has not been standard operating procedures to scale out for an empty or tare weight between unloading and reloading acid. ]f this had been required the driver would of noticed the difference of weight and knew something was wrong which he should have noticed when he moved the truck to change from B rack to A rack. This is now required operating procedure. Marsulex and Roeder Cartage Safety Department will soon begin coordinating refresher training on all procedures.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,6000,,US,

THERE WAS VERY LITTLE PRODUCT SPILLED THE HOLE WAS SO SMALL THAT IT SEALED ITSELF AT SOME POINT ONCE WE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO HANDLE THE PRODUCT WE THEN REMOVED ALL OTHER FREIGHT FROM THE TRAILER AND PLACED THE BED DRUM IN A RECOVERY DRUM AND PLACED IN AS&D.  I DO NOT THE DURATION OF THE RELEASE BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT A ½ GAL THAT WAS RELEASED.,I BELIEVE THAT THIS DAMAGE WAS DONE AT THE SHIPPERS WITH THE FOLK LIFT ATTACHMENT THAT ARE USED TO PICK UP DRUMS EVERY DRUM THAT WAS ON THAT SHIPMENT MARKINGS ON THEM ABOUT 2 IN DOWN FROM THE RIM OF THE DRUMS.

Transportation of 22 degree baume hydrochloric delivery to consignee made without problem.  Consignee attendant departed unload area.    Trailer was pressurized after hooking up to consignee tank, with 3-way valve set to vent into consignee tank and when unloading was begun, condensation of vapor became visible from exhaust hose of trailer.  Driver stopped the process immediately, hand tightened 3-way valve to the exhaust hose, began unload without additional vapor visible.    Consignee attendant returned due to visible vapor, advised driver to depressurize trailer, which released very visible vapors as is normal.  Consignee then tightened the dome bolts with heavy pipe wrench, causing one dome bolt to 'bottom out' on the dome lid brace, bending the brace.  When repressurized, consignee not satisfied with dome lid seal.

As a result one of the 55-gallon drums of resin aboard the trailer was creased and approximately 10 gallons of resin was released onto the trailer floor, and one gallon of that migrated onto the asphalt below.  At approximately 2:57 pm, KLLM Transport Services retained Cura Emergency Services (CES) to manage the environmental clean up operations. The CES incident manger contacted the driver of the vehicle to obtain additional information. The driver of the vehicle had turned the temperature of the trailer down, and placed a bucket under the trailer where the material was migrating to the asphalt. These measures prevented the material from migrating farther than it could have. Based on the information provided the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from Environmental Management Services(EMS) to perform the corrective actions. The crew from EMS arrived onsite and assessed the scope of the release. The crew began corrective actions by deploying absorbent materials to the asphalt where the resin had migrated. The absorbents were worked in with brooms and placed into a drum. The material on the trailer floor had congealed due to the low temperatures. This required the response team to hand scrape the rivets on the trailer floor to remoe the gelled resin. The material was placed into the drum as well. The crew then utilized absorbent pads to remove the residue left behind from the gel. The damaged drum was over packed and placed into an over pack drum. The non-damaged drums were secured in the trailer, along with the two over pack drums.  On August 22, 2006, the driver of the tractor-trailer returned to the road after his required sleep. It was arranged for the drums to be dropped off at a facility in Des Moines, IA called Hydro-Kleen. They will processes and disposed of the two over pack drums.

An estimated one gallon of UN1866 Polymer was leaking from a 55-gallon drum.  On August 24, 2006, at approximate 1:03 p.m. CDT, Cura Emergency Services (CES) was contacted by KLLM Transport Services to manage clean up operations following the discovery of the release. The local fire department first responded to the site and made first entry in the trailer. Fire department personnel located one 55-gallon drum of polymer resin laying on its side, leaking its contents. The drum was uprighted to stop the leakage. Based on the information given, CES retained a crew from Grones Environmental to perform a site assessment and complete clean up operations. A crew from Grones mobilized to the site and absorbed the material that had leaked out of the trailer. The drum had suffered a puncture on its side near the top of the drum.

Apria employee Mike Berkley was in the area and heard the release. He immediately contacted his supervisor Ryan Decker. Decker went to the stand tank and due to the amount of liquid escaping from the tank and the fog it produced deemed it unsafe for him to approach the tank to attempt to close the valves. The emergency plan was implemented. At approximately 1050 hours, notification was made to the Pike Township Fire Department, Corporate Transportation Safety Management, and facility management. The area was secured from vehicular and pedestrian traffic and an evacuation was implemented with Apria employees as well as the two adjacent businesses, I.H.I. and M.K.M. Distribution.    At approximately 1055 hours the first responders from the fire department arrived. The fire department Hazmat team took charge of the operation. They were advised that there was approximately 2500 gallons of Oxygen, refrigerated liquid in the tank. Telephonic contact was made with Matthew Nolting, MedO2, the  LOX supplier. Once the Hazmat team spoke with him they advised that the area should remain secured and the tank allowed to drain until it was empty.    At approximately 1310 hours Incident Commander Donald Blackwell advised that the oxygen content in the building were at safe levels and the evacuation was terminated. The scene was released and the fire department left the area.    Inspection of the tank revealed that a pipe fitting failed on a discharge line.    There were no injuries or collateral damage. The LOX evaporated and there was no clean up required. The stand tank was placed out of service pending repairs and inspection by the contracted maintenance/repair company.    The stand tank was manufactured by Minnesota Valley Engineering, Inc., in 1981, serial #105, National Board #4434.

The freight was stacked on pallets and black shrink wrap was used. It was impossible to see the freight that was actually loaded on the pallets because of the black shrink wrap, the black shrink wrap did have the markings and labels required for the Aerosols 2.2 that were inside of the black shrink wrap but there was no indication of any other hazards inside of the shrink wrap either on the paperwork or by the markings and labels. This freight was moved by vessel on the ocean from New Jersey to Puerto Rico. Upon arrival to the terminal in Puerto Rico, a liquid was noticed leaking out of the back of the container. The container was opened and the pallets with the black shrink wrap were leaking. Suspecting that the material was non-hazardous since all the liquid on the pallets was supposed to be non-hazardous, the terminal began breaking down the skids to discover that most of the 5-gallon pails on the skid contained DOT Corrosive Liquid. A hazmat team had to be called out to the terminal to handle the clean up. In the end, none of the corrosive pails leaked, all the pails that actually leaked were documented as being the non-hazardous cleaning compounds.","In numerous phone calls, emails, and faxes to the shipper since this spill, this shipper is still very unfamiliar with the requirements on shipping hazardous materials.

Approximately 3 gallons of product leaked from a plug on an unused port from the IBC. The IBC had a plastic bag on the top and the bag was stretch-wrapped to the IBC.  However, the IBC design does not allow the bag to be tight to the top and would not prevent the plug from backing out.  Since the plug was found on the floor of the trailer on arrival it is assumed that the plug backed out and fell out due to heavy vibration/movement during transit from the carrier's Rialto terminal to the final destination in Temecula.    An IRC emergency response team assembled to clean-up the minor spill. The plug cap was replaced and tightened on the IBC.","Our fill operators routinely check visually to verify the plug is flush with the top of the tote. As a corrective action, we have revised our fill procedures to tighten the seal plug to the manufacturers' recommended torque spec of 10 ft/lbs on every fill.

BNSF responders inspected ACFX 73462 the morning of 8/29 after placing a catch receptacle under this tank car. Responders reported finding the closure cap to the liquid eduction line loose and it was tool tightened slowing the leak. BNSF contract responders arrived afterwards and inspected the closure cap finding no sealing material on either the closure cap or eduction pipe threads. Contract responders applied Teflon tape onto the threads, reapplied the closure cap and tool tightened the cap. No further leakage evident after closure cap secured. Responders then checked the fill hole. The fill hole securement and its gasket were good. The product outage was checked and it was approximately six inches which equated to a little more than a 2% outage. A vacuum truck that was ordered previously to this location (in case product reduction was necessary) was not used and released after responders concluded that ACFX 73462 was not overfilled.

The product splashed onto the tank car shell and the ground. The ground impact of the product resulted in a small flare-up of flame atop the ground which soon burned out. Railcar movement was immediately stopped when the BNSF crew noticed the flame flare-up on the ground. The local F.D. was called to eliminate fire threats and monitor the remediation process. A BNSF mechanical-hazardous material responder inspected UTLX 200589 and reported finding all 8 manway securement swing bolts hanging (not applied). The BNSF responder applied and properly tool tightened all the manway securement bolts. The liquid eduction line valve was closed, but an unloading fitting (reducer) was still applied on this valve and the protective housing cover was down (not closed). Responder removed this fitting, flanged capped the eduction line and closed the protective housing cover over this valve. Apparently, the unloader for the consignee was in the process of unloading product from UTLX 200589 and failed to resecure the manway cover when the unloading process was stopped or interrupted.

SFTZ 220569 was deramped and immediately taken to the containment area. Plastic sheeting was placed under SFTZ 220569. Inspection by BNSF contract responders found lading stacked to the trailer’s ceiling and much of the lading had to be removed to get to the leak source. Responders found seven 5 gallon poly pails of a corrosive catalyst had been damaged during a load shift. The pails were loaded on a pallet with several heavy industrial type vehicle tires placed unsecured atop this pallet. During transit movement the heavy tires shifted causing the pallet of pails to collapse and topple over. Of the seven damaged pails, four were dented and cracked at the pail bottom and lost all product inside the pails. The other three pails were dented but did not leak. Also, one 55 gallon drum of non-hazardous resin was found and had lost a small amount of product due to a stress fracture from drum rotation during transit. The lading inside the trailer was sorted and decontaminated and this lading was picked-up by the consignee (UPS Freight). The intermodal rail flatcar deck and the inside of SFTZ 220569 were cleaned. All damaged pails and the 55 gallon drum were placed inside 85 gallon recovery drums and returned inside SFTZ 220569 along with the remainder of the lading that wasn’t impacted by any spillage. All the waste materials were bagged and also placed inside SFTZ 220569.  During the initial phases of discovery and clean-up, one box of Sodium Chlorate, UN 1495 was found inside SFTZ 220569 by a ERA Inspector and the contract responders. This package was listed as a Limited Quantity on the shipping papers found inside  the trailer, but was not included on the rail waybill.

The cause was the mechanical failure of a blown gasket on the suction line of the truck.  The driver immediately shut off the valves and put down booms and pads to contain the spill.  The spill crossed the road on Highway 1087 into the ditch line.  Two Refinery personnell in the vacinity were dispatched with cleanup supplies that they put down as soon as they arrived onsite.  Somerset Environmental Services, Inc. was dispatched at 7:50 a.m. to respond for cleanup.  SES personnell arrived onsite at 10:00 a.m. and immediately began putting down more oil dry and and sweeping the road getting it dry and sweeping up the oil dry from the road.  Smith Oil Field Services arrived on the site at 10:35 a.m. with a dump truck load of clean rock. They immediately began cleaning the loading area and shoulder of the road and loading the contaminated dirt and rock into the dump truck. There was 8.22 ton of soil and rock disposed of at Laurel Ridge Landfill.  Seed and straw was spread on the edge of the road way for reseeding the excavated area.  The State Highway department put down sand and swept it off the road after SOS had cleaned the shoulder of the road.","South Kentucky Purchasing has conducted an interview with the driver to determine the cause of the accident.  The driver was not at fault.  It was determined that the drivers should be trained in determining when to report a spill immediately to the proper authorties therfore, making them first responders.

The driver was traveling north on NC Hwy 27 near Lincolnton, NC when the truck left the road surface on the right side after rounding a curve, collided with a utility pole, overturned, caught fire and exploded, causing release of the gasoline.

The valve and cylinder parted resulting in an unknown amount of oxygen, compressed being released.     Apria Healthcare Transfill Technician Santana Robinson was operating the transfill process and had just completed his leak and temperature check, the pressure was slightly over 1500 psi when he heard an explosion. John Woodall, Senior Transfill Technician beat him to the controls and immediately shut down the fill process. Once the pressure was shut off and the separated pig tail stopped flopping around they proceeded to start closing the valves on the remaining cylinders.     As they were closing the valves they found that a D tank, which was filling on the third row from the top of the rack, had separated from the pigtail and was on the floor. The cylinder was found on the floor on the opposite side of the room from where it had been on the rack. The valve was not in the cylinder when found. The valve was found on the floor with the quick-connect still attached. A cinder block on the wall next to the fill rack showed evidence of where the cylinder impacted and on the drywall on the opposite wall was dented. The bottom of the cylinder was buckeled, where it would have hit the cinder block wall. Placing a D tank against the dented drywall, the dent is consistent with the valve not being attached to the cylinder when it hit. The cylinder and valve were quarantined.    The cylinder that failed was part of a shipment of new cylinders that had just been received. The remaining cylinders from the shipment were blown down and placed back in the shipping box and quarantined.    The incident resulted in an unknown amount of oxygen, compressed being released. There were no injuries or damage other than to the walls.","The failed cylinder and valve were sent to RSI Associates, LLC, 1652 Victory Court, Prospect, KY for examination. The report of the finding by Garland Scot will be forwarded to Pacific Cylinders (The Respiratory Group) and to Wayne Chaney, U.S. DOT, PHMSA upon receipt.

Driver was loading on the curb side of tanker. Upon commencing the tanker pump, driver enters his vehicle to complete paperwork. At some point, the driver notices crude flowing on the ground surface past his truck. He exits the cab and shuts off pump. Crude was flowing out the vapor tube on the downhill side of tanker (flood loading) . Driver notifies Brietburn Energy site personnel of the release. Brietburn immediately dispatches a backhoe to the scene and evaluates the size an impacted areas. Brietburn determines the spill is large and requires outside resources to assist with containment and remediation. Brietburn implements their SPCC plan and notifies their spill response contractor to respond and assist. Upon further evaluation, crude has entered into the onsite storm drain and is found in the flood control channel 1.5 miles down stream from where the incident occurred. A dump truck load of sand is placed at this location to stop the spread and Brietburn dispatches two vacuum trucks to the location for crude recovery. At 1200 hours, private response company (Patriot Environmental) arrives at the spill location.  ***See Attached Sheet for Additional Information***","Flying J Transportation immediately conducted an investigation as to the cause of release. The transportation driver violated the following corporate policies: 1) Violated loading procedures (Flood loading of tank); 2) Violation of DOT and EPA regulations (Failure to connect vapor recovery hose) and 3) Violation of DOT regulations (Failure to monitor equipment and vehicle during loading operations). Flying J Transportation has a strict policy for failure follow loading and unloading policies. Each driver is trained and tested in these procedures.    Due to this incident, all bulk drivers will be refreshed on corporate policies and procedures for loading and unloading. They will be advised to the type of damages (both environmental and financial) caused by the lack of following those put in place to prevent such accidents from occurring.    Based on site photographs, the spread of this spill could have been prevented if the site engineered more efficient and/or had spill control devices in and around the loading areas.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,250593,"FLYING J TRANSPORTATION, LLC",US,

The rollover ended with the truck/trailer coming to rest on the passenger side. At the time of discovery by the Texas Department of Public Safety, immediate rescue of the driver was accomplished; the driver was transported from the scene by ambulance due to injuries. The cargo tank rupture allowed crude oil to leak onto the barrow ditch area of the roadway. The Big Lake, TX Fire Department HazMat team contained the spill using containment booms, absorbents and soil. Duration of the spill was approximately one hour. The cargo tank rupture was a circumferential break in the upper passenger side quadrant of the tank shell, approximately 10’ forward of the rear bulkhead, approximately 18” in length, and 1” in width at its widest point.

Shortly thereafter, shipper and Union Tank Car (UTC) representatives responded and were at the incident site. Responders broke the seal on the valve protective housing cover to inspect the top fittings. The inspection revealed that the leak source was the 3-inch top loading valve/threaded liquid valve that was cross-threaded on its threaded pipe nipple. Responders relieved the internal pressure within this tank car and the product release ebbed. The liquid valve was tool tightened 1/4 turn to end the product release. The product outage within UTLX 202080 was checked and deemed appropriate. Shipper responders began remediation of all spillage. The UTC responder removed the liquid valve and recut the pipe nipple threads that were galled. The liquid valve was inspected and deemed mechanically fit. Teflon tape was applied to the newly rethreaded pipe nipple and a new liquid valve was applied and tool tightened. UTLX 202080 was returned to the origin shipper facility to perform a thorough inspection all other valves and fittings prior to releasing it in transportation.",Ensure shipper’s pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,660,BNSF RAILWAY COMPANY,US,

As the truck was being loaded I did the normal end of day shutdown checks then went to the office to get driver Dave Debone directions for his next day’s delivery. I was also training a new employee, Bill Sittler, who began asking some questions about the internet training he was undergoing. Since I had been on duty for more than 11 hours with no help and had done the end of day routine, I forgot that there was a truck being loaded and left the facility to go home. This occurred due to fatigue. At 11:45 PM  8-21  I received a phone call from Preston Grow of Horsehead Corp. secutrity. He stated Ernie Miller of  Horsehead Corp. detected strong ammonia odors from the Airgas facility. At 12:15 AM I arrived at the facility to investigate. I discovered strong odors, a running loading pump and a spill under the the truck I was loading the previous day. I then notified regional manager Tom Hobaugh.  The truck was overfilled and product discharged through the pressure relief valve. Later calculations determined that 3900 gallons of aqua ammonia where spilled to the ground.  I began fogging the area with water to bring down the odors so the pump could be shut down and secure the affected area.  When ordors where at an acceptable level and I could reach the office,  approximately 1 AM,  I made reporting calls to the LEPC, SERC and NRC agencies.  I informed LEPC that no emergency sevices were needed and the situation was under control.  Some time later James Kunkle of  DEP and Rory Koons of the Aquashicola fire dept arrived.  There was concern ammonia may have gotten to the Aquashicola Creek.  Rory Koons tested Airgas outfall with litmus paper and stated the results were negative.  Butch Kocher and myself tested the outfall on  8-22-06 and also got negative test results. I was visited by Scott Confer of DEP on  8-22-06 to discuss the situation.  He stated we should test the outfall each day for 2 weeks and report the results to him.     Recommendations:   1.

Upon inspection of cargo by U.S Customs, they found one fibreboard box containing 2 car batteries. U.S Customs brought this to my attention. I then notified Jeff Lyter, Air General Director of Safety and Security, Neil Burge, British Airways Area Customer Service Manager and Jim McCaffrey, British Airways VP Safety and Compliance.   I then left several messages with the FAA office in MIA to report what we had found. Special Agent Mark Gentile of the FAA office in Orlando made a visit to our facility. I explained the details and he took copies of all the paperwork regarding this shipment and also took pictures. He then said he would follow up on it and that I could forward the rest of the shipment to its final destination of Atlanta, GA.

The police officer alerted our driver that the lugger box he was transporting was leaking. After assessing the situation, it was determined that during transport, liquid had separated from the sludge material that was being transported. The liquid material then worked its way out of the lugger box between the small gap of the tarp and the top of the box. As the material made its way out, it dripped down the side of the lugger box and onto the bed of the truck.    The material being transported in the lugger box was pickling bath sludge from the production of stainless steel that carried an F006 EPA hazardous waste code. The waste is profiled as containing zero free liquids.    The driver contacted his dispatcher and the transportation manager. Calls were made to both the National Response Center (NRC case # 808854) and the WDNR spill hotline.    A Veolia response team was then dispatched to assist the driver. Once onsite, the response team pumped all free liquids from the lugger box into a tanker truck. Oil dry was then added to the lugger box to absorb any additional liquids that might separate while in transit. In addition, all free liquid was wiped from the side of the lugger box and truck bed. The debris on the ground was also absorbed and swept up with all solids being placed back into the lugger box.    Although it is difficult to determine the exact amount of material that was released, we have estimated that a maximum of 5 gallons of liquid spilled from the lugger box. It is believed that the actual amount spilled was considerably less. Because of this uncertainty, Veolia ES took a conservative approach and a call was made to the NRC because the RQ for F006 is 10 pounds.","To prevent any recurrences, future shipments of this material will be checked for liquids prior to loading and shipping.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,700,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, L.L.C.",US,

However, the tank car was coupled to PLMX 135528, which was leaking vapor from the pressure relief device. A pressure gauge was placed on a device and it tested at 100 Lbs. of pressure. Further inspection determined that the 0-Rings were deteriorated. US Environmental personnel changed the 0-rings and secured the tank car from further leak.

The general car foreman inspected the car at the customer’s facility and reported that the B-end slope sheet on the end compartment was corroded through. CSXT hazardous material department notified the shipper, Terra Nitrogen Corp. of the incident via CHEMTREC (report # 08152006043). CSXT responded an emergency response contractor to plug the hole in the car’s slope sheet and to initiate the cleanup of the released product. Agricultural Services advised that they would unload the car and recover the product that was released on their property. The contractor recovered approximately 3 tons of product that had been released from the car in CSXT’s yard and in the track from the yard to the consignee’s facility.
