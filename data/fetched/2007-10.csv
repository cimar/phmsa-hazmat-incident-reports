Product was noted to be sodium hypochlorite (12.5% solution), due to characteristic odor.  The rear of the trailer was opened and an IBC of sodium hypochlorite was found to be leaking from a small crack in the body just above the valve.  Approximately 30 gallons of product leaked from the IBC.  10 gallons were recovered in 5 gallon pails placed near the leak.  Approximately 15 gallons of the spilled material remained in the trailer and captured by spill absorbent material.  Approximately 5 gallons of product leaked from the trailer was caught by absorbent material placed in the customer's paved parking area below the leak.  Two employees were sent from the terminal to assist the driver with handling the incident.  The remaining product in the damaged IBC was transferred into another clean IBC.  The employees then cleaned up spilled material the trailer and the parking area.  The incident lasted approximately 3 hours.","It is unknown how the crack occurred in the IBC.  The container was filled, stored, loaded without any leakage noted.  It was only noted at the first stop of the day for the driver.  So we surmise that the crack was made at some point in the container's past and only leaked due to the movement associated with the trip from the terminal to the customer location on this trip.  The crack was small and inside of the valve housing area of the tote making a visual identification of the leak difficult without removing the bottle from the frame.  Totes are inspected prior to filling, but this damage was missed.  The incident will be reviewed with operations employees (including drivers).",No,IBC,"Composite, with plastic inner liner, for liquids",31HH1,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA Inc.,US,

After standing the drum back upright, the receiving person at Precision Cast Parts provided a PH test strip and the liquid on the top was tested and determined to be a small amount (< 1 oz.) of Sulfuric Acid.  Upon further investigation, the bung was found to have been punctured in the center at some time -- as if for venting purposes, and was then re-used in error on the full drum of Sulfuric.    The customer had empties they were returning of the same product, so the driver replaced the bung with a good one, cleaned the top of the drum and delivered it to the customer.  Less than an ounce of product leaked on the top of the drum, and 2 drops hit the drivers boot -- no other spillage lost, and no injuries or damage were involved.","Drum preparation process includes checking bungs and seals/gaskets; the inspection includes a check for bung integrity -- holes, threads, etc.  Ensure that the entire process is being followed and no short-cuts are taken during busy times.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA Inc.,US,

Crew notified Morrisville (PA) Yardmaster, who in turn notified CR's S.T.O. and CR's Mgr. Risk Mgmt., A. Richter.    Conrail's emergency response contractor, REACT Environmental, Inc., was dispatched to the yard to investigate and mitigate.  Also assistance from customer representative, Basic Chemical Solutions, to which the car was being delivered.    Further inspection found eight of eight (8/8) liquid line mounting flange securement nuts/bolts not even hand tight; and, four of four (4/4) air line mounting flange securement nuts/bolts not even hand tight.  It was noted by both REACT and the customer representative that all twelve (12) bolts were made of stainless steel, but all nuts to secure same to flanges were of carbon steel.    All 12 securement nuts had to be strenuously worked to get them to operate as intended, due to the high level of corrosion due to incompatibility.  As the car was in the yard directly outside the intended customer's plant, the all nuts were resecured and made tool tight, so that the car could be moved without further incident into the plant.  Customer representative advised the securement nuts found on the car would be replaced after the car was unloaded and prior to shipment back out.      Car was also wiped down and decontaminated to safe levels (between 6-8 on pH scale) prior to Conrail moving the car into the plant.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Consolidated Rail Corporation,US,

The Tri-State Motor Transit Co. driver contained the release using paper towels.  H2O Environmental Technology, Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada was dispatched to investigate the trailer, and perform the remainder of the cleanup.    H2O Environmental Technology, Inc. investigated the trailer and discovered one (1) leaking 55-gallon drum.  Apparently, the release occurred as a result of a faulty seam on the drum.  Approximately 15 gallons of free product were released.  H2O Environmental Technology, Inc. applied absorbent material to contain the free liquid inside of the trailer.  The leaking drum was placed into a 85-gallon over-pack drum and left on the trailer for disposition.  The contaminated absorbent material was placed into one (1) 55-gallon drum and left on the trailer for disposition.

A CSXT train master inspected the area and advised that he could smell a slight chlorine odor within three car lengths of the car.  Greenup County 911, Weavertown Environmental and SPSI (CSXT Contractors) were all notified to respond. Five CSXT personnel reported effects from exposure to the product and were treated and released from a local hospital. At 06:42 CSXT was notified that the local fire chief had initiated a shelter in place advisory for the towns of Raceland and Russell, KY. At CSXT was notified the a fire department responder has fallen from the rail car to the ground, and was taken by ambulance to the local hospital for treatment.  Fire department personnel reported that they cut the seal off of the protective housing and closed all four valves a  of a turn. At 09:00 the shelter in place was lifted. Weavertown personnel then made entry to check that the 4 valves were secured. They found three plugs loose about 1 turn and one plug was loose 1  turns. SPSI arrived at 11:00 to investigate the release. Upon boarding the car the pressure was checked, 128 psi. The valves and plugs were checked for tightness.

He called me right away, and we assured that there was noone, or nothing down wind that would be affected.  We then got a transfer hose and another empty tank next to the damaged tank and transferred the liquid into the good nurse wagon.  Once it was done we uprighted the tank, and bleed off the vapor.  The whole time this was going on, my supervisor traveled around the section, to ensure there was no adverse effects down wind.  When the pressure in the tank dropped, it released the excess flow valve on the damaged discharge valve, release the liquid reported.  We watched as the liquid evaporated, and once it was done, we loaded the trailer onto a flatbed and hauled to our shop.","There wasn't any one thing that we could find that was done wrong.

Upon the discovery of the release, a compatible container was placed under the trailer to collect any material being released.  The regional manager was immediately notified and a sub-contracted response crew was dispatched to identify the source of release and to initiate all necessary corrective actions.    Upon arrival, the response crew reviewed the shipping papers and donned appropriate protective equipment prior to entering the trailer.  Once inside the trailer, the response crew determined that the cause of the release was attributed to a 55-gallon non-bulk package containing Waste Corrosive Liquid Acidic, Inorganic n.o.s. that appeared to have pressurized and developed a small tear at the upper portion of the seam.  It is estimated that about 10 gallons of the corrosive liquid had escaped from the package with about 1 quart leaking from the trailer onto gravel below.  The leaking container was placed into a suitable salvage drum, and all of the released liquid was cleaned up utilizing compatible absorbent materials and pads.  The contaminated absorbent and the contaminated gravel was placed into an appropriate container for disposal at fully licensed hazardous waste management facility.",Our investigation determined that the cause of the incident was a suspected chemical reaction within the drum that caused it to pressurize and tear at the seam.

While unloading, one leaking 55-gallon drum was discovered inside of the trailer.  Approximately 40 gallons of free product were released and impacted some asphalt.  Apparently, the damage to the drum was due to being crushed by other freight during transit.  Lincoln Environmental of Ogden, Utah was dispatched to perform the cleanup.      Lincoln Environmental applied absorbent material to contain the free liquid inside and outside of the trailer.  The leaking 55-gallon drum was placed into a 95-gallon over-pack drum.  The contaminated absorbent materials were placed into twelve (12) heavy duty plastic bags for disposal.  Lincoln Environmental transported one (1) 95-gallon over-pack drum containing the leaking 55-gallon drum and twelve (12) heavy duty plastic bags of contaminated absorbent material to their facility in Ogden, Utah pending disposal coordination.      No injuries or exposures were reported.  The Material Safety Data Sheet was requested and received.","Since the release was accidental, no actions have been taken to prevent recurrence.

IMTT-Bayonne determined that human error was the root cause because the system was not designed with a check valve. A check valve was installed after the incident.  Additionally IMTT-Bayonne believes that the order of operations was a significant contributing factor on behalf of the operator since this operation has been conducted many times without incident.  The operator did not allow sufficient pressure to build within the IBC before openning the product valve.

While traveling on Interstate 80, approximately 10 miles west of Wamsutter, Wyoming, the RRDF driver lost control of the vehicle, as a result of snowy weather conditions, which caused the truck to veer off the road into the median of the Interstate.  The Wyoming Highway Department responded to assess the site.  D&L Excavation was dispatched to assist in containment and cleanup efforts.  Upon arrival on site, D&L Excavation inspected the trailer, and assessed the damage.  D&L Excavation proceeded to commence in offloading the trailer.  Due to poor visibility and hazardous conditions, site was secured, until further cleanup/assessment the following day.  D&L Excavation returned to the site on October 22, and offloaded the damaged freight.  Four (4) 55-gallon drums of sodium hydroxide, solid, and one (1) 5-gallon pail of Ardrox Base Oil were discovered leaking.  Approximately 10 gallons of sodium hydroxide, solid, and 5 gallons of Ardrox Base Oil had released inside the trailer.  D&L Excavation also detected a minimal amount of diesel fuel, approximately 20 gallons, had released from the vehicle's tractor.  D&L Excavation overpacked the leaking containers and swept up the released product, which was containerized into recovery drums, pending disposition from the shipper.  D&L Excavation also excavated the impacted soil from within the median, which was transported for disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  Remaining freight was repalletized and shrinkwrapped, pending disposition.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since the release occurred as a result of a vehicle accident, caused by inclement weather, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

The liquid commodity was leaking from the tank container's bottom. Contract responders constructed containment dams on both sides of the main tracks to contain spillage from IHAU 870701. BNSF and contract responders removed IHAU 870701 from the flatcar and placed it in a bermed containment area atop plastic sheeting. A vacuum truck was used to remove all remaining product from within IHAU 870701. The intermodal flatcar and IHAU 870701 were cleaned. Air monitoring and soil sampling were conducted. Traces of the product spill were reported along the track westward approximately 25 miles. Concentrated product spillage was absorbed with soda ash and Portland cement which included larger spill areas that were earmarked for soil excavation and disposal. All remediated impacted ballast and soil were staged for appropriate disposal. Some remediation activities continue as of this time. A BNSF inspection of the interior of IHAU 870701 revealed the breach as a crack in the tank. The crack was approximately 30 inches long and located about 30 inches from the tank's bottom, originating or terminating about five inches from the tank's head weld. The cause of the crack is under investigation. The decontaminated and cleaned IHAU 870701 container was trucked to the consignee's facility for further investigation into the tank's compromising crack.  Local authorities initiated an evacuation of 25-30 residences (approximately 40 people) within 1/2 mile on either side of the tracks at Pomona. The evacuation ended for most of those affected by 1630 hrs. CDT, 10/09/07; the exception being those people whom resided close to the site location.    The 16 member BNSF employee work gang working near the track that observed and reported IHAU 870701 leaking product were all taken to local hospitals for decontamination and examination.",No additional comments.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,16,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,560000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The Chemresearch employee took the tote from the back of the Univar flat rack trailer, lowered the tote, backed up and turned then drove forward towards their building.  The forklift's front tires started to go across a water culvert in the road which made the tote fall forward off of the forks. The 2"" vent bung popped out of the tote and five gallons of product then came out of the 2"" opening until the tote was uprighted.  The Univar driver immediately placed four absorbent pillows taken from his truck Emergency kit, on the spill to assist in containing the leaking product.  At the same time the Chemresearch employee uprighted the tote with his forklift.  Chemresearch employees then proceeded to clean up the spill. No product went into any storm drains.","1.

Driver of combination units was travelling at 20mph and was too fast for conditions as the unsettled liquidsurge cause the cargo tank to slowly roll over onto its right side and pulled the power unit with it. They both ended upresting against the guardrail of the the on ramp. The cargo tank sustained damaged to the shell at the 13:00 o'clockposition and began leaking product Sodium Chlorite Class 8, UN1908, PG II until the level of product in the tank fellbelow the cracked shell. Approximately 9000lbs of product flowed out of the tank in the first 3 hours. The emergencyresponse company Hulcher Services arrived on the scene and began to dyke the area of the runoff and contain anyadditional spillage to the immediate area of the intersection. Soil was excavated containing the spilled liquid anddeposited into two roll off boxes that were sampled and sent off site for disposal at a secured landfill facility. A smallquantity of oil from the engine and fuel from the tractor tanks was also spilled onto the highway and recovered into 3recovery drums. They were also sent for disposal to a secured TSD facility.","This accident has its root cause in driving too fast for conditions. Instead of coming to a full stop at the highwayentrance and proceeding to turn left, the driver slowed down and attempted to manoeuvre the turn at too great a rateof speed and could not keep the cargo tank unit on its wheels. Once the unit began to lift off the highway the drivercould not recover and he lost control of the combination unit and ended up on its side. Fluid dynamics in cargo tanktraining as it relates to driving around sharp curves would certainly have provided additional awareness and mayhave prevented this unfortunate incident all together.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,ZZ,ZZ,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,166000,TRIMAC TRANSPORATION SERVICES,XX,QC

The tank cars did not rupture Due to the cars twisting as they rolled on their side this caused the man way hatch to break the seal on cars GATX 66350 andGATX 44586 . The other cars were in tact but leaking minimally at the tank train interconnection hose shut off valve.The release began at 1355, all leaks were under control, either stopped or contained in 12 hours.Cars # GATX 66350 and GATX 44586 were immediately pumped off into tank trucks, and the other cars were completed pumped off in by 1000 on 10/23/07Immediate response had containment booms and dikes along the river bank to catch spill. Agreed for safety purposes by the Haz Mat Team not to contain gasoline on site, but allow to enter river Once leaks were contained or stopped the protective booms were maintained along the river to absorb any seepagefrom the rain Absorbant material was used to clean up any residue on the ground at spill area.VTR hired a local environmental firm to work with the State and EPA for final cleanup and mitigation of spill area, including soil removal if necessary.","The VTR has been operating the tank train since the mid 70's with out incident, however, it is evident that the tank train concept works Both the locking couplers and the interconnected hoses between cars in conjunction with valves at the end of each car, when shut acts as a single car. In this circumstance they worked perfectly, keeping the product in the cars even though some of the interconnect hoses had been damaged.VTR is taking additional measures to have an electronic consist of each train containing hazardous materials that leaves the yard, in the hands of the dispatcher. Hence, allowing the dispatcher to fax or email the Fire Department if necessary.From this experience , we need to prequalify environmental haz mat response company.

Shortly afterwards, a BNSF northbound train on the main track struck the rail equipment fouling the single main track which resulted in the derailment of the northbound train's two locomotive units and its head 22 railcars. Included in this derailment of the northbound train was UCLX 30002 (DOT 111A100W5 tank car) that came to rest in a slanted upright position atop other derailed rail equipment and sustained several breaches to its tank car shell. The B-end head sustained a large dent in the upper left head quadrant with a large peel tear in the head metal which allowed a large volume of product to escape. Also in the B-end head were two one inch puncture holes within the lower right head quadrant. The A-end side shell sustained a 3 inch by 3 inch puncture hole as well. It was estimated that the majority of the commodity within UCLX 30002 was lost. UCLX 30002 was cleaned and purged on site. BNSF contract responders applied lime to the ground spillage to neutralize the acid spill. Neutralized impacted soil was later excavated and staged for appropriate disposal.  Approximately 350 to 400 residents in the southwest portion of Clara City were evacuated. The evacuation ended at 1600 hrs. CDT, 10/29/07.

NATX 38195 was cordoned off in the railyard awaiting inspection. A BNSF contract responder inspected NATX 38195 and reported finding the leak origin from under the sealed protective housing cover. The liquid valve was approximately 1/2 turn open which was caused by the valve's handle movement after contacting the inside of the protective housing cover when the cover was closed. The responder closed the valve, removed the valve handle and secured the handle to the closure plug chain. The tool tight closure plug on this valve was the leak source and the product seepage at the plug connection stopped when the valve was closed. The responder tried to remove the plug for inspection but couldn't without damaging the stainless steel plug. The plug threads may have been cross threaded or galled. All spillage evaporated. This response was concluded by 1945 hrs. MDT, 10/29/07. NATX 38195 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard to await further repairs. The shipper arranged for a new replacement liquid valve assembly to be sent to Denver and installed. Valve replacement was accomplished on 11/13/07 prior to 1650 hrs. MST without further incident.

After stopping for traffic, the driver accelerated causing the tractor to shake. This shaking caused 3 - 275 gallon IBCs of Autoacid A-80-N to shift in the truck breaking the load lock andsliding out of the truck onto the road. Driver immediately circled back around and contacted 911. 2 of the 3 IBCs were leaking from the top closure and significant damage was noted on all IBCs from fall.

Approximately 200 gallons of Autoacid A-80-N leaked. The spill was neutralized and cleaned up by Marion Environmental Services.","Peach State Labs, Inc. has purchased additional higher capacity load locking devices and has revised box truck loading procedures to ensure against future load shifts.

They removed seal # SPICT 732226, but noted that seal# MATU 123577, which was the seal of record wason the floor inside the container. BNSF rejected the load because of the seal discrepancy and because theydiscovered 2 boxes of fireworks had been ripped open in what we think was an attempt to pilfer. The SPICT seal isconsistent with Shanghai Pudong International Container Terminals, the terminal it came from in China, therefore weassume the alleged attempt to pilfer took place before it left China. Matson sent the container to us to for evaluationand correction. We opened the container and discovered a large inspection hole in the center of the plywood andblocking & bracing. Two of the cartons had been ripped open, but the weight of the cartons above preventedremoval of the roman candles. Matson contacted the consignee and they Fedexed 2 new cartons to us. Weremoved the blocking & bracing and the 2 cartons, transferred the roman candles to the new cartons and replacedthe blocking & bracing. Matson paid the trucker $285.00 to round trip the container between BNSF and our yard andwe charged $285.00 to rework, block & brace the load.",We suggested to Matson that they advise the shipper to cut smaller inspection holes in the plywood which are onlyslightly larger than the hazmat stickers. This would make it very difficult for anyone to rip open a carton in an attemptto pilfer and is all that the BNSF requires for inspection purposes.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,XX,,,1483,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,570,GSL TRANS,US,

Mgr. Lerch responded and requested the RMCC make shipper notification via Chem-Trec. On arrival, Mgr. Lerch noted product leaking from the bottom of the car around the sump due to car liner failure. Car was leaking at a rate of approximately 1/2 gallon per minute. Upon determining source and cause of the release, Mgr. Lerch placed a containment pool below the car to contain the release. Mgr. Lerch then contacted consignee representative Tim Lancelin, Hazmat Manager for Oxy Vinyl, advised him of the release, and requested he dispatch response personnel to the area for further handling of the car and remediation of the site. Additionally, Mgr. Larch dispatched personnel from Center of Toxicology & Environmental Health to conduct air monitoring. At 07:30 AM, Mgr. Lerch spoke to shipper representative Bart Lambert, day shift shipping supervisor for Occidental Chemical. Mgr. Lerch advised Mr. Lambart of the release, that the spill had been contained, the consignee had been contacted and arrangements were being made to off load the car into tank trucks, and remediate the area. At 09:57 AM, tank car HOKX 8286 was moved from Bowl 63 to Track 112 so that full yard operations could resume. CTEH personnel were on site providing air monitoring. Matt Allen, Texas Commission Environmental Quality and Tim 0 Brien Regional Manger of Hazardous Materials were on site as well. Approximately ten gallons of product had been released from the tank car, and was neutralized under the supervision of the TCEQ, with no drains, waterways affected, and no reported injuries. At 04:43 PM, off loading operations began. Due to complications, off loading activities were delayed, and would continue throughout the evening, and into the following day. At 09:00 AM on 10-13-07, United States Environmental Services Contractor arrived to assist in the transloading operation. At 12:30 PM on 10-13-07, transloading operations were complete, Oxy Vinyl and United States Environmental personnel were in the process of repairing the car, and remediating the surrounding area. Denise Seals, Manager of Environmental Held Operations, was on site, and was provided a turnover of the incident to oversee further site activities, and to relieve Mgr. s Lerch and O Brien. At 04:50 a patch was applied to the tank car, but would require further work prior to moving the car to home shop. Personnel cleared the area and the car was left on site for further handling. On 10115/2007 at 03:56 PM additional patching of the car was completed. The car was then moved to a spotting track within the yard awaiting billing to move the car to home shop for repair.

Mr. Santos advised no injuries, no illnesses, no exposures, and no waterways were involved with this incident. Mr. Santos stated the tankcar was still releasing product at approximately two gallons per minute. Paul Person, Manager Environmental Field Operations, was notified and responded.  At 08:02 AM, Darin Musick, Mechanical Manager, reported he placed  absorbent pads and blankets around the track to help contain the release until stopped. At 08:30 AM, Mgr. Person reported the release was slowed down to a trickle from the bottom valve plate and the surrounding area was contained. Mr. Person requested shipper contact for remediation purposes. State and Federal regulatory agency notifications were made. At 09:28 AM, Mr. Person reported the release was stopped with no damage reported to the tankcar. Mr. Person advised he made contact with the shipper who would be responsible for remediation and further shipment maintenance due to the tankcar not meeting federal shipping requirements. At 12:48 PM, Mgr. Person reported the railcar was a three compartment railcar with the release contained to the B end compartment from the flange plate on the bottom outlet valve. Mr. Person advised the bolts had been tightened and there was a slight drip still from one of the stripped bolts. Mr. Person stated a contractor was en route to pump out the rest of the product in the B end compartment so the container could be released to its final destination before being decommissioned. Mr. Person advised no digging would be required for remediation.

DEHAC has since arrested the suspected individual on 4 counts. Immediate cleanup of the site was done and test show that clean up was completed.     Contact was made with Art Ramsey of the Fed DOT, and a letter was faxed to him on 11/09/207 by me stating that this was called a ""pre transpotation function"" and that this property is not an authorized transfer station.
