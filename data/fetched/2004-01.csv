THE LOAD WAS BEING TRANSPORTED BY SYSTEM TRANSPORT, AND WAS THE FIRST DILUTION WE WERE DOING ON BEHALF OF JONES-HAMILTON.  PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF THE TRUCK, ONE OF TITAN'S TRANSLOADERS SECURED OUR UNLOADING ASSEMBLY AND AIR VALVE TO THE RAIL CAR.  WHEN THE TRUCK ARRIVED, WE FIRST TRANSFERRED THE WATER TO THE TRAILER.  NEXT, WE HOOKED THE ACID HOSES TO THE TRAILER AND BEGAN TO TRANSLOAD THE HCI.  AT THE END OF THE TRANSFER PROCESS, OUR TRANSLOADER DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD FAILED TO ATTACH THE PORTION OF THE UNLOADING ASSEMBLY THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO SEAL OFF THE RAIL CAR WHILE CLEARING THE TRANSFER HOSES.  HE THEN MADE THE DECISION TO DEPRESSURIZE THE RAIL CAR AND BLOW AIR FROM THE TRAILER TO THE CAR TO RID THE HOSES OF THE REMAINING ACID.  UNFORTUNATELY WHILE DOING THIS, WE EXPERIENCED AN EXCESSIVE BUILD UP OF AIR PRESSURE IN OUR TRANSFER PUMP WHICH CRACKED ITS HOUSING.  AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 12 TO 15 GALLONS OF ACID SPILLED ONTO THE PAVEMENT.  THE SPILL WAS IMMEDIATELY CONTAINED, AND OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM WAS NOTIFIED.  THE SPILL WAS NEUTRALIZED AND CLEANED, AND THE WASTE GENERATED IN THE PROCESS WAS DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.  TO PREVENT THIS MISTAKE FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE, WE HAD A TRAINING SESSION WITH THE TRANSLOADERS THAT ADDRESSED THE FOLLOWING POINTS: 1. THE PUMP USED IN THE TRANSFER OF THE HCI IS DESIGNED TO PERMIT THE PASSAGE OF PRODUCT AND AIR IN ONLY ONE DIRECTION.  THIS DIRECTION IS FROM THE RAIL CAR TO THE TRUCK, NOT THE TRUCK TO THE CAR.  THE PROPER FITTINGS MUST BE ATTACHED TO THE RAIL CAR IN ORDER FOR US TO SAFELY AND COMPLETELY CLEAR THE TRANSFER HOSES ONCE THE TRANSLOAD IS DONE.  3. WHENEVER FACED WITH AN UNUSUAL SITUATION, CALL A SUPERVISOR FOR HIS INPUT.  IT IS LIKELY THAT A MORE EXPERIENCED TRANSLOADER WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS ACCIDENT FROM HAPPENING.",,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,SYSTEM TRANSPORT A CORP,US,

HE PARKED THE VEHICLE AT THE CURB, SET THE EMERGENCY FLASHERS AND PROCEEDED TO THE SIDE DOOR OF THE BOX.  UPON OPENING THE DOOR HE DISCOVERED THAT AN H-TANK, CONTAINING OXYGEN, COMPRESSED HAD FALLEN INTO THE NON-SPECIFICATION CRYOGENIC CARGO TANK, CONTAINING OXYGEN, REFRIGERATED LIQUID, MOUNTED IN THE VEHICLE. IN FALLING ON THE CARGO TANK THE H-TANK HAD BROKEN THE PRESSURE GAUGES AND OXYGEN WAS VENTING INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE BOX.

WHEN THE COVER ON THE PROTECTIVE HOUSING WAS OPENED, IT WAS VERY APPARENT THAT THE CAR WAS LEAKING FROM THAT AREA BUT IT WAS UNKNOWN WHICH FITTING WAS LEAKING.  ME. SEKAVEC UTILIZED A SULFUR STICK TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHICH FITTING WAS DEFECTIVE BUT THE CONCENTRATION OF THE AMMONIA WAS HIGH ENOUGH THAT THE INDICATION WAS GIVEN THROUGHOUT THE PROTECTIVE HOUSING.

WE HAD BEEN UNLOADING A TDI RAILCAR FOR APPROXIMATELY 1.5 HOURS WHEN A PIGTAIL PRESSURE GAUGE SIPHON CONNECTION ON THE DISCHARGE SIDE OF THE UNLOADING PUMP BROKE.  THE CHEMICAL UNLOADING OPERATOR WAS OUTSIDE ON THE TANK TRUCK UNLOADING PAD PUMPING OUT COLLECTED RAINWATER FROM THE SUMP.  OUR LOCAL PIPING CONTRACTOR WAS ALSO IN THE AREA.  AFTER HITTING THE EMERGENCY STOP FOR THE TDI UNLOADING SYSTEM, THE CHEMICAL UNLOADING OPERATOR IMMEDIATELY CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE PRESSURIZED RAIL CAR AND SHUT OFF THE SUPPLY VALVE TO THE PUMP, THE PIPING CONTRACTOR SHUT OFF THE SUCTION VALVE ON THE PUMP AND THE TDI HAD BEEN SPILLED ON THE ADJACENT PLATFORM AND IN THE RAIL DOCK PIT OVER THE COURSE OF 1 TO 2 MINUTES.  WE EVACUATED PERSONNEL FROM THE AREA AND THE PLANT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER BEGAN TDI MONITORING IN THE SURROUNDING AREAS.  THE CHEMICAL SPILL TEAM THEN POURED TDI AND NEUTRALIZER ON THE PLATFORM, PUMP, PIPES AND IN THE PIT.  THE AREA WAS MARKED WITH CORDON CAUTION TAPE AND PORTABLE FLOOR FANS WERE BROUGHT TO THE DOCK TO DIRECT THE TDI AND NEUTRALIZER VAPORS AWAY FROM THE SURROUNDING WORK AREAS.  WE GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 2 DRUMS OF CLEAN UP WASTE (ABSORBENT MATERIALS, GLOVES, ETC.) THAT HAVE BEEN LABELED AS HAZARDOUS WASTE AND PLACED IN THE CENTRAL ACCUMULATION AREA.  I PLACED SPILL NOTIFICATION CALLS TO THE FOLLOW AGENCIES: NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AT 7:43 AM (REPORT NO. 709677), STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMMISSION (SERC) AT 7:54 AM, AND ENVIRONMENTAL COORDINATOR FOR THE CITY OF RUSSELLVILLE AT 7:58 AM.  SINCE THE SPILLED TDI DID NOT ULTIMATELY LEAVE THE FACILITY AND ENTER ANY WATERWAYS, OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE FROM THESE AGENCIES WAS NOT NECESSARY OR REQUESTED.  ALTHOUGH THE RELEASE WAS IN EXCESS OF THE REPORTABLE QUANTITY (RQ) OF 100 POUNDS, THE MATERIAL REMAINED WITHIN THE BUILDING DURING THE SPILL AND CLEANUP AND DID NOT ENTER THE ENVIRONMENT.  UNDER CERCLA (COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980) AND EPCRA (EMERGENCY PLANNING AND COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT OF 1986), THE SPILL WAS EXCLUDED FROM REPORTING AS DESCRIBED IN 40 CFR 302.3 AND 40 CFR 355.40 (A)(2)(I).  AT THE TIME OF THE SPILL, I COULD NOT ABSOLUTELY MAKE THE DETERMINATION THAT NO TDI HAD LEFT THE BUILDING, SO I DECIDED THE PRUDENT COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO IMMEDIATELY REPORT THE INCIDENT TO THE APPROPRIATE AGENCIES.  IT APPEARED THAT THE FAILURE OF THE SIPHON CONNECTION WHICH HAD BROKEN IN THE PIPE THREADS WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO FATIGUE FROM PUMP VIBRATION.  IT WAS REPLACED WITH A SECTION OF FLEXIBLE STAINLESS STEEL BRAIDED TEFLON LINED HIGH PRESSURE HOSE TO ISOLATE THE GAUGE AND DAMPEN THIS VIBRATION.  THE PUMPING SYSTEM WILL BE MONITORED TO DETERMINE IF OTHER MODIFICATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF OTHER VIBRATION RELATED PROBLEMS.
