Steel Spec Universal Primer UN1263 originated from (10) 5-gallon metal pail that were stacked 3 high. Contractor noticed a grey primer and that was due to a leak of product Protective Marine Coatings (General polymers GP-3569A56 Part A Silver Grey) originating from inside a (1) 5-gallon pail due to the corner of a broken pallet puncturing the pail.

Once it was determined the RQ had been exceeded, NRC was called.  The clean-up operations were already initiated.  Spill was contained and did not impact nearby waterway.    At spill site, Environmental Restoration met with state and local regulators as well as the fire department to determine the scope of work.  It started to rain about 4 pm so the team begins neutralizing spill area with citric acid.  The roadway was rinsed with water and collected in vac truck.  Soil and gravel in impacted area was collected for disposal.  Random samples were tested with strips to confirm pH of 7.    Collected material will be disposed of by Badger Daylighting.

Portland Rigby railyard. The responding emergency crews located the leak by sense of smell, audible hiss of releasing product, and visual indicators of a liquid propane leak. Terminal operator Jordan Ellsworth was contacted and reported to the terminal. After a discussion with the emergency responders, the terminal operator and two members of the fire department were allowed to access the rail car. Upon ascending to the top of the tank car and opening the protective housing cover, a liquid valve was viewed leaking on railcar UTLX956600. The valve type was a Midland 720 or 721 series valve. The secondary closure (threaded steel plug) was in place and tool tight. A review of the plug identified multiple layers of Teflon tape on a portion of the plug threads. During mitigation of the event, Operator Jordan Ellsworth confirmed securement of the plug by placing a physical exertion on the plug. It was confirmed that the plug was tool tight in accordance with the regulations and this action was witnessed by two members of the emergency response team. It is suspected that the valve may have an internal failure and the product was leaking past the closed valve and the taped portion of the plug.","After a review of the release, it was determined that a consideration that may prevent future leaks on the threaded portion on the steel plug is to ensure that the threads of the plug valve are clear of any potential obstructions such as multiple tape layers. This action can be performed by removing old tape, brushing the threads as appropriate if necessary and the application of new tape OR appropriate thread dope which is product compatible for propane. Furthermore, it would suggested that employees who are trained and qualified to perform product transfer on rail cars review appropriate policies, procedures, or training materials that will demonstrate the appropriate actions.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Amerigas Propane,US,

They called the carrier, who contacted the CMTV driver, who stopped the CTMV.  The driver climbed the CTMV's ladder, found a remote-actuated vapor vent valve was not fully closed, despite the actuator indicator showing it closed.  The vapor vent valve is a 3"" ball valve, which, upon very close inspection, he noticed was just slightly open.  He manually closed the valve.  We estimate the HazMat only released briefly due to movement related surging, however, about one hour elapsed from when the driver first moved the CTMV and when he closed the valve.  Our Reference No. 69111","This CTMV is equipped with a safety system that allows the top-mounted vent valve to be remotely operated using a ground level control.  In this incident, the remote-actuator was loose and became mis-aligned with the ball valve that it actuates.

This cause the ramp to be blocked for around 10 hours. The incident was reported immediately to Chemtrec. There were no other participants in the incident such as other vehicles or pedestrians. The shipper was immediately informed as well, and Irving, TX Fire Department was at the scene in 2 minutes. There were no injuries on the scene. After the opening of the trailer it was discovered, that a very small amount of the cargo (cleaning compound) was released in the trailer due to the liquid tote been on its side and about 20 gallons leaked through the cab. The liquid totes were slightly deformed but were not licking at all, except for 1 that was lifted up and stopped the leakage. Later on the cargo was taken out of the trailer by the Irving Fire Department crew and reloaded to a different trailer and safely transported back to the shipper.","Partially the cause of the tilt was that some of the liquid totes were half full and created strong search causing the liquid to splash into the tote making the transportation unstable. The load was secured and after the opening of the trailer was discovered that cargo was at same positions as it was loaded and that points to the extra liquid search being the main cause of the incident.  Also it was mentioned by the Fire Department that this particular ramp does not have the right amount of tilt in turn to help vehicles enter, proceed and exit through the ramp, as needed. And did not have posted safe speed limit on the ramp. Also Irving Fire Department officials mentioned that similar incidents had happened before at those ramp.",Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,1731,"DS Express, Inc.",US,

Quick Response, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the car was leaking from the pressure release vent (PRV) due to multiple broken/missing components of the PRV: broken threads on the frangible disc retaining ring, frangible disc not installed, frangible disc retaining ring not install, broken threads on frangible disc base assembly, surge protection insert gasket not installed.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative – Garrick Ramage.  Contractor personnel made emergency repairs to the PRV to secure the release.

Sodium Hypochlorite was pumped from rail stand #1 to rail stand #3 and exited transfer hose at rail stand #3. Sodium Hypochlorite discharged to ground at/around rail stand #3. Note: railcar did not fail, release caused by failure to properly close Sodium Hypochlorite plant transfer valve.   Description of the Accident (from first notification to termination of event)    8:15 AM - Plant worker Jeffrey Luckey, was unloading Sodium Hypochlorite 10.5 % by weight from rail car TILX 110424 from rail car stand #1 into storage tank #2. Approximately 30 minutes into the unloading process, Jeffrey Luckey noticed liquid beginning to pool under rail car stand #1.  Jeff immediately stopped unloading process by closing product discharge valve located atop rail car TILX 110424.   8:20 AM - Plant worker Jeff Luckey then called Jacksonville Plant Mgr David Schultz and informed him of the event.  David Shultz and Jeffrey Luckey walked to rail car stand # 3 and determined that the transfer valve at rail car stand #3 had been left open from the previous shift. Due to this open valve at rail car stand #3, product being off loaded from TILX 110424 at rail car stand #1, was inadvertently pumped through open valve at rail car stand #3 and exited rail car transfer hose found to have loosely fitted blind flange attached to hose end.  Product was pooled on the ground in the areas of rail cars stands #3, #2, #1.   8:25 AM - Plant Manager David Schultz then contacted Branch Manager Ky Nicholson and provided details of the event. Ky Nicholson then contacted by phone, Regional Manager Ron Zeigler and VP of Operations Todd Tucker and informed them of the event.

Big Spring St., Ste 600",Midland,TX,79701,Carrier,"Loving County- The driver of a semitrailer truck escaped critical injury early this Mother's Day (13-MAY-2018) morning after his truck spun out of control on County Road 300, about 6 miles north of Mentone, Texas..  Gregory R. Hines was traveling north on County Road 300 early Sunday, 13-MAY-2018, when his truck veered into the east shoulder and flipped over, said the Loving County Sheriff's Department officers that investigated the crash.  Hines is an employee of Plains Marketing, L. P. working out of the Pecos TX Truck District.  Hines was taken to the Winkler County Hospital by Winkler County EMS.  He was examined and evaluated there and subsequently released later that day. The cargo tank rupture allowed crude oil to leak onto an area of pasture east of the CR300 Right-of-Way where the semitrailer came to rest. Plains' Pecos Emergency Response Team contained the spill using containment booms, absorbents, and soil. Duration of the spill was approximately one hour. The cargo tank ruptures were circular breaches in the lower driver side quadrant of the tank shell, and tears rearward of the front bulkhead","Immediately after receiving notification of the crash, at 1300 on 13-May-2018, Pecos Truck District management convened a safety stand down meeting for all drivers and reiterated Plains policies and guidance on distracted driving and overall safe driving practices.  Highlights of the directions are listed below. 1. Use your cell phone for emergency situations only. While you're driving, a cell phone should only be used for    emergency purposes. Even then, it's best to pull over safely to the right shoulder to make a call.  2. If you are drowsy, pull off the road. If you feel tired, get off the road; don't try to get home faster.  3. Limit the level of activity inside the vehicle.  Stay focused on the road rather than in-cab activities.  4. Avoid eating while driving.  Food spills are a major cause of distraction. 5. Do your multi-tasking outside the truck. Everyone spends a lot of time in their vehicles, and it may seem like the perfect time to get little things done: calling friends, searching for good music, maybe even text messaging. Don't do it. Focus on the road and the drivers around you. Get everything settled before you start driving. Take your time driving. The entire object is to keep yourself and your load safe on the road.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,153000,Plains All American,US,

At least one (1) piece for each island contained Dry Ice/UN1845.   HA Cargo Agent stated in her report she was unfamiliar with the process of accepting DG shipments,  so she asked her co-worker for assistance.  She asked her co-worker a few questions on what  needed to be done, so her co-worker advised her she needed to complete a Dry Ice Checklist for  each shipment, since all 4 shipments contained Dry Ice.  This is where the communication ended  between the two Agents.  Cargo Agent completing the checklist was unaware and did not know a NOPIC was needed for these  shipments containing Dry Ice.     The shipments for Kona and Maui went out to the flight line for departure.  The Kona shipment flew on HA398/23MAY18 with no NOPIC (AWB 04765331) .   As the Maui shipment was being uploaded to a flight, the Loading Ramp Agent noticed the DG stickers on the shipment and realized the article did not have a NOPIC.  The agent rejected the shipment and advised  the Cargo Runner of the reason why.  The Cargo Runner returned to the Cargo facility and notified  the office of the situation.  Cargo Agent that prepared the documents for the shipments was informed a NOPIC was needed for all Dry Ice shipments  and at that point she realized all the shipments she just processed did not have the required NOPIC.   The Cargo Agent confirmed with the Cargo Runner the shipments for Maui, Hilo and Lihue were still at the  Cargo facility, however the shipment for Kona (AWB 04765331) had already departed.    Cargo Agent immediately checked to ensure there were no AVIH on the same flight with the Kona  shipment and confirmed there was none.  One of the Office Agents assisted the Cargo Agent in completing a  NOPIC for each of the remaining shipments for Maui, Hilo and Lihue.",Root causes of the incident are insufficient awareness of DG .     Awareness:  Cargo agent will need to be re-trained at the front counter and require proper guidance on the  correct procedure of identifying and accepting DG and  having an overall awareness.    Cargo Agent has been counseled on the correct steps/actions to follow when accepting DG.

Illinois St, Indianapolis, IN 46285).    The Post Office employee mentioned the box had an odor.  A Lilly Contractor moved the box to  the Lilly X-Ray machine where the box was determined to contain 5 bottles.  The bottles were  not broken.  Based on the concerns of a potential chemical release, the Lilly Mail Hub contacted  the Lilly Fire/Rescue (LFR) for response.  LFR determined the package was labeled as containing  “tert-Butyl Isocyanide”.  In full respiratory protection, LFR opened the package, removed the  5 bottles, double wrapped the bottles in plastic, placed in plastic buckets, and surrounded the  items with absorbent.    Eli Lilly contacted the Post Office Inspector for Indianapolis, Ken Miller (317-945-7492), to  inform Post Office employees of potential exposure.    The package was sent via EMS SpeedPost from Conier Chem&Pharma Limited,  No 122 Honkong Street Kowloon,  Bay Lowloon Bay Horngjean HK, Hong Kong.    The chemical was identified on the shipping label.  The package contained 5 glass bottles  estimated at 0.5 L  in size.  The bottles were individually tapped shut at the cap and packaged in  bubble wrap.  The bubble wrapped bottles were placed in the box and surrounded with  Styrofoam peanuts.  Each bottle was approximately half full at time of repackaging.  The box  did not have any Hazardous Material Labels.  (See pictures in attached pdf)  The SDS identifies this chemical as a Hazardous Material with the transport information as  UN1992, Flammable Liquid, Toxic, N.O.S (2-Methylpropyl isocyanide), 3 (6.1), PG II.",Eli Lilly notified Fisher Scientific (importer of record) of the incident.

LEGACY CENTER WAY,Midvale,LA,84047,Facility,"On Thurs 5/24@ 13:15 Hrs., the Savage Elko, NV Transload terminal incurred a 400 gal release of Ammonium nitrate, liquid(UN2426) from a Southwest Energy LLC tank car GATX 222232 that previously contained 18,332 gals, due to personnel not properly setting up said car to be sparged/bubbled. AN liquid tank cars need to be sparged/bubbled for effective even heating and to churn the product when changing it's stated from a solid to a liquid solution mixture to prevent salting and settled solids from accumulating. When setting up GATX 222232 for sparging from the car's Bottom Outlet Valve(BOV), the operator opened up the wrong tank car valve(e.g., liquid education line valve, rather than the air/vapor valve) in order to vent the car. Once pressure began to slowly build in the tank car, product began to discharge from the tank car's liquid education line valve, and cascaded down the sides of the car and accumulated in the track ballast and adjacent asphalt dive way. Once compressed air pressure was shutoff to the car, and the flow of product began to dissipate; terminal personnel then began emergency response initiatives, and notifications. Enviro Care(ER/Environmental Contractor) personnel responded to the scene, to clean-up the spill, remediate the affected area, clean GATX 222232 and estivate ballast and soil. No storm water and/or ground water was affected.","The following corrective actions were implemented stemming from this incident: 1) A safety stand down was held with the entire Elko team to review this incident, along with the key leanings(e.g., cease rushing; how to properly identify vapor and liquid tank car valves, if in doubt exercise your stop work authority and immediately contact Mgmt., don't make assumptions; how to properly and safely sparge/bubble Ammonium nitrate, liquid tank cars)- Completed 5/25 2) The involved operator was provided coaching/counseling and issued performance improvement, with the emphasis of learning from this incident(e.g., cease rushing; how to properly identify vapor and liquid tank car valves, if in doubt exercise your stop work authority and immediately contact Mgmt., don't make assumptions; how to properly and safely sparge/bubble Ammonium nitrate, liquid tank cars)- Completed 6/5 I 3) Composed a pictorial procedure for safely sparging/bubbling tank cars which contain Ammonium nitrate, liquid; conduct corresponding training with the Elko team members on this procedure.- Completed 6/1",Yes,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,8000,SAVAGE SERVICES CORP.,US,

The DOT ID number and HM Registration numbers in this report are assigned to UPS Freight, not UPS, Inc. 4 pallets containing 45 cylinders of acetylene, dissolved with a gross weight of 9315 pounds were in a UPSF trailer that moved from TN to KY. The trailer was not opened in KY as it was scheduled to move the following morning(5/30/18) towards the final destination of CT. The UPSF driver in Lexington, KY hooked up to the placarded trailer(2.1 placards) and pulled it into the trailer repair shop to replace or remove a sticker. The mechanic could not remove the sticker with a scraper so he lit a hand-held butane torch to heat up the adhesive and remove the sticker. He was three feet from the trailer when he lit the torch which created an instant flash and explosion. The entire trailer and much of the shop was destroyed. The mechanic and driver were taken to the hospital with non life-threatening injuries and kept overnight for observation.
