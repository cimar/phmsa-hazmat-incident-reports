The container was loaded with 20203 kilograms of UN3082 Tomadol 23-5 surfactant. It appeared as if the release stemmed from a faulty weld seam on the underside of the tank. The leaking tank released approximately 1 gallon of material to a compact soil and gravel parking lot. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release.  Upon discovery of the release the tank was moved to containment area by Schneider Bulk personnel in order to transfer the material to a new tank.  An environmental contractor was dispatched to respond to the release and excavate any impacted soil.  A 40' stretch of impacted gravel and soil was hand excavated and all free material recovered.

I contacted Sunpro Environmental Services to respond to the possible leak. When they arrived and investigated, they used a 5 gas meter to determine that the odors were coming from around the manway lid. They determined the vapor leak was caused by loose manway bolts. They tightened all the swing bolts, and used their 5 gas meter to determine the vapor leak had stopped.

During the offloading process a hose leading from the CTL Distribution tanker to a tank within the facility ruptured near the outlet valve of the tanker.  The ruptured hose released approximately 10 gallons of material before the tankers valve could be closed.  The release impacted the side of the building, tanker and an area of soil and gravel beneath the tanker.  No drains or waterways were impacted by the release. There were no injuries or exposures due to the release.  An environmental contractor was dispatched to clean the impacted areas.  The environmental contractor hand excavated an approximate 8'x10' area of impacted soil and containerized the impacted soil into 55 gallon steel drums.  The side of the building and tanker were cleaned off with an acetone solution and rags.  The impacted rags and debris were containerized in 55 gallon steel drums as well.  All free product was recovered and in total, 2 55 gallon steel drums of waste were generated. The waste was staged on site pending profiling and proper disposal.  The CTL Distribution tanker secured a new hose on the tanker and the transfer was completed without further incident.",,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Emergency Response and Training Solutions,US,

The damaged drum released approximately 30 gallons of material to the trailer floor and parking lot. No soils, drains or waterways were impacted by the release. An environmental contractor was dispatched to respond to the release and clean the impacted areas. The environmental contractors utilized granular absorbents and a solvent solution to clean the trailer floor and parking lot.

An operator at the 10-Day yard was in the process of transferring the drum utilizing a forklift and drum grabber attachment.  As the drum was picked up, the operator noticed the drum was leaking from the bottom.  The operator immediately notified the Veolia employee who was supervising the transfer and together they flipped the drum over to prevent further spillage.  They over-packed the drum into a 851A2 salvage drum.  The spilled material was cleaned up utilizing oil dry and packed into another drum.  Approximately 3-4 gallons of liquid was spilled from the drum.  Upon visible inspection of the bottom of the drum, there was visible rust formation and a split in the bottom seam.  There were no visible signs of rust or damage on any other part of the drum.  It is believed the failure of the drum was due to a combination of age and corrosion stress on the drum.","The Gulf Coast Branch of Veolia will institute a new policy regarding the handling of drums from Automotive type shops.

Approximately 1 cup of product has been released to the trailer floor.Contractor indicated that they were inspecting the 5 gallon poly pails and noticed that the lids do not appear to be the correct lids for these pails. Contractor indicated that they have tightened them and they still leak from the cap. Contractor has been instructed to check all of the caps in the shipment and over-pack the pails. The contractor reports that upon breaking down the second pallet they found 1-5 gallon pail that was punctured and release all contents. There were 9 pails that were not damaged, had secure lids, and did not need to be overpacked.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Emerald Performance Materials,  Ohio EPA, and the National Response Center were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2017-02-17-00161). SUNPRO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the vapor line valve open, and the vapor line valve secondary closure plug less than tool tight resulting in the release of hazardous materials. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Mr. Andy Kulacz - 330-277-2680. Contractor personnel secured the valve and tightened the secondary closure plug to compliance thus securing the release. As of this report, this subsequent inspection by the Federal Railroad Administration Hazardous Materials Inspectors have found the valve self opening, however the secondary closure plug remains secured with no further release.

Approximately an hour later, the Technical Services Manager arrived to assist the driver with spill response efforts.  Based on the site assessment, a 20 gallon container has inadvertently shifted in the trailer and leaked approximately 1 gallon of material onto the trailer floor and onto the asphalt pavement underneath.  Heritage representatives neutralized the spilled material with baking soda.  Spill clean-up materials  were placed into a 5 gallon container, labeled and transported back to Heritage Environmental Services in Kansas City, Missouri for proper disposal.     Materials Involved in Incident     The leaking container was identified to be Line 1 of manifest 000803321WAS, UN1789, Waste Hydrochloric Acid, 8, PGII, (D002), ERG#157.  Attachment A provides a copy of the Uniform Hazardous Waste manifest, Land Disposal Restriction notice and internal transportation documents used by Heritage for consignment.  Approximately, 1 gallon (10 pounds) spilled from the container.     Root Cause Analysis and Corrective Actions  The 20 gallon container that shifted in the trailer was not properly secured and the bung was not properly tightened.  Heritage is scheduled to conduct additional training on March 15, 2017 on Proper Load Securement and Proper Container Closure.","Root Cause Analysis and Corrective Actions  The 20 gallon container that shifted in the trailer was not properly secured and the bung was not properly tightened.

The driver pulled over and began to investigate.  That is when he discovered his wash out cap on the dome of the trailer had come off and was laying in the dome.  Approximately 10 gallons of Invigorate 3.0 had leaked onto the street.  IMTT's Fire Chief was notified along with City of Bayonne Police and Fire Dept.  US Ecology who is IMTT's OSRO was also contacted to initiate a cleanup operation on the roadway as well as the truck.  It was determined that the driver failed to properly secure the wash out cap.,IMTT contacted the customer of the product that was spilled.

SHAWN WAS CLIMBING AT APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH TO THE TOP OF PARLEY’S SUMMIT. AS HE PASSED EXIT 140 HE OBSERVED TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN THE RIGHT LANES OF THE ROADWAY AT THE SUMMIT, APPROXIMATELY 300 -400 FEET IN FRONT OF HIM. SHAWN MADE THE DECISION TO CHANGE LANES TO THE LEFT TO STAY CLEAR OF THE CONGESTION. HE CHECKED HIS LEFT MIRROR TO PREPARE FOR THE LANE CHANGE, LOOKED FORWARD AGAIN TO NOTICE THE LAST TRUCK STOPPED IN THE CONGESTION CLOSER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. HE PROCEEDED TO MAKE HIS LANE CHANGE INTO THE CENTER LANE, BUT NOT IN TIME TO AVOID THE OTHER TRUCK HITTING HIM. AS HE WAS PASSING THE TRUCK BEFORE THE COLLISION, SHAWN NOTICED THE TRUCK (AN OVER THE ROAD, 53 FT BOX VAN TRAILER, HAULING EMPTY BOTTLES) WAS MOVING BACKWARDS (HE SAW THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL TURNING BACKWARDS). AS IT WAS ROLLING BACKWARDS ON THE INTERSTATE, THE OTHER TRUCK’S LEFT REAR CORNER OF THE TRAILER STRUCK THE LEAD TRAILER ¾’S OF THE WAY DOWN THE RIGHT-SIDE OF THE CARGO TANK.  THIS RUPTURED THE SECOND COMPARTMENT OF THE TANK. SHAWN STOPPED HIS TRUCK, LOOKED IN THE RIGHT-SIDE MIRROR TO SEE CRUDE OIL “GUSHING” OUT OF THE CARGO TANK. HE THEN NOTICED VEHICLES PASSING ON THE LEFT DRIVING THROUGH THE SPILL OIL. HIS THOUGHTS WENT TO STOPPING OTHER VEHICLES FROM DRIVING THROUGH THE SPILL AND CONTACTING 911. AS HE WAS ON THE PHONE WITH 911 A SMALL CAR HAD DROVE THROUGH THE OIL AND IGNITED IT.    AT THIS POINT, SHAWN MOVED UPHILL AWAY FROM THE SCENE WHILE CONTINUING TO TALK WITH 911. HE LOOKED BACK AT THE SCENE AND TO SHAWN IT APPEARED THE OTHER TRUCK HAD MOVED MAYBE TRIED TO PULL AWAY FROM THE COLLISION BECAUSE THE TRACTOR HAD SLIDE OVER CLOSER TO CARGO TANK AND WAS A LITTLE FARTHER BACK, JUST FORWARD OF THE LEAKING OIL. SHAWN NOTICED A UHP OFFICER ON THE DOWNHILL SLIDE OF THE SCENE AND WALKED DOWN TO CONTACT HIM. SHAWN THEN CONTACTED D&A MCRAE MANAGEMENT. I RECEIVED A CALL AT 2220 HOURS SHAWN EXPLAINING WHAT HAD HAPPENED. CHEVRON ROOSEVELT TERMINAL MANAGER ANNA WILKINS WAS NOTIFIED DIRECTLY AT APPROXIMATELY 2245 HOURS. A RESPONSE WAS ORGANIZED AND MANAGEMENT, ROOSEVELT TERMINAL MANAGER ROD CONRAD, AND GENERAL MANAGER GABE EKKER WERE ON THE SCENE BY 0100 HOURS DUE TO DRIVE TIME AND WEATHER.    WHEN I ARRIVED ON SCENE I CONTACTED THE INCIDENT COMMANDER WHO BRIEFED ME ON THE INCIDENT, TOLD ME THEY WERE STILL SEARCHING FOR THE OTHER DRIVER AND REQUESTED I ORGANIZE THE REMOVAL AND REMEDIATION EFFORTS OF OUR VEHICLE. I DID SO, WE HAD A TRUCK TO PUMP OFF THE REMAINING LOAD, ENVIRO-CARE FOR ANY REMEDIATION EFFORTS AND BULLOCKS TOWING ON SCENE WITHIN AN HOUR AND A HALF. ONCE THE SCENE WAS CLEARED, THE REMAINING LOAD WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE AWAITING D&A TRUCK AND DELIVERED TO THE REFINERY THAT MORNING.

The container was tarped, properly loaded and secured to the roll-off trailer, and transported to Veolia Technical Solutions 10 day facility in Schenectady NY, where it was to be placed into 10 day storage.     As the driver was transferring the can from the roll-off trailer to the ground, the load shifted and slid to the back of the container. A NON-RQ amount of material was able to navigate between the roll-off can and the tarp, and onto the ground at Veolia’s facility. The EQ Northeast driver used the contents of his spill kit to quickly clean the waste up and put back into the container. Upon further inspection of the load, it was determined that excessive moisture within the material caused the load to shift.  Further, the container used for transport of this material was not designed for the consistency of the material that was placed in it.","The transporter has two recommendations to prevent future occurrences:     1. The generator needs to ensure this material is properly pressed, removing all free liquids prior to being loaded into the container.      There was a treatment system upset, that coincided with this event, that fouled the press cloths and caused the filter cake condition to contain more moisture than usual.  However, the roll-off was not shipped off site with visible free liquids.    Based on the observations, it is likely that the filter cake contained sufficient moisture that the vibrations of transport caused the liquid to separate after it left the site.    As a result of this investigation, Global Foundries will amend their procedure(s) to have a qualified person inspect the container when there is an observation that the filter cake may contain more moisture than normal and adjust their criteria for intervention to make sure it is explicit that ""wet"" filter cake is required to be addressed in the same manner as if there was visible free liquid.    2. The material needs to be loaded into de-watering boxes, which allow any free liquids to filter through the load and be pumped out prior to transport.     All roll-off cans associated with this material have already been switched to de-watering boxes as of 3/2/18.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"EQ Northeast, Inc.",US,
