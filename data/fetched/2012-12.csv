Upon opening the trailer doors, Don smelled a strong odor of paint and noticed that a drum had been punctured at the top and had spilled a very small amount of liquid (approximately 4 Ounces). Don informed me of the situation (TM-Shane Strasser). After taking pictures of the spill, we immediately pulled the punctured drum off the back of the trailer, while still in the yard, and placed it into a containment drum. The 4 ounces of liquid remaining in the trailer was wiped up with a rag. The rag was placed inside the containment drum prior to closure.

We are the Sh,"Sequence of events that led to the incident:    On 12/3/12, Tank Trailer 68901 was loaded with 50% Caustic Soda at approximately 5:00 p.m.  The Terre Haute personnel have an established practice to apply steam to the tanker when it will set overnight during cold weather to prevent the potential for freezing.  To minimize any potential problems with pressure build up, the dome lid is cracked open by resting one of the bolts between the dome lid and the opening of the dome or man way.    On 12/4/12, The Terre Haute Driver, Chuck McDowell, coupled to the tanker.  He disconnected the steam line: however, he failed to close and tighten the bolts on the dome lid.    Chuck left the Terre Haute Plant on Lockport Road at approximately 5:40 a.m.  He weighed the tanker on the scales across the street.  He then proceeded Northbound on 14th Street (Lockport Road) and turned left (West) on Voorhees Street.  When the driver stopped at the traffic light at 7th and Voorhees, the liquid apparently splashed out of the man way and onto the street; however, the driver was not aware of any problem at this time.  At approximately 5:45 a.m., the Terre Haute driver stopped again between 4th and 3rd Street in a parking lot (Show Me’s Restaurant) in order to walk to Thortons Convenient Store.  It was at this time one of our other drivers stopped at the parking lot and detected the material was dripping from the overflow in the parking lot, too.  They verified that the dome lid was cracked open, and Chuck immediately closed and tightened the dome lid.    Actions taken at the time it was discovered:    The other driver assisted with our defensive action by driving back to our plant to get some floor dry (absorbent) and report the problem to their supervisor.  The supervisor instructed several other drivers to help assist with the confinement and containment of the material and help with the traffic control.  As a result, the Brenntag personnel absorbed the material at both the 7th Street location and the material in the parking lot.  The material was properly disposed as a non-hazardous solid waste.    The Brenntag Operations Manager and Operations Supervisor was notified and arrived on the scene at approximately 6:35 a.m. to assist with the traffic control.    At approximately 6:44 a.m., Police Officer Minnick (#232) arrived on the scene.  At 6:45 a.m., the Fire Department Personnel were dispatched to assist with the clean-up activities, too.  The Hazmat Team confirmed the residue would not be harmful to the environment and a decision was made to wash down any traces of the material with their fire hoses.    The Firefighters cleared the scene by 9:00 a.m.      Package Failure:    There was no damage to the package (Tanker 68001).  The only failure related to not properly securing the dome lid.    Estimated Duration of Release:    The estimated duration of the release from 7th Street to the 4th Street Parking was approximately less than two (2) minutes.    The estimated dura","As part of our General Policy and Procedure for any Out of Service (OOS) Violations that are considered preventable, we followed our procedure GP&P 19930180 for the appropriate disciplinary action for the employee that was directly responsible for the inspection and securement.    The incident was also used as a moment of high influence in our safety meetings at the Terre Haute Facility as a refresher on the proper operating procedure for inspection of the tanker which includes securing the dome lid before coupling to the tanker if the tanker is being steam heated.    We are in-process of implementing a documented procedure to support the established practice for tanker loading and delivery so it will include a Checklist as a record to show conformance to the procedure for proper inspection and securement prior to leaving the facility.  This especially holds true for the verification that the dome lid has been secured when the tanker has been steam heated overnight.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1593,"Brenntag Mid-South, Inc.",US,

Another worker during the wash-out of the trailer also reportedly became ill.  A•C•T was requested to respond to analyze the air inside the trailer for residual ethylene oxide.     Upon arrival at the site, our response team met with the driver and was advised the current situation.  After a conducting a brief safety meeting and review of the MSDS our responder donned the proper PPE (Level C) and prepared to enter the trailer.  Utilizing an Ultra Ray PID our responder first checked a sample of the ambient air away from the suspect trailer. This sample showed a level of .75 ppm.  Upon entering the trailer, air samples were tested at sevent (7) locations throughout trailer.

The tank car was isolated. The shipper, AK Steel, was notified via Chemtrec, report # 2012-12-06-00198. A CSXT hazardous material manager, and Summit Environmental Services, a CSXT emergency response contractor, were dispatched to the scene.  Inspection of the tank car revealed that four (4) of four (4) blind flange bolts and four (4) of four (4) bolts on the lower three inch flange both on the liquid line were in a less than tool tight condition. There was a residual amount of hydrochloric acid on the liquid line assembly and beneath it on the pressure plate. The bolts were tightened appropriately and the residual acid was wiped from the tank car. The shipper representative, Larry Sutthoff, was notified of the situation found. The release was secured and PROX 14978 was released for disposition.  This incident did require a special move.

The cars were set out and isolated for response at the south end of Beaumont yard. Both cars were loads Methyl Mercaptan out of Arkema Beaumont.There are no exposures or injuries reported from this odor. Emergency notifications were made and KCS mobilized safety qualified response contractor.    Upon arrival, the response contractor verified securement of railcars and accessed to performed leak detection investigation. Upon further inspection, tank car ACFX 94870 was verified cleared of any leaks. After more leak detection was performed, it was determined that there was a very small leak originating from the Liquid Valve (B end) valve stem packing. The packing was tightened  turn to stop the release. The repair was verified by snoop-check and by air monitoring meter. Both cars were verified secure and released back into transportation.    File Note Item 19-the quantity released was A MINOR VAPOR RELEASE and therefore the amount cannot be quantified. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities,   and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence.     It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.    The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs. To improve communications the shipper can provide contact information in this web site (Contact Network) to better facilitate incident response and post incident communications as applicable.",No,TANK CAR,,105J300W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

As soon as he started product flowing, it sprayed out from the connection of our hose to the customer fill line.  Driver said he shut down the truck first because he was right there and then closed the internal and external valve.  Not sure how much spilled but 100 gallons was estimated before the flow stopped.  it is most likely not that much, though, because the containment area holds 20-25 gallons.  It did not fill it but it did spray out on to the asphalt.  Driver was exposed to some mist, on his neck, under his face shield.  He immediately went to the eye wash station and then the shower.  He was looked at by a nurse onsite but there was no indication of any exposure.  We had a spill response company come in and clean up the spill.

While enroute, just prior to the customer facility, the driver recalls driving over a bump in the road.  The driver determined that the movement of the trailer was minor and continued to the customer facility, which was approximately 5 miles away.  Once at the loading dock, the driver inspected the load and identified that a pallet had been damaged and a nail was protruding from the pallet, which appeared to have damaged a drum containing Olympia 240 (a blend of sodium hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite).  After identifying the damaged drum, the release was contained and a storm sewer located near the loading dock was blocked to avoid the release from being discharged to the storm sewer.      It was determined that 263-pounds of the product were released from the damaged drum.  Based on the composition of the product, this equates to 39.5 pounds of sodium hydroxide and 13.2 pounds of sodium hypochlorite.  This is below the reportable quantity for each of these chemicals, which is 1,000 pounds and 100 pounds respectively.    In addition to containing and collecting the release, at the request of the customer facility, the area was further cleaned by a third party hazardous response crew (North Shore Environmental).  The area was pressure washed and the rinsate was collected for disposal.","The supplier of the pallet that was damaged will be issued a “Supplier Corrective Action Request” to assist in the investigation.

At approximately 15:25, the driver turned on Route 51 south from I 74 east.  After driving approximately one mile, driver felt the trailer release from the 5th wheel traveling around 45 mph.  When the trailer legs hit the pavement they buckled, causing one leg to puncture tank, releasing Beverage Alcohol onto the pavement running into ditch.  Authorities and clean up crews were immediately notified.  Cleanup and tow crews lifted trailer to minimize/stop spill.  The duration of the spill was approximately 2 hours before crews were able to minimize.  The hole size on the trailer was approximately 5 inches long with a jagged tear.  The total amount spilled was 2159 gallons, with 413 gallons being recovered by spill crews.  Testing was conducted on remaining product leaching in soil in the nearby ditch.  We are awaiting cleanup instructions.","After performing a lengthy investigation, mechanical testing, and cause analysis, it was determined that the driver did not follow proper proceedures in making sure that the trailer was adequately locked into the 5th wheel.

Appropriate notifications were made and KCS emergency responders were activated.    Opon arrival, KCS emergency responders investigated 3 tank cars (ACF 94845, TELX 95102, TELX 95365) that were percieved to be cause of odor. After snoop solution investigation, air monitoring verification, and tank car appurtenance tightness verification, it was determined none of the original 3 tank cars were cause of source leak. KCS emergency responders were demobilized from Port Arthurt Yard.    At approximately 9:50 PM additional odor was suspected to be coming from tank car ACFX 94870 or tank car NATX 60028 (both Methyl Mercaptan cars). Appropriate notifications were made and Arkema (origin) emergency responders activated.    *Both of these cars were also involved in a Non-Accidental Release (NAR) situation for KCS on 12/21/2012. The leak was detected on tank car NATX 60028 in the B end liquid valve stem packing. Arkema responders responded to leak, tightened packing 1/2 turn, reported to KCS the leak was stopped, and car was released. A properly operating valve would not have required the second tightening process to the packing.    At approximately 11:15 PM, Arkema emergency responders arrived on-site, contacted appropriate KCS personnel and began tank car assessment. Upon closer inspection of the 2 suspected tank cars, tank car NATX 60028 was found to be leaking in the same location as the 12/21/2012 NAR, in the B end liquid valve stem packing. The tank car was switched back to origin (Arkema) for off-loading and valve replacement.     In summation, the shipper offered the tank car with a defective tank car component, the shipper's emergency responders claimed securement of the defective tank car appurtenance, and the shipper offered the tank car without proper, true securement.    *No injuries throughout the entire incident were reported.    File Note Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities,   and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence   of unsafe transportation conditions.    The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs. To improve communications the shipper can provide contact information in this web site (Contact Network) to better facilitate incident response and post incident communications as applicable.",No,TANK CAR,,105J300W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

After the liquid flow subsided, the customer hazmat team opened the rear door and discovered the valve on their tote of Sodium Hypochlorite 12.5% had broken off of the tote and the contents had all spilled out.    Immediate Corrective Action Taken: The entire spill was contained in the customer's waste treatment system.  The customer's hazmat team deconned the tote and the inside rear of the trailer.  The driver returned the tote with the broken valve and the was emptied and throughly cleaned.  The leak did not affect any of the other freight on the truck.","Based on the review by our investigation team, we estimate the nipple that joins the bottom valve to the inner tank of the tote had a stress fracture that finally released during movement of the truck.  The point of this fracture may have been in installation of the nipple/valve or in handling the tote if extra stress was placed on the valve after making a connection.  The failure was at the weakest point of the connection, where the nipple threads into the inner tank of the tote.      To prevent reoccurrence, we intend to install a brace at the bottom of the tote to support the dry-disconnect valve assembly.

In particular, the transportation and disposal of certain waste streams (1248 containers of waste oxidizing solids N.O.S.) that are generated from BioLabs production of various products (i.e. pool supplies).     The waste was transported by trailer from BioLab’s facility to a facility located at 2300 Short Hillsboro, El Dorado AR pending final transportation to the intended waste management facility Clean Harbors Eldorado LLC for disposal.   At approximately 10:00 am on December 18, 2012 the trailer had arrived at this location, and later that same day at around 4:00pm a Clean Harbors employee noticed white smoke emanating from the rear door of the trailer containing BioLab’s waste.  The facility’s emergency response plan was activated and an emergency response team and a fire brigade (hereinafter “responders”) from the neighboring facility (Clean Harbors El Dorado LLC) arrived at the scene.  The response team and fire brigade after having assessed the situation determined that BioLab’s waste was reacting inside the trailer, it was also determined that no other trailers or individuals were involved, it was at this point that the responders initiated their response and control activities which involved the use of water cannons to cool the trailer and stop the reaction of BioLab’s waste.  In addition, the responders initiated containment activities to control the run-off from the response activities.      In conjunction with the local authorities the responders assisted in the evacuation of any individuals that could potentially come into contact with the smoke that emanating from the trailer.  The responder’s efforts resulted in the complete cessation of the reaction occurring with BioLab’s waste.  The responders stayed on site throughout the night to insure the reaction did not re-initiate and not further reactions occurred.      In addition to the responders and local authorities, representatives from the US EPA arrived on scene.  The EPA representatives conducted an initial air monitoring assessment and continued with follow-up assessments the following day and concluded that there were no off-site impacts.  Additionally the storm water run-off was assessed by the US EPA and again no off-site impacts were identified.      Once the site was secured, facility personnel repackaged the remnants of BioLab’s waste  where it was then transported to Clean Harbors El Dorado LLC where it was disposed via incineration.  The subject trailer was deconned, the water used to control the reaction was collected and placed into storage tanks pending analytical and disposal options.  Finally all cleanup debris including soil from the area where the trailer was parked was containerized and will be disposed of once analytical results are reviewed and a disposal method is determined.","Prior to Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc.’s accepting Biolab’s waste for transport the containers holding said waste were visually inspected.  The inspection found no evidence that the shipment was not stable.  Likewise, the containers appeared to have been properly closed, marked, labeled and secured.  Based upon the foregoing inspections, as well as the representations made by BioLab’s the waste was accepted for transportation.      Although a cause and origin analysis was not performed, Clean Harbors’ initial findings have concluded that this incident appears to have been the result of an exothermic reaction within the containers that held Biolab’s waste on the subject trailer.  Clean Harbors’ initial findings have not uncovered anything that would contradict these findings, but it reserves the right to modify, alter, or amend its conclusions based upon newly discovered facts or information not previously available.  Additionally, the investigation remains ongoing as it seeks to involve the parties that may have through their acts or failure to act caused or contributed to the incident, but during this process the waste stream involved has been blocked from further shipment and disposal until such time as the investigation is complete and a determination has been made that additional safety measures could be instituted to reduce and/or preclude a like or similar incident.",Yes,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,1248,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,66700,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

A BNSF mechanical responder vented the internal pressure from PROX 15445 which stopped additional commodity wetness from accumulating on the top of PROX 15445. The securement of valves and fittings were checked with no securement exceptions noted. Baking soda/water solution was applied to neutralize the spillage on the tank shell. A message to have PROX 15445 re-inspected at its next terminal location (Belen, NM) was initiated. Belen mechanical/hazardous material responders inspected PROX 15445 upon arrival and it was noted that commodity wetness was still present around the top valve fitting area. PROX 15445 was carefully set-out of the train and isolated in the railyard. No increase in commodity wetness was observed when PROX 15445 remained motionless. Further inspection by responders revealed a hairline crack at the liquid eduction line pipe flange weld. Spillage on the tank shell was neutralized. The commodity within PROX 15445 was transferred to another suitable tank car on 12/17/2012 without further incident.

With the 5 gallon pails sealed they were overpacked into a 30 gallon open head steel drum and packed with vermiculite then sealed for transportation by 1030am.  At 11:30am the chemists noticed the drum had bulged, and were off-gassing. Facility personell,Woburn Fire Dept, Mass DEP and Clean Harbors management were notified. The chemists moved the box truck to an isolated section of the parking lot. Woburn Fire arrived along with the Mass DEP a short time later At approx. 1220, the Woburn Fire Dept. started taking temperature readings from the drum, and every 15 or so there after.  Throughout the time span, the temp continued to drop, and the drum stopped off gassing.  The chemists donned the proper PPE with respirators and restabilize the aluminum powder with brand new mineral oil and repackaged the material for continued transportation to it intended disposal facility. The drums were continually monitored and the Mass DEP Rep and the Woburn FD Capt. were satisfied and happy with the end result, and had no further remarks or questions and explained the incident would be treated as a ""complaint"", and no further action was requested. Mass DEP Report# NE-20127495","Clean Harbors conducted an internal review of the incident and concluded that moisture was likly present in the mineral oil initially applied to the aluminum powder which caused the reaction. A Clean Harbors review team evaluated several options to minimize the handling of mineral oil and the potential for the introduction of moisture into secondary containers. The following Clean Harbors Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)will be re-written to reflect the following changes; 1)Mineral Oil will be transferred onto one gallon containers which will be sealed until ready to use. 2)Chemist will use multiple one gallon containers, as needed, for field operations. 3)One gallon containers will be single use, and will not be re-filled after use. 4) Any unused residual mineral oil in containers from field operations will not be reused at other sites and be properly disposed of.",No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

As he entered the trailer the lighting was not real good and he misjudged his fork heights and pierced the first two drums of the waste he was about to unload. He immediately stopped what he was doing and got help to get the drums laid down to stop the leaking. This incident occurred on our second shift and as this was being done our second shift lead person contacted the branch Operations Manager to notify him of the incident. He in turn contacted our Regional Regulatoty Manager for guidance on this since it was a hazardous waste. We determined what the waste was and got a cleanup plan together. Cleanup began immediately and all material was recovered, the drums were placed in overpack drums along with the absorbent used in cleanup.  There were no injuries or other incidents associated with the incident itself or the cleanup. Spillage was contained to a trailer floor and a small amount on the pavement.

SANDERS,SAFETY & RISK,3077 NW SAINT HELENS ROAD,PORTLAND,OR,97210,Carrier,"Incident Description:    0115 December 23, 2012    Harris Transportation driver Saul Perez arrived on Valero site 4123. At this time Saul verified delivery address and calculated that the entire load would fit. He then set up for his delivery and began delivery of the ""midgrade"" gasoline. While delivering the midgrade,Saul then set up the ""regular"" grade delivery. Saul then opened the delivery valve on the truck partially  to look for any leaks. He observed no leaks, so he opened the delivery valve ""full"" open. It was at this time Saul instantly realized that the ""ears"" (the locking mechanism) had come open at the fitting-end on the tank. Saul then immediately shut down the flow of fuel to the regular tank. He placed absorbent material around the storm drain, manhole,as well as protecting the area keeping any product from heading toward the station building itself.    Frankie Fortine,the night attendant at the station,called The Littleton Fire & Rescue. Littleton Fire and Rescue Department arrived on site within  20 minutes or less of the initial call from Frankie Fortine.    They spread additional absorbents and ""kitty  litter"" to pick up any remaining product on the concrete. The entire spilled product was contained on the delivery site's property.  The fire department then issued an Order of Cleanup. They estimated the release to be approximately in the area of 50- 100 gallons.     Weather:    At the time of the spill,it was approximately 30 degrees Fahrenheit, dry, and there was no water on the ground.    0130 December 23,2012    Harris driver Saul Perez notified Harris dispatch of the spill and Harris Dispatch began the notification process within Harris.    The following people were notified:    Craig Watkins, CO Area Manager:  Chuck Snook,Emergency Responder: Matt Haley,CO Field Safety Supervisor: Christie Sanders,Safety & Risk:  Jan Frost, Operations  Mgr.: Tracy Rich,Denver Dispatch: Loretta Wade, Dispatch Mgr.:(503) 522-9353 (206) 510-8908 (971) 201-7262 (503) 475-1947 (503) 552-5827 (503) 552-5815(503)552-5815     At this time, Chuck Snook called BELFOR Environmental (Harris' environmental contactor) for the cleanup response. Matt Haley contacted Victor Stanley, a senior driver in our Denver terminal, to go on site and assist Saul Perez and all of the Responders with the cleanup.    0430 December 23, 2012    BELFOR Environmental arrived on the scene with Supervisor Pete Alvara do,Hazmat Technicians Truitt Hart,and Slavador Mendoza.They began picking up the oil dry absorbent that was placed by the fire department and Harris. The cleanup materials were placed in (2) drums from the total cleanup.","0630 December 23,2012    BELFOR Environmental had finished the cleanup about 0630 and along with everyone else left the site shortly thereafter. According to the report from BELFOR, and verbal confirmation from Mark Churchill, Senior Project Manager with BELFOR Environmental,none of the spilled product reached the storm drain at any time; all product was contained on site.    On December 27, 2012,Mark Taylor with BELFOR delivered the drums under the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest tl 005660911to AET Environmental for disposal at Rineco in Bento, AR on UHWM.    After reviewing the incident,Area Manager, Craig Watkins,placed Saul Perez ""off  duty"" until Saul completes a Delivery Recertification Training process to insure that he fully understands the impact of the ""Triple Check"" process in preventing future incidents.  Retraining will be completed by a Certified Trainer and approved  by Harris management before Saul will be able to return to work.

The trespasser maliciously opened valves on numerous tanks on site causing the tanks to leak their contents onto the ground and eventually affecting a tributary of Paw Creek.  The vandal had broken the seals on valve caps, then opened all valves releasing the material.  Of all containers affected, only one possessed a DOT classified hazardous material (UN2789 Acetic Acid).  The other affected tanks contained non hazardous car wash waxes and mineral oils.      The release was found early morning ~0700 on 12/25/12 when a Dana employee stopped by the facility.      NRC report number 1034146 was assigned to this incident however a report is not available as this is considered a criminal act.      Once the release had been found, Dana personnel contacted E.R.T.S. to conduct necessary reporting and to dispatch a response contractor to begin cleanup operations.","Root Cause / Corrective Action efforts have been conducted. Express Container Services, operator of the site, has installed surveillance cameras.

He notified his supervisor of the situation and applied oil dry in the inside of the trailer where the drum was suspected to be leaking.

At no time did any of the acid come into contact with the bare ground or the storm water collection system.  Acid inside the containment area was sent to our onsite, permitted wastewater treatment system.  Acid outside the containment area was neutralized with calcium carbonate and then sent to the mill's wastewater treatment plant.",More secure methods to attach the transfer hose to the tank car are being investigated.

With the vibration of the liquid pump off-loading, the vehicle began to roll forward. The hoses were attached and began to stretch. At the maximum distance of the hoses, the piping on the bulk stantion failed by design and the emergency shut-offs reacted. All valves were shut by design and the release was contained. The driver ran forward of the vehicle and jumped into the moving truck cab. He applied the foot pedal and properly set the parking brakes. Due to the release of product, the district initiated an emergency evacuation and contacted local authorities for an emergency response.

During the transfer, a tankwagon was being loaded in the same vicinity as the unloading process. At the completion of filling the tankwagon, the operator was going up the stairs to button up the tankwagon. At this point, he witnessed ferric starting to leak out of the rail car between our fitting and the fitting on the car. He shut down the transfer and released the air pressure on the railcar. He then C clamp on the fittings to slow down the leak. He then re-tightened the bolts on the fittings to stop the leak. A call to the company incident commander was then initiated. Duration of the release was approximately 5 minutes. During the investigation, it was discovered that a tear had occurred on the gasket.","Hawkins, Inc. is in the process of rewriting our work instructions to include better inspections of gaskets and the tightening of the flange.

The trailer had been at the Tank Wash for several days awaiting delivery. The Tank Wash uses a temperature probe that is inserted into the taller through a washout opening. Their procedure was to insert the probe long enough to measure the temperature and then remove it and replace the washout cap. A worker thinking that they were saving time removed the front washout cap, inserted the probe and left it there. At the end of their shift they did not communicate this and the next worker that then took the readings from the center washout using another probe. This worker was unaware of the temperature probe in the front washout or that it was unsecure. When the driver arrived to transport the trailer for delivery the trailer was disconnected from the steam and a final temperature reading was taken by the Tank Wash worker In the presence of the driver. As the driver began climbing atop the trailer the Tank Wash worker stopped the driver to tell them that they had secured the trailer and it was ready to go. The driver then completed his pre-trip and departed. On a hill two blocks from his delivery location the driver saw from his mirrors the resin material come out of the front washout of the trailer. The driver stopped and climbed atop of the trailer to find the Tank Washes temperature probe still in the front washout. The driver removed the probe, secured the washout and then continued the two blocks to the customer. With the temperature being colder the majority of the resin as adhered to the sides of the trailer with droplets of resin quarter to half dollar size that dripped off the trailer onto the roadway and parking lot. The customer notified local authorities. The local Fire Department and Environmental personnel responded and left the scene shortly after evaluating the situation and being satisfied with the cleanup efforts that were performed by plant personnel and Pettit Environmental Inc. of Louisville, KY. The waste collected was disposed by the plant through their hazardous waste program.","Tank Wash has changed their policies to include:  The use of a checklist has been added. Temperature Probes will not be left on trailers or containers. The Probe will be inserted at the center clean out port (trailers) air Inlet (containers) only. While In attendance the Probe will be placed for 10 minutes to ensure an accurate reading. Remind the driver to inspect the top of the trailer to ensure it is secure. First Choice Logistics have reinforced their policy: The driver will always be responsible to perform the final inspection to ensure that all ports, caps, valves and manholes are secure prior to transporting.

The release occurred when the oil exited a vent pipe which was located adjacent to an exterior wall in a doorway and impacted a vending machine located below the vent pipe, as well as the concrete sidewalk.  The oil migrated from the release area to the east along the sidewalk and below the curbing to Boylston Street which separates the sidewalk from the street to the catch basin (CB-1) located approximately 40 feet east of the vent pipe on the corner of Hereford and Boylston Streets. Approximately one to two gallons of oil entered the catch basin before the spill was contained via absorbent material (i.e., Speedy-Dry®) initially by the driver of the Global delivery truck.    Clean Horbors Inc (CHI) arrived to the Site at 9:30 a.m. to perform response actions.  CHI removed the cover of the affected catch basin, CB-1.  Less than one-quarter inch of oil was observed on top of the water within the catch basin. The oil was below the invert elevation of the outfall pipe leading out of CB-1 to the downgradient catch basin, CB-2. Absorbent pads were placed in the bottom of CB-1 by CHI and then removed after the oil/water mixture became absorbed to the pads. Absorbent pads were also used to plug the downgradient pipe prior to deploying the absorbent pads to remove the oil/water mixture from CB-1. Environemntal Compliance Services (ECS) inspected CB-2; no staining was observed around the catch basin as it was not located within the spill pathway. In addition, no liquid (petroleum or water) was observed within  CB-2; only wet leaves and debris were present.  A bailer was used to confirm that no oil or petroleum sheen was present in either CB-1 or CB-2. A four gas meter was used to screen CB-1 and CB-2 for explosive vapors. No readings above background were recorded.      At approximately 10:00 a.m., CHI also swept up and removed the Speedy-Dry® that was present in the release area (the sidewalk, curb, and street). The absorbent material was placed in 55-gallon drums. CHI then applied an oil emulsion surfactant to the sidewalk and curb area to assist in further removing the oil residue from the paved areas and also from the cracks of the pavement along the curb. Additional absorbent pads were then applied to remove the product.     The condition of the catch basin was monitoried over the next few days to ensure that there was no residual product in the system",The overfill was due to a combination of the customer placing an order for more than the tank could hold and a weak vent whistle that did not alert the driver to the potenital overfill situation.

DRIVER WAS ATTEMPTING TO TURN LEFT ONTO NORTHBOUND NEW PHILADELPHIA ROAD. AS THE UNIT ENTERED THE NORTHBOUND LANE OF NEW PHILADELPHIA RD. IT BEGAN TO TIP AND ROLLOVER AND CAME TO REST ON THE TOP OF THE CARGO TANK. THE MOST PROBABLE EXPLANATION FOR THE LEAKED PRODUCT IS THAT THE LOADING HATCH DUE TO THE FORCE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS FORCED AJAR JUST ENOUGH FOR THE PRODUCT TO LEAK OUT. THIS HATCH WAS ALSO LOCKED USING A STANDARD PADLOCK. SINCE THE ENTIRE WEIGHT OF THE TRUCK END TANK WERE RESTING ON THIS, THE ADDED HEIGHT FROM THE LOCK MAY ALSO HAVE BEEN A CONTRIBUTING FACOTR IN FORCING THE HATCH AJAR. HOWEVER, THE LOCK REMAINED INTACT AND MAY HAVE HELPED IN PREVENTING THE HATCH FROM OPENING COMPLETELY. THE WEIGHT OF THE REMAINING PRODUCT ALSO PROBABLY CONTRIBUTED TO FORCING THE PRODUCT OUT. THE PRODUCT PROBABLY CONTINUED TO LEAK AS LONG AS THE TANK REMAINED ON IT'S TOP. THE CONSISTENCY OF THE PRODUCT AND THE SMALL AMOUNT THAT THE HATCH WAS AJAR LIMITED THE SPILL. ALSO, AS SOON AS THE TRUCK WAS ROLLED TO IT'S SIDE THE HATCH RETURNED TO IT'S PROPER ALIGNMENT AND THE LEAKING STOPPED. THE LEAKING PRODUCT WAS CONFINED TO AN AREA UNDER THE TANK AND WAS INACCESSIBLE UNTIL THE TRUCK WAS RIGHTED. THE TANK ITSELF REMAINED FULLY INTEGRAL.
