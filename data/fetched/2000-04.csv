THE OPERATOR ON DAY SHIFT (0500 HRS _ 1700 HRS),  JERROD SMITH, FAILED TO ACCOMPANY GAUGER WHEN TANK #4 WAS GAUGED.  THEREFORE, HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT VOLUMN OF PRODUCT WAS IN TANK #4.  WHEN MR. SMITH""S RELIEF, MR. KEVIN YEAGLE, CAME, HE STATED THAT  A GAUGE NEEDED TO BE OBTAINED FROM THE GAUGER SO THAT A FILL SAFE LEVEL COULD BE ESTABLISHED.  AGAIN, MR.

YEAGLE FAILED TO FOLLOW SPECIFIC WRITTEN PROCEDURES FOR OFF-LOADING OF A MOTOR VESSEL.  INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN ADVANCE OF THE AMOUNT ONBOARD THE VESSEL BEING DELIVERED TO THE FACILITY.  THE GAUGER MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT IN THE TANK AND MAKES THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE OPERATOR ON DUTY. THIS BREAK DOWN IN COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN OPERATORS IS THE PRIMARY CAUSATION FACTOR FOR THIS INCIDENT.

THE LEAK WAS 1 DROP PER SECOND AND COMING FROM THE CENTER FLOOR AREA OF THE TOP CONTAINER. THE TOP CONTAINER A 40 FOOT CAN WAS ON TOP OF 2 20 FOOT CONTAINERS POSITIONED IN THE WELL OF THE DOUBLE STACK CAR, FEC 4498. TO FACILITATE INSPECTION OF THE LADING, THE TOP CONTAINER WAS REMOVED, DIAPERED AND MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK WHERE IT COULD BE SECURED IN THE CONTAINMENT AREA. THE 2 BOTTOM CONTAINERS WERE ALSO REMOVED AND PLACED CURB SIDE AT THE CUSTOMS DOCK WHERE THEY COULD BE CLEANED OF THE RESIDUE. THE RAILCAR WAS THEN CLEANED TO FACILITATE THE RELOADING OPERATION.UPON OPENING THE LEAKING CONTAINER NOTED THE LADING TO BE 55 GALLON DRUMS.

THE LAST ROW OF DRUMS AT THE DOOR CONSISTED OF A ROW OF 4 DRUMS WHICH IS NOT A APPROVED LOADING PROTOCOL WITH THE USE OF THE TY-GARD RESTRAINT SYSTEM.

DEVELOPED THE ABOVE CONTAINER WAS BEING PICKED UP AND CHECKED OUT OF THE TERMINAL WHEN THE DRAYMAN NOTICED A LIQUID SUBSTANCE LEAKING THROUGH THE FLOORING NEAR THE NOSE OF THE CONTAINER. THE CONTAINER WAS MOVED TO THE CUSTOM'S DOCK WHERE IT COULD BE SECURED PENDING INSPECTION. MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE ICTF AND INSPECTED THE 20 CONTAINER NOTING A SMALL POOL OF PRODUCT (LESS THAN ONE PINT) HAD ACCUMULATED IN THE CONTAINMENT AREA UNDER THE NOSE OF THE CONTAINER.THERE WAS A SLIGHT ODOR TO THE LIQUID INDICATING IT WAS PRODUCT FROM THE MATERIAL BEING SHIPPED. SEAL CC17011 WAS REMOVED AND THE REAR DOORS OPENED TO INSPECT THE LADING, THE LADING CONSISTED OF 55 GALLON METAL DRUMS DOUBLE STACKED PLYWOOD BILEVEL SEPARATION AND SECURE THE PLACE WITH A TY-PATCH. THE BOTTOM TIER OF DRUMS HAD SHIFTED SLIGHTLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE AS THE DRUMS ON THE LAST ROW AND THE SECOND LAST ROW WERE SET OFF BY APPROXIMATELY 4 INCHES. THE SHIPPER HAD PROPERLY BAYED OUT THE DRUMS IN THE LOADING PROTOCOL BY PLACING A ROW OF 3 DRUMS AT THE MID POINT AND AT THE REAR ROW OF THE LOAD. THE APPLICATION OF THE TY-PATCH WAS SOMEWHAT IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE PROPER APPLICATION, HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO AREAS THAT SHOULD BE REVISITED AND ADDRESSED. WHEN WRAPPING AND APPLYING THE PATCH AT THE REAR OF THE LADING THE STRIPS SHOULD REMAIN HORIZONTAL TO THE FLOOR AND NOT TAPER DOWN. BOTH STRIPS ON BOTH TIERS  WERE TAPERED DOWN FROM WHERE THEY WERE ATTACHED TO THE SIDE WALL TO WHERE THEY WRAPPED AROUND THE DRUMS AT THE REAR. THERE WAS MINIMUM OF 6 INCHES DIFFERENCE IN THE HEIGHT OF MATERIAL FROM THE SIDE WALLS AND THE REAR AREA WHERE THE PATCH WAS APPLIED.THIS DOES NOT ALLOW THE MATERIAL TO REMAIN ON PLANE AND REDUCE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE MATERIAL. ALSO THE PATCH PIECE NEEDS TO BE FULLY APPLIED TO THE SIDE WALL PIECES. ON THE LOWER STRIP FROM THE TOP TIER AND THE LOWER STRIP FROM THE BOTTOM TIER BOTH PATCH PIECES WERE OFF BY AT LEAST 6 INCHES AND WOUND UP BEING ADHEARED TO THE DRUMS RATHER THAN FULLY ADHEARED TO THE SIDE WALL STRIP OF THE TY-PATCH. THIS ALSO REDUCES THE EFFICIENCY OF THE MATERIAL TO PROPERLY SECURE THE LADING. DURING THE UNLOADING PROCESS OF THE DRUMS TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PLYWOOD SHEETING PLACED ON THE FLOOR AND UTILIZED FOR THE BILEVEL SEPARATION WERE CUT TOO SHORT. THERE WERE GAPS TOWARDS THE SIDES OF THE CONTAINER THAT WERE 2-3 INCHES. THIS SHORT CUTTING OF THE PLYWOOD ALLOWS 2-3 INCHES OF THE DRUMS TO HANG OVER THE SIDES OF THE PLYWOOD AND CREATES AN UNEVEN SURFACE FOR THE DRUMS TO REST ON. THIS CREATES A STRESS ON THE BOTTOM CHIMES OF THE DRUMS AND WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE THE DRUMS TO FAIL. IN THE CASE OF THE LAST ROW 3 DRUMS ON THE TOP TIER THE DRUM ON THE LEFT SIDE WAS ONLY PARTIALLY RESTING ON THE PLYWOOD AND A FULL ONE THIRD OF THE DRUM HAD NO SUPPORT AT ALL.
