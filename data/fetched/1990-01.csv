INITIAL CLEAN UP WAS PERFORMED AND AT THE REQUEST OF APA AND APPROVAL OF THE DEP THE BOX TRAILER CARRYING THE TOTES HAD BEEN SENT BACK TO THE APA WAREHOUSE WHERE CLEAN UP OPERATIONS WOULD RESUME ON MONDAY.     UPON ARRIVAL AT THE WAREHOUSE, THE APA REPRESENTATIVE REQUESTED THAT CLEAN HARBORS REMOVE ANY REMAINING CONTAMINATED DEBRIS FROM THE TRAILER AND SEGREGATE FOR INVENTORY AND DAMAGE LIABILITY REASONS. MATERIALS WERE REMOVED AND SEGREGATED INTO 3 SEPARATE PILES; ONE CONSISTING OF PAPER PRODUCTS, FOOD STUFFS, AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES; THE SECOND BEING METAL OBJECTS, THE THIRD BEING CHEMICAL CONTAINERS. IT WAS SUGGESTED BY CLEAN HARBORS THAT ANY FOOD STUFFS AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES BE PROPERLY DISPOSED OF TO AVOID ANY FUTURE PROBLEMS. ALSO FOR DISPOSAL WOULD BE CONTAMINATED PAPER PRODUCTS AND ANY CONTAMINATED CARDBOARD CONTAINERS. IT WAS ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT ANY METAL OBJECTS BE SEPARATED AND CLEANED WITH A WATER FLUSH AND A DRY WIPING. BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL TIME THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED FOR INVENTORY REASONS, THE CLIENT ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTAINERIZING OF ANY CONTAMINATED MATERIALS AND CLEANING OF METAL MATERIALS.     UPON THE REMOVAL OF THE TOTE TANKS FROM THE TRAILER, A VISUAL INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED ON BOTH TOTES FOR ANY APPARENT DAMAGE. FIRST THE EMPTY TOTE WAS REMOVED. NO APPARENT PHYSICAL DAMAGE WAS PRESENT, THOUGH ON THE UNDER SIDE OF THE TOTE A CHECK VALVE WAS TURNED OPEN AND THE EVERTITE CAP WAS NOT PROPERLY PLACED ON. ONE EAR OF THE CAP HAD BEEN CLOSED BUT THE OTHER WAS OPEN. SO THE CAP WAS NOT COMPLETELY ON, WHICH MAY HAVE RELEASED THE PRODUCT FROM THE 2"" MALE DISCHARGE LINE.

MOUNTAIN STANDARD TIME ON JANUARY 14, 1990 A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHEMICAL TRACTOR/BULK TANKER COMBINATION OVERTURNED WHILE NORTHBOUND INTO LOGAN, UTAH ON STATE ROUTE 89/91. THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE OVERTURNED VEHICLE WAS THE ""BIG CURVE"" AREA IN THE SARDINE CANYON NEAR WELLSVILLE, UTAH. THE TANKER WAS CARRYING AN RQ ALKALINE LIQUID, N.O.S. KNOWN BY THE TRADEMARK MACDERMID ULTRA ETCH 20 MANUFACTURED BY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHEMICAL. AN AIR VALVE LOCATED ON THE REAR OF THE TANKER BROKE OFF DURING THE OVERTURN AND A PORTION OF THE PRODUCT WAS SPILLED. THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHEMICAL DRIVER RECEIVED ONLY MINOR INJURIES WHEN THE TRUCK OVERTURNED. THE WELLSVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT STOPPED THE LEAK WITHIN 15-30 MINUTES AFTER THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED BY PUTTING A WOOD PLUG INTO THE BROKEN PIPE AND ALSO CONSTRUCTED A SMALL DIKE APPROXIMATELY 40-50 YARDS DOWNGRADE FROM THE TRUCK TO CONTAIN THE PRODUCT. JACK B KELLEY CO OF WOODS CROSS, UTAH, PERFORMED THE ACTUAL SPILL CLEAN-UP AND PRODUCT TRANSFER.  THE PRODUCT TRANSFER WAS COMPLETED BY EMPLOYEES OF THE JACK B. KELLEY CO. AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 P.M. ON JANUARY 15TH. THE JACK B. KELLEY TANKER WHICH CONTAINED THE RECOVERED PRODUCT WAS DRIVEN TO WOODS CROSS, UTAH FOR FURTHER EVALUATION.     THE SPILLED MATERIAL WHICH WAS CONTAINED BY THE TEMPORARY DIKES CONSTRUCTED BY THE WELLSVILLE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE UDOT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY NEUTRALIZED BY MR. LEE NIX OF THE JACK B. KELLEY CO. AS OBSERVED BY LT. AMES OF LTHE UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL. ALSO ATTACHED IS A COPY OF THE UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INCIDENT REPORT.    SINCE THE ACTUAL CAUSE OF THE SPILLAGE WAS AN AIR VALVE WHICH BROKE OFF, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CHEMICAL IS REPLACING ALL THE VALVES WITH A MUCH STURDIER VALVE.
