The 6 bolt manway was found with two slightly loose bolts which when tightened approx 1/4 turn secured the manway seal and stopped the leak. This residue tank car was found with 91 psi of compressed air remaining in the tank. When this pressure relieved through the loose manway closure it also carried ammonia odor from the residue. All other closures were inspected and found to be properly secured. Agencies responding: East Baton Rouge Fire Department, Louisiana State Police and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. The Chemtrec notification was made to the shipper and consignee as found on the railroad waybill. Chemtrec call returned by Southern Ionics, their Sam White, 662)295-1075, swhite@southernionics.com and Terra Nitrogen, their Jeff Seebrech (712)253-8535. However it was later learned that Exxonmobil actually unloaded this car and offered it into transportation (aka shipper). Exxonmobil was later notified directly, to their Brian Blakemore. Both Exxonmobil and Terra Nitrogen have been asked to provide feedback as to why it's necessary to pressurize vessel to ~100 psi to unload lading. If continued, this pressure in a general service tank car coupled with the low odor threshold of ammonia solution provides high probability of recurrence. Exxonmobil was asked to reevaluate their unloading process to see if car can be unloaded with ~10-15 psi.     KCS emergency mitigation services were activated to provide for special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, dedicated internal management oversight, train/yard crew delay, and regulatory reporting as appropriate.  KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 may apply as services require.    Note to report, item 27, amount in package, was estimated. This action required by preparer to facilitate data acceptance by defective DOT IT system edits. Specifically, this estimated quantity was required: (1)because the shippers only provided bulk quantities on shipping paper, as ""1 Tank Car"", per DOT requirements; and (2)because the DOT e-system requires data in this field to facilitate report acceptance.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. For non-accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.

While making a delivery to Lincoln Electric in Mentor, Ohio, approximately 40 gallons of free liquid were released as a result of a hose failure.  The release impacted a gravel/soil area of the facility.  Lincoln Electric personnel applied soda ash to the puddles of sulfuric acid.  Lincoln Electric personnel utilized a power floor sweeper washer to recover the neutralized acid.  Lincoln Environmental off-loaded the generated liquids into their on-site waste water treatment facility for disposal. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency was on-site and approved this method of disposal.  The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency also field tested the surfaces where the spill occurred with PH paper and obtained neutral readings.","Since the release was accidental, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

He ran directly into the skid of 4 drums of organic oxidizer. The result was the drums were pushed of the pallet causing one of the drums to be punctured about a foot from the bottom of the drum causing a two gal leak. We immediately called the incident into Safety and the State Police. The local fire department was also notified. We continued with the cleanup process as directed by the State Police to package in an overpack drum. 5 hours later there was a reaction with the metal overpack causing an explosion. Emergency response numbers were called and the facility was evacuated with no injuries. The spill was cleaned up by Jones Brothers. The facility was reopened 7 hours after the evacuation that occurred around 12:30 am.,Steps have been made to insure that this does not occur. A hazmat checklist will be followed to insure all numbers are called to keep this from happening.

No spillage impacted the ground as it remained on SRIX 21525's tank shell. Movement of SRIX 21525 was stopped. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder was notified. The BNSF responder reported that SRIX 21525 was missing all four placards. The intact manway closure shipper seal numbered 2229879 was removed. The tool tight manway swing bolts were loosened to check the condition of the manway gasket and product outage. The product outage was deemed appropriate. The manway gasket was found deteriorated and missing a section of the gasket (approximate 4 inch section). The deteriorated gasket didn't provide a good seal and allowed product to escape at the manway closure during rail movement. The responder replaced the manway gasket in kind, closed the manway lid and tool tightened all 8 manway swing bolts. BNSF seal numbered 1095252 was affixed to the manway closure. The appropriate placarding was applied to all four sides of SRIX 21525. Spillage on the top shell and on safety appliances (side ladders) were wiped/cleaned. Response was concluded by 0450 hrs.

Hwy 36,MAPLEWOOD,MN,55109,Shipper,"our 26,000 GVW straight truck was driving east bound on I94 crossing over Hwy 61 bridge when the driver heard a loud explosion and thought a rear tire had blown. He looked in his rearview mirror and saw liquid coming out of the back of the truck and immediately pulled over onto the shoulder with the truck facing uphill. He got out of the truck and opened the rear of the truck. He saw the tote on the back end of the truck was leaking. He called the office and talked to Joe who told him to call 911. Joe called the Minnesota duty officer and called me. I was only 5 minutes away and headed to the scene to coordinate the response.  The tote was strapped to the wall of the truck about 6 feet from the back door.  The plastic inner packaging burst about 6"" from the bottom of the container. The crack is horizontal and approximately 24"" long. It follows the top contour of the round opening where the bottom valve is. There is no visible damage to the crack that may have contributed to the failure. It appears that the inner container failed.  The driver put his respirator on and tried to stop the liquid from going down the hill and into the storm sewer using using haz mat spill pads. The liquid did make it down approximately 300 feet from the truck and some material did get into the storm sewer. The St Paul fire department arrived with the Highway Patrol and the St Paul haz mat emergency response team. The fire department took over the site. MN DOT closed 2 of the 3 east bound lanes. The far left lane was left open.  It was determined that sodium bicarbonate would neautralize the bisulfite solution. The St Paul haz mat team had some sodium bicarbonate with them but did not have enough. I called our office and had them send one of our trucks down with a pallet of 50lb bags of sodium bicarbonate. The haz mat team used this to neautralize the solution. Bay West, a private hazardous materials clean up team was called in to clean up the site and the truck. They cleaned up the truck and released it for us to drive it back to our warehouse.  The driver was brought to the emergency room for a check up and to clean some of the liquid off of him. He was released right away.  A car driving east bound had a tie rod break and the car ended up pulling over behind our truck. It had 2 women in it. The liquid ran down the shoulder under their car. They stayed in the car until the haz mat team removed them and brought them to the emergency room for observation.  The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency determined that the liquid did make it into the storm sewer. I was told by the Emergency Response Specialist from the Mediation Division that it did not make it to the Mississippi River but they were not sure how far into the storm sewer it traveled.  The time of the incident was approximately 6 hours.","We are setting up our own hazardous materials containment systems on our trucks to help mitigate any release. These carry a 400  gallon expandable container to put under the truck to catch any release. The kit also contains a Class B suit, respirator, gloves, safety vest and 80 feet of 3"" socks. The drivers will all be trained in proper use of all materials.  I would like to provide suggestions for improvements but I do not know how you can predict the catastrophic failure of a container like this. It was tested in June of this year. I have never seen anything like it in my 25 years of being in business.

The truck was west bound on US Rt 30.  A Ford Ranger pickup truck pulled out (failed to stop) in front of our truck at the intersection of St Rt 511. The impact caused the front axle of our truck to break loose of the springs; our driver was unable to control and the rig rolled over on its left side.  The semi slid on its side for approximately 50 yards.  The surface was dry concrete pavement (rough).  This caused the abrasive action that wore through the shell of the tank at each bulk head; thus all but a few hundred gallons leaked out onto the pavement.  The product ran into the median area, flowed east to a catch basin, then to buried conduit to the ditch along Rt 511, which flowed north.  Ohio DOT diked the ditch and contained a great deal of the product.  Cleanup and recovery began as soon as the unit was removed from the highway (6AM).  BBU of Zanesville, Ohio is the contractor.  Chris Bonner of the OHIO EPA was on-site and remains in contact with us and the contractor.  We are currently waiting on concrete catch basins to be built so the project can be completed.

While traveling, approximately 5 miles outside Williston, North Dakota, Falco Energy Transport LLC was struck by a train.  The vehicle involved was a truck, with a mounted tank, and attached ""pup"" trailer.  The mounted tank contained approximately 3,780 gallons of crude oil, and the ""pup"" trailer contained approximately 6,930 gallons of crude oil.  As a result of the accident, the truck and mounted tank caught fire, and were severely damaged.  However, the ""pup"" trailer remained in tact, with minor heat damage.  Falco Energy Transport LLC dispatched a rescue tanker to offload the crude oil from the ""pup"" trailer.  Approximately 3,780 gallons of crude oil were compromised, with the majority being consumed in the fire, and the remaining impact to the soil adjacent to the railroad tracks.  Burlington Northern Railyard coordinated cleanup efforts and response actions.  There were no injuries or exposures as a result of the release.","Since the release was accidental, and was related to a train accident, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

After the transfer was verified, the bleeder valve was opened in order to prime the equipment.  Once the equipment was primed and the transfer up and running, the loader did not close the valve.  Residual product released into the reservoir tank, resulting in a five to seven gallon release of product impacting the asphalt.  Water was applied to the affected area as per the MSDS.  After speaking with the loader who did the previous transfer on October 7, 2010, he informed the Terminal Manager that the reservoir had been filled with water during his transfer; therefore the amount of actual Hydrogen Peroxide impacting the asphalt may be less than the estimated five to seven gallons.  There were no injuries, and no drains were impacted.",ROOT CAUSE:  The Loader failed to close the bleeder valve after priming the pump.  In a post incident interview the Loader stated that he was having personal issues after a recent car accident.  He was stressed over the property damage which made him lose his focus; he did not communicate this to his Supervisor at the beginning of the shift.       CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  1. SSP 3025-006 was updated to include process of closing the valve after the pump is primed.  All employees were re-trained on updated procedure.    2. High density five gallon bucket is now being utilized under the bleeder valve on every transfer.    3. The Verifier will remind the Loader to close the bleeder valve once equipment is primed during verification.   4. Contact Shipper and TRANSFLO to discuss the possibility of obtaining a pump with a spring loaded valve which would automatically close once the valve is released after the pump is primed.    5. All employees were asked to speak up during morning safety meetings if they had any issues that would hinder their performance,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AALW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,TRANSFLO,US,

The train was then stopped on the main track to allow the train conductor to investigate the cloud source. The conductor reported entrained HOKX 8302 (DOT 111A100W5 tank car) was leaking product that produced a strong pungent odor. BNSF and contract responders determined after their initial inspection of HOKX 8302 that the leak source near the B-end right side body bolster of this jacketed tank car was from a suspected internal liner failure. A contract responder using a 'plug kit' managed to stop the leak by 0220 hrs. CDT, 10/13/2010. Shipper representatives assisted by the contract responders transferred product from HOKX 8302 to another suitable tank car by 1400 hrs. CDT, 10/13/2010 without further incident.  Responders inserted a buffering solution inside HOKX 8302 after the product transfer was completed and also applied soda ash to neutralize spillage that impacted ballast and soil. Afterwards, HOKX 8302 was carefully moved away from main trackage and into the BNSF yard facility at Kansas City, KS. On 10/15/2010, the interior and exterior of HOKX 8302 was neutralized and water washed, resulting in neutral pH readings. Shipper was granted FRA-10100735 movement approval to transport HOKX 8302 to their facility in Wichita, KS. No further incidents were reported for HOKX 8302 during this movement on the BNSF.    The side specification stencil on HOKX 8302 indicated that the last tank qualification was completed in the year 2005 and next due in 2015; the lining inspection was completed in 2008 and next due in 2013.",No additional comments.,Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,18150,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Once the truck was stopped at the Toll Booth on 1-294 SB at milepost 30 it was discovered that the trailer had a 6’ crack in the frame at axle #4. This was allowing rainwater contaminated with the PCBs to be released from the dump trailer. The driver was able to contain the release with spill pads and no material entered soil, water, or sewers. Other Heritage Transport personnel arrived on the scene and were able to move the material inside the dump and apply a seal on the inside of the dump to cease the release of materials.   It appears that when the materials were loaded into the trailer a piece of asphalt was dropped inside the trailer and caused the damage to the trailer. This also caused the liner to be ripped/torn and allow the rainwater to mix with the material.",Trailers will be inspected prior to loading to insure there are no damages caused by the materials being loaded into the trailer.

No problems were noted at that time.   At 0645 on Monday, 10/25/10, Clean Harbor's Truck to Truck Supervisor opened trailer #67000T to transfer the waste to a different unit. Supervisor noticed that the trailer had an odd smell, but he did not think that anything was wrong. While unloading the trailer he noticed that there was some liquid on the floor, but he thought that it was rain water. The Supervisor began to move a 55 gallon container  when he noticed that the container felt light.  At this point Supervisor took a pH reading of the material on the floor and it had a pH value of 0. Supervisor notified CHES management and advised the other employees in the facility to keep away from the affected area. The Supervisor then went to inspect the exterior of the trailer. It was noted that the material had begun to leak through the side of the van on the bottom edge near the front on the passenger side. He immediately evaluated the extent of the contamination on the ground and bermed the area off to prevent the spread of the material.   CHES management mobilized an in-house emergency response team the to scene of the spill to handle the cleanup and decontamination. The response team neutralized the acid and proceded to decon the items in the van as well as the surrounding pavement. All other waste containers on this shipment were inspected for damage and decontaminated. The only damage that was found was to pallets, not waste containers, that were near the leaking drum. The containers on the affected pallets were placed on new pallets and all debris that was created from these operations was packaged for disposal. The container that failed was inspected and found to be a non-specification drum that had developed a crack on the underside.",After investigation into the circumstances surrounding this spill; it was learned a hole was most likely in the bottom of the drum.  It was also learned the drum was a non spec drum.  Driver was suspended for accepting this type of drum.  Driver will be retrained on proper packaging.

Absorbents were utilized to absorb released product, and customer assisted in containment and disposition.  Product was contained within bucket, there was no impact to ground surface or waters of the state as a result of the release.  There were no injuires or exposures reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be due to a loose bolt on valve, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

He was filling thetanker with 1800 gals and it was a 1400 gal compartment. The tanker over filled and spilled 60 gals of bisulfite on theground by the time the operator got things under control.We immediately started the dean up by diking of the area with dirt and pumping the product spilled in to acontainer. We recovered almost all the product spilled and treated the area with lime to neutralize any remnants leftof the spilled product.,Since the spill we have had additional training on the loading of tankers.

At the time of the call the driver had just pulled out of the dock at USA Docu-Finish, Plainfield, IL.  The driver reported that there were some liquids on the bottom of the skids of freight that had just been delivered at USA Docu-Finish.  He also reported that liquids were coming out of the nose wall and side wall areas of the front of his trailer.  The driver was told to park the trailer away from the building in the lot at Docu-Finish.  The driver was instructed to take out his spillkit and apply pads and pillows to the perimeter ground surface around the tractor-trailer.  A response contractor was called within thirty minutes of the notification by the driver.  At the time of the spill the driver had three shipments on the trailer.  A hazardous materials shipment was discovered to contain the 55-gallon drum which was leaking.  After the response company entered the trailer they discovered that the drum had been creased, crushed and cracked about six inches from the bottom of the drum. (See photos. Also see loading diagram of this trailer.)  The hazardous materials shipment contained sixteen drums, with four drums loaded on each skid.  Each skid had wrapped shrink-wrap around the drums and the corners of the skids. The drum that released was loaded on the driver side of the trailer, on the front side of the pallet, loaded closest to the trailer wall.  This pallet was loaded up tight against a pallet of a carton of broom supplies.  There were no obstructions or sharp edges from the trailer floor, wall or broom pallet.  As a result of these observations, we can only conclude that the N&M Transfer dock employee who loaded this trailer punctured this drum while loading the trailer.  We believe the dock loader may have done this in an attempt to push the drum back on the pallet because some of these pallets were noted as having the drums beginning to slide over the edges of the pallet.","The investigation materials noted in this spill report (diagrams, photos, observation notes) are being forwarded to our dock manager to conduct an investigation of how this trailer was loaded.  We found that two different dock employees were involved in the loading process of this trailer.  They will both be interviewed and asked how they loaded this trailer.  If N&M Transfer concludes that either one or both of these employees played a part in the improper loading of this trailer, they will face disciplinary action, up to and including suspension of employment.  Regardless of whether or not the dock loaders are found at fault for the improper loading of this trailer, both employees will also receive follow-up training from our dock trainer.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"NM TRANSFER CO., INC.",US,

Less than 5 gallons was collected in the bucket.    The empty trailer was cleaned and transported to Polar in Houston, Texas for inspection and repair.  The inspection revealed that trailer 7117 had a crack in the barrel near the steam pads at the front side of the tandems.  It was discovered that the steam pad had been welded continuesly along the length of the steam pad.  This allowed no expansion room.  It is beleived that has steam was applied additional stress was applied to the barrel due to temperature differential.  This developed a hairline crack in the shell.",Steam pads will be examined to ensure gaps in weld are in place to allow for expanison.

The package contained returned materials (lead-lined syringe containers) that were being shipped back to the GE Health care facility from a customer location in Rochester Hills, Michigan.The incoming package contamination (583 dpm/cm2 Tc-99m) was identified during the routine radioactive package receiving process by GE Healthcare personnel. The suspect package was secured in the facility and the site Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) initiated an investigation into the origin of the contamination. Radioactive contamination surveys were performed on the facility Receiving Area, GE Healthcare personnel, and the GE Healthcare vehicle that transported the package. All radioactive contamination surveys completed were at or below background. The package contents (0.082 uCi) were allowed to decay to background levels and then physically inspected to determine if the cause of the package contamination was a package integrity failure. The packaging was found to be intact without any physical defects present. The in-house GE Healthcare package contamination incident investigation concerning the origin of the radioactive contamination was deemed inconclusive.","After the GE Healthcare facility conducted an initial in-house investigation of the package contamination incident, the Shipper (Cardiology & Vascular Associates) was notified of the elevated removable surface contamination on the outer surface of the package which was >220 dpm/cm2. GE Healthcare informed the Shipper (Cardiology & Vascular Associates) the package radioactive contamination incident was reported to the National Response Center and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Command Center in accordance with 49 CFR 171.15(b)(2).The Shipper was encouraged to provide staff re-training on returning UN2910 package shipments to GE Healthcare and improving internal hazardous material shipping procedures to prevent any future recurrence.",No,RAM CONTAINER,"General packaging, for type A radioactive materials",7A,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,GE HEALTHCARE,US,

The employee notified a member of the HazMat Response Team. Rolando Salvo. Rolando responded to the area and visually inspected the leaking hose. Rolando left the area to gather HazMat supplies and don the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment. During this time, a Whey Department Supervisor, Frank Castro, was conducting his daily rounds of the exterior and noticed the hose connecting the portable tank to the CIP system was leaking. He went inside to notify his Supervisor at 1015. Rolando and Frank returned to the tanker at the same time and saw that the hose had broken loose at the camlock connection. Rolando attempted to turn off the hand valve at the Tanker, but it was stuck in place. Rolando then turned off the ball valve to the tanker, stopping the flow of AC-55-5 from the tanker. The tanker had been leaking for 7 minutes, which is the time between Frank seeing the leak and his return. The HazMat team was notified for spill cleanup at this point. The AC-55-5 had not reached any drains; the drains were covered with appropriate HazMat drain covers to prevent any contamination. Sodium Bicarbonate was applied to the spilled acid as a neutralizer. The pH of the solution was tested and was at a 7.0. The solution was then rinsed into a central location, where the solution was pumped into our on-site treatment facility.   A follow-up investigation revealed that the venting sequence had overpressurized the tanker, causing the hose connection to leak. The hose was secured with plastic zip ties, which were melted by the AC-55-5.",The following steps have been taken to prevent recurrence:   1. Venting sequence has been reprogrammed so that the vent valve opens for 20 seconds before the pot fill valve opens.   2. There will be a Whey Department employee at the tanker at all times when the outlet valve is open. a. This employee will have a radio and full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).   b. This employee has been trained what to do and who to notify in the event of a spill. 3.

GENESEE ST.,LOCKPORT,NY,14094,Carrier,"Due to human error our delivery driver overfilled by 50 gallons an underground unleaded fuel storage tank at the Arrowmart Convenence store located in Ashville, New York at approximately 06:30 on 10/12/10. The release itself lasted only a few seconds. Upon discovery, store personnel notified emergency responders. the release was also reported immediately to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (Spill # 1007429). Flow of the spill did reach 2 storm drains that border the property. These drains flow to a small feeder creek (unknown name) that flows to Chatauqua Lake. Emergency responders did place spill booms and pads at the outlet to the creek to prevent any flow of contamination from reaching the lake. Due to recent dry weather though, contamination never reached the creek, it settled in the storm drain piping. Both storm drains were flushed with water provided by the Lakewood Fire Department. OP-TECH Environmental utilized a vacuum truck to suck the contaminated water from another storm drain before it reached the creek. Both storm drains were flushed until totally free of contamination. The resulting contaminted water was then drummed (12 drums total). The clean spill pads from the creek, speedi dri used to clean the residual fuel on the parking lot surface and dirty spill pads from the parking lot were drummed (5 drums total) for disposal as well. Lastly there was one drum of sludge that was cleaned from the bottom of the vacuum truck which included leaves and debris that was in the storm drains. The total count of drums for disposal was 18. Sentinel Technologies provided disposal of the drums on 10/21/10. The total amount of time spent remediating this spill was approximately 10 hours from arrival on scene to finish.","On the date of the Spill the Delivery Driver (Chris Martin) was counseled on appropriate delivery procedures during delivery. It was discovered that he had not measured the level in the undergournd fuel tank prior to the delivery. If he had done so, he would have discovered it could not hold the amount he was attempting to delivery. Beyond that all of our delivery drivers were called to a meeting in which proper delivery procedures were reaffirmed. Likewise, drivers were all instructed to if possible avoid pakring their delivery trucks over the tank pad. This will help them to see a spill as it happens allowing for quicker response. Since this spill was the result of huma error at our delivery level, we do not believe that there is any industry level control that could be put in place to prevent this from happening.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8067,REID PETROLEUM CORP.,US,

At approximately 2:20 AM, operations observed that toluene was spilling from the top of the railcar to the immediate area below/near the railcar. Further investigation revealed that our customer shipped Kinder Morgan a full railcar when the bill of lading (BOL) indicated the car was empty. This contributed to the railcar overfilled and ensuing spill.   KM took immediate action by initiating an emergency shutdown of the transfer operation. Once the operation was stopped, KM performed area safety monitoring, responders donned the proper personnel protective equipment and recovered/mitigated the spilled product using absorbent pads and a vacuum truck. During day-light hours on 10/26/10 KM began remediation of the impacted spill area by removing the contaminated soil. Kinder Morgan has met with our customer informing them of the incident and the importance of completing the BOL accurately. Our customer is working on their business practices to ensure accurate information is provided to Kinder Morgan on the BOL. Kinder Morgan is using the incident as a “lessons learned” event to ensure that the BOL documentation along with other site practices and procedures confirm a car is ready to be filled prior to beginning a railcar loading operation.","KM response: Events leading up to the spill that caused the emission event were as follows:   a) Customer BOL Incorrect - The Kinder Morgan Liquids Terminal (KM) is a for hire liquid storage facility. We depend on our customers to provide appropriate documentation concerning railcars delivered to our terminal. In this event, the railcar Bill of Lading (BOL) received by KM from our customer indicated the railcar was empty.   Corrective Action: Worked with Customer to ensure proper BOL identifying condition of rail cars received.   b) Railroad Online System - Prior to loadings railcar it is KM’s practice to confirm the status of the railcar is empty using the Railroad’s online system. The railroad online system also showed the railcar empty when in fact the railcar was shipped full to KM.   Corrective Action: Operator responsible for loading railcar was coached on the importance of following site practices and procedures.   c) Kinder Morgan Railcar Liquid Level Manual Check - It is KM’s practice to visually check the liquid level in a railcar prior to loading. During the investigation it was determined that the operator may not have accurately visually gauge the railcar liquid level.   Corrective Action: Operator responsible for loading railcar was coached on the importance of following site practices and procedures.   d) Kinder Morgan Liquid Level Probe (Scully Probe) - During the investigation, it was determined that the Scully Probe was not placed in the railcar prior to filling.   Corrective Action: Operator responsible for loading railcar was coached on the importance of following site practices and procedures.   If any of the above events been identified prior to loading the railcar, the spill and ensuing emission event may have been avoided.",Yes,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,1000,KINDER MORGAN,US,
