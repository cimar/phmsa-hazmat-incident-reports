Stopped at Waste Management to check in.  Driver noticed dripping from barrel of trailerat 0800. Waste Management personel coming to work notice spillage on the roadway to the plant. Driver climbed on top of trailer and notice the gasket on the dome lid had been over tightened and had leaked.  Driver opened dome lid, repostioned gasket and secured dome lid. Pressure up trailer and no leaks detected. Driver call Safety Department at 0805. Safety called LASP hot line at 0820. Called out ES&H clean up company to handle spill. ES&H arrived at 1000 ES&H, DEQ and the local FD are onsite.  There are 5 spill areas with 2 being pretty heavy.  They plan to apply bi-carb to the spill and then have the FD wash the material off the roadway.  DEQ is okay with this approach.  They are also going to hire an off-duty police officer to provide traffic control.  They advise it may take a while to get this done, that being 8 to 10 hours.

BNSF mechanical and hazardous material responders inspected TILX 110376 finding the Salco Quick Inspect safety vent's rupture disc holder or the 'Quick Inspection Body' (QIB) with its top cap (plug) and the frangible disc missing. The aforementioned missing appurtenances were found on the ground approximately 150 yards away where TILX 110376 was currently located. This QIB had the top cap (plug) still securely attached. The bottom threads of the QIB appeared damaged with approximately 75% of the bottom thread missing. The 165 psig frangible disc was found intact (not burst). A new QIB with top cap (plug) was installed along with a new 165 psig frangible disc. Seal BNSF HAZMAT 001822 was applied. Repairs were completed by 0740 hrs.

The area was cordoned-off around PPGX 1903's location and BNSF responders were immediately notified. BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders approached PPGX 1903 with a chemical air monitoring device. A faint product odor was detected by the responders at ground level but monitoring devices registered no readings. Intact seal PPG 016069 was removed from the valve housing cover for valve inspection. The B-end vapor valve was found 3/4 turn from full closure and this valve was closed. Air monitoring samplings indicated a steep decline of product vapor at the valve housing area after this valve was closed. Later, a contract responder reinspected the valve securement of PPGX 1903 and concluded all valves were secure and no product odor/vapor was evident at that time. These responders removed all valve closure plugs, cleaned and taped plug threads with Teflon tape. The plugs were then reinserted and tool tightened.

As our trailer was traveling southbound on I-95 in Howard County, MD a 55 gallon plastic container containing Regulated Medical Waste expanded due to the hot temperature causing a 4 inch crack at the bottom side wall.  Therefore, the contents leaked out the rear of the trailer.  The driver pulled over at the rest stop.  Maryland State Trooper arrived and called in Maryland MDE Emergency Response Team, Howard County Hazmat Team, and Howard County Fire/EMS Team.  At 13:00, our in-house clean up team arrived to clean up the spill.  After the spill clean up, Maryland MDE Emergency Response Team released the trailer to our custody and escorted the trailer to our closest plant to the incident which is our Baltimore, MD plant.  The trailer arrived at our Baltimore, MD plant by 17:00.",Generator was contacted about this spill.  Generator will add solidifier or absorbent materials.

No injuries or exposures were reported. Safety qualified emergency responders mobilized and found leak sourcing from the A-end liquid valve. Specifically, the valve was not completed closed, cracked open, and the secondary closure device (dry-loc fitting) was defective and leaking from its assembly connection around the dry-loc plunger portion of the fitting. The liquid valve was closed completely, approximately 3/8 turn, stopping the release. The dry-loc secondary closure fitting was replaced.     The total release is not exactly known by carrier, but is estimated at 2 gallons. Shipper notification has been made through Canutec to Dow Chemical, Fort Saskatchewan, AB.    Shipper Has been advised that as a result of this incident, KCS services were activated to provide for railroad safety qualified services to mitigate this incident and that KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 will apply.    Note: Item 27--Amount in package was estimated by report preparer because exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

The products were loaded on pallets and were not secured to the pallet.  There was space left between the pallets that allowed movement during transport.  The driver is also partly at fault as he should not have accepted the load for transport without insuring that the trailer was loaded as to prevent forward, backward, and side to side movement.  This is a distinct violation of company policy and the driver will be reprimanded.  Contact will also be made with Safety-Kleen, as has been done in the past, to inform them of loading requirements and their adherence to them in order for us to assume responsibility for transport of the products.","The training that our drivers receive in order to be able to pick-up, secure, and safely deliver hazardous materials is extensive and sufficient.  We now must find a way to insure that every driver follows the procedure every time he picks up a load.  We have undertaken a penalty program that is severe - 1 verbal, 1 written with unpaid time-off, and 3rd violation is grounds to terminate.  These violations are for each aspect of hazardous material transportation, the loading/securing, logs in transit, speed in transit, and driver actions in the event of a mishap.  Our fines are up to $500.00 against the driver and we believe that shippers must also be held accountable for their negligence in not preparing loads properly; again, we require drivers to verify and secure prior to accepting responsibility.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"ROBBIE D.

The cloud obscured the source package. The facility was evacuated as a precaution and 911 was called. After arriving on scene, the fire department determined to follow a protocol for a bomb threat because the nature of the source package was unknown. Also present were VA State Police and FBI. After considerable time and use of a robot to try to retrieve the source package, no evidence of a bomb was found. Eventually the package involved was determined to hold a fire extinguisher (dry powder), which had activated while moving on the belt. The package had been shipped in accordance with new LTD QTY provisions, displaying the LTD QTY marking. The safety pin for the fire extinguisher had been allowed to come loose because the plastic security tie had broken and the fire extinguisher shifted within the package, activating the discharge lever.",NO COMMENT PROVIDED.,Yes,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,36,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,0,UPS,US,

The tank car emitted an odor and an audible hiss sound from the pressure plate connection at four bolts toward the A-end. No exposure or injury is reported. Tightening the pressure plate did stop the release . This car built up 205 psi in the afternoon heat which help to find this leak. There was one pressure plate nut, at the leak, which was two turns loose. The other three bolts, at the leak area, were one turn loose. Once tightened the leak stopped.  It was recommended to the shipper to review shop records to communicate this issue with last home-shop that had pressure plate off for root cause determination.    The shipper offered this tank car into transportation with the tank closures not completely tight. KCS emergency services were activated to provide for railroad safety qualified services to mitigate this emergency (e.g., special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, management oversight, train/yard crew delay).

Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

DIXIE HWY,LIMA,OH,45801,Carrier,"On July 15th Roeder Cartage traveled to Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, Ohio to  load Spent Sulfuric Acid ( ESP Drippings per Procter & Gamble ). This process has  been done and transported for the past 12 months with no incident. P & G  employees load the product accordingly to legal transport weight. The trailer is  sealed and verified secure by the driver, placard 1832.  In transit the driver routinely stops to check the trailer as verified by GPS tracking.  The last verified stop was approximately one hour and forty five minutes in  Okawville, Illinois prior to the release.  The shipment was traveling West on I-44 in Missouri approximately 60 miles west  of St. Louis on I-44 West bound en route San Diego, Ca. We presume that a  chemical reaction had started time and the trailer started to release built up  pressure in barreL This was from a reaction of the spent drippings. The trailer  pressure reliefvalve is set to relieve pressure at between 32 to 35 pounds. The air  gauge on the trailer was recording 38 pounds at the times of venting, or releases.  This difference in registered pressures is in the gauges as they are not precisely  exact. The pressure relief functioned exactly how it is designed operate. If it did not there was a good possibility that the trailer could have blown up causing massive  damages.  The truck was stopped by Sullivan, Missouri police after getting a report that a  tanker was releasing vapors and liquid. After stopping the truck/trailer the officer  approached in a wide path on the right side of the unit. At this time the pressure  was released and the officer was consumed in vapors. The Roeder Cartage driver  put on his respirator and pulled the officer from the vapors preventing more serious  injuries. He was transported to the local hospital where he was treated and released. Emergency responders were called and I-44 was closed in both the East and West lanes.  On Saturday July 16th the road was reopened at approximately 4:00 A.M. Central  time. The unit was first moved to a local access road with a parking area. This is  where the evacuation took place with a local motel nearby and additional  businesses. Later that morning the unit was moved to field in the town of Bourbon,  Missouri approximately six miles away. This is owned by the town and the fire  department. At this site the trailer was then connected to a series of scrubber  systems with totes of water. This was to relieve the pressure in the trailer and to cool the product. At this time the trailer was warm and the spent acid was guessed to be hot. There was still an ongoing chemical reaction going on inside the trailer as the pressure was not reducing. By Tuesday July 19th the pressure was subsiding and on Thursday July 21st the reaction and pressure was zero.  On Thursday Clean Harbors Response team along with Procter & Gamble response  employees initiated trying to pump off the spent into totes. That day two totes ere  filled before burning the pump","Procter & Gamble is doing an internal evaluation and investigation. They are doing  sampling and testing of the spent product. I am sure we or our insurance carrier,  Great West Casualty will be informed.  This particular barrel was a new stainless tank. This was the second spent load to be transported. The first also was P & G spent acid. There was no recordable residue  remaining in the barrel. The trailer was transported to Clean Harbors site in  Cincinnati, Ohio on their drop-deck trailer. The trailer was wrapped and secured  and inspected by the Missouri Department of Transportation before being moved.  Roeder Cartage does not plan on using this trailer again. We are not in confidence  of the integrity of the barrel. We consider this a Procter & Gamble issue and are  willing to scrap the trailer.  I am sure that Procter & Gamble will do everything in its ability to find a cause for this problem. I am sure that safeguards will be put in place before we transport  another load of spent acid for them.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,0,ROEDER CARTAGE INC,US,

The KCS responded to the release, along with Jay Hardy (Louisiana State Police, LSPD) and Demessia Hicks (Calumet). The cause of the release was found to be oringinating from a loose liquid line valve connection, where the Liquid valve bolts to the tank car four bolt flange.     Note: Item 27--Amount in package was estimated by report preparer because exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.     KCS emergency services were activated to provide for railroad safety qualified services to mitigate this emergency (e.g., special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, management oversight, train/yard crew delay, and regulatory notification reports).

Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

Responder's inspection revealed that the 3-inch liquid valve was leaking product at its threaded connection onto a threaded pipe nipple. The valve housing cover could not be secured with the current valve configuration. In order to secure the liquid valve on its threaded connection, the vacuum relief valve (VRV) was removed and a pipe plug was secured into the vacated VRV orifice. The liquid valve was tightened on its threaded connection. With the VRV removed and the liquid valve secured into its new position, the valve housing cover was able to be properly closed and sealed. Spillage on the side shell and around the valve housing area was wiped. No ground impact from spillage was reported.   The side specification stencil on MWSX 29624 indicated that the last tank qualification was completed in the year 2008.

The liner had a small tear in it, causing the material to stain the cardboard outer container.  No material leaked onto the ground.  The box was repackaged into a new one and all leaking paint cans were re-closed or repacked.  The shipment was then reloaded into a van trailer destined for the intended waste disposal facility.

The FRA Inspector also found the bottom outlet cap (BOC) not tool tight (hand tight only). Fresh product was evident around GATX 59718's manway closure with product on its side shell and safety appliances. Further inspection of GATX 59718's top fittings revealed 5 of 6 manway securement bolts less than tool tight (hand tight only) and the closure plug on the vapor valve was also less than tool tight (hand tight only). A BNSF contract responder was notified and requested to secure GATX 59718, as well as, clean all spillage from GATX 59718. GATX 59718 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard in order to accomplish the aforementioned tasks.  On 8/02/2011, contract responders cleaned the spillage from the tank shell and safety appliance of GATX 59718. Also, a small amount of hardened product atop the ground ballast at the previous location of GATX 59718 was scooped up and placed inside a small waste disposal receptacle. The manway closure was inspected and the manway gasket was found missing. A new 20 inch Salco Nitrile manway nozzle gasket was installed and the manway securement bolts properly tool tightened. The intact manway seal Suncor Energy-202679 was replaced by seal TIS-5999. The vapor valve closure plug was tool tightened. The valve housing cover was sealed with seal TIS-5930. The BOC was secured.

TAMMY HUFF,SAFETY DIRECTOR,,,,,Carrier,"Driver indicated that he was traveling North on Hwy. 111, a two lane road, when he met a pickup truck pulling a pontoon boat.  The pickup truck had drifted into the path of the tanker. The tanker driver tried to stop on the shoulder of the road and allow the pickup room to pass.  The shoulder of the road did not hold and the tanker started over as it was traveling around a curve in the road.  The tanker rolled two and one half times resting on the driver side of the truck/tanker. The tanker was punctured in two places and was spilling gasoline out of the bottom puncture and no product was coming out of the puncture on the passenger side as it was lying with that side up.  Product was also leaking out of the void holes between compartments 3 and 4.  Area fire department responded and contacted local personnel to help manage scene until clean up and company personnel could arrive on scene.  Dirt was pushed up against tanker to plug hole in the tanker on the bottom side.  A guage stick was broken and put in both the top and bottom void holes where product was leaking out.  A containment ditch was also dug in the event it was needed.  Lewis Transport personnel recovered all but 1702 gallons of the product that was on the overturned tanker.  The product that was released was cleaned up by GRAKAT, an environmental company that Lewis contracted to remediate the site.  The truck/tanker was uprighted and taken to R & R Racing facility in Flemingsburg, KY. Persons on site: Kentucky State Police, Kentucky EPA, Federal EPA, GRAKAT, Local Fire Department, R & R Racing (a towing company), Homeland Security Agent, Flemingsburg County EMS, Fleming County Emergency Services and Lewis Personnel.        Agencies contacted: NRC, KY EPA.",Our drivers maneuver tractor/tankers in tight situations on a daily basis.  Being on rural roadways making deliveries of petroleum products is stressful in itself. Lewis has always stressed the importance of speed and defensive driving when delivering product to rural communities.  Roadways leading to and from product delivery sites need to be maintained in a way to accommodate tractor/tanker combinations.

At 5:40 p.m., the SEFL driver came back to our dock complaining of a strong odor in his truck.  Upon opening the door, the smell was evident.  We unloaded all the pallets off the truck and noticed that a small puddle, about one gallon, had formed on the metal floor of the trailer.  One of our employees was instructed to don the appropriate PPE and another was asked to assemble the oildry and containers.  After outfitting in the proper PPE, the employee proceeded into the truck and absorbed the product through 2 applications of the absorbent and placed it in a 30-gallon salvage drum to be land-applied at a later date.  I walked the outside of the trailer several times and saw no evidence that the product had leaked outside of the bed of the truck.  The driver was satisfied with the clean up.  We placed the remaining product on a new pallet, reloaded the truck, and he proceeded on his route.  Best we can figure is there was a hairline crack in the jug and sometime during the loading or transport stage it was compromised.  The jug was in the bottom corner box on the pallet and cracked on the lower corner of the jug under the spout.  The pallet of material sat on our loading dock for approximately 3 hours awaiting pick up, and there was no evidence of leakage on our dock.",NO COMMENT PROVIDED,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CROP PRODUCTION SERVICES,US,

A BNSF Mechanical/Hazardous Material responder and a contract responder were dispatched to inspect and secure UTLX 644394. The responders reported finding the leak source at the 3 inch liquid valve's threaded connection on its threaded pipe nipple. The liquid valve was fully engaged/tool tight on its threaded connection but product was evident on the pipe nipple threads and at the pipe nipple base. Responders removed the liquid valve and observed that a section of the top 4-5 threads (portion that threads into the liquid valve) on the pipe nipple had sustained impact damage which prevented a good seal when the liquid valve was tightened onto its threads. The responder applied Teflon tape onto the liquid valves threaded connections and resecured the liquid valve onto the pipe nipple. UTLX 644394 was setout from the train and moved to another siding track.  No further product release was evident at the liquid valve connection while being monitored by the responders. Liquid spillage evaporated.

The FRA Inspector reported the possible vapor/odor source as NATX 300995's vacuum relief valve (VRV). A BNSF contract responder was notified and inspected NATX 300995 on 8/02/2011. The responder reported finding no product vapor/odor emanating from NATX 300995's VRV. Afterwards, NATX 300995 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard in order to conduct a more thorough inspection of all valves and fittings of NATX 300995.  On 8/03/2011, a detailed inspection of NATX 300995 revealed the threaded connection at the one inch vapor valve was the vapor/odor source. The vapor leak was at the threaded connection between the vapor valve and its pipe nipple. The vapor valve and the pipe nipple were removed and the orifice plugged. Inspection of the female valve threads and the male pipe nipple threads indicated some loss of thread or thread wear on both connecting thread surfaces. A new pipe nipple and one inch vapor valve were procured and installed. All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure. The valve housing was sealed with seal TIS-5933. Securement was completed by 1530 hrs. MDT, 8/03/2011. No liquid product released.  Shipper requested a FRA-OTMA to allow transportation to destination for unloading NATX 300995; and then to a qualified repair facility for deemed repairs and a leakproofness test.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3300,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Train movement was stopped and the area around UTLX 11223 was cordoned-off. The local F.D. placed catch receptacles to capture the escaping product; and later installed a magnetic patch over the hole in the compromised tank shell which ended the flow of product. The hole was towards the top of the side shell between center tank and tank head. A liner failure was suspected as the cause of this corrosion breach. Responders transferred the remaining product in UTLX 11223 into another suitable tank car that was placed on an adjacent track. Afterwards, the magnetic patch was removed and the area around the 5-6 inch longitudinal hole was cleaned. Another patch was affixed over the hole and sealant applied around its perimeter. Ground spillage was treated and neutralized with applications of lime. Two spillage impacted railcars entrained behind UTLX 11223 were decontaminated.   Two BNSF track maintenance employees working on an adjacent track in the railyard of UTLX 11223's inbound location, complained of inhalation exposure from product fumes emanating from UTLX 11223.

He noticed that tank car UTLX 130508 had vapor venting from the top of the car and thatthere was foul smell in the air. T he American Rail Dispatching Center emergency line was called to assist with allregulatory notifications. Fresno Fire Department responded to the scene and secured the area around the tank car.  SJVR managers Robert Jones and Robert Colvin responded to the scene as well and assisted emergency servicepersonnel with the paperwork and hazardous materials information. The customer that the railcar was destined forwas contacted to Inform them of the situation.The Fire Department mounted the tank car and inspected the origin of the venting vapor.  They found that there was an open tube with threads on the top of it that was open to the contents of the car. They capped the tube with aplastic bag to prevent any further vapors from venting.  A crew from the customer (Basic Chemical) arrived and performed an inspection on the railcar. They determined thatthe rupture valve assembly (Quick Inspection Safely Valve) was cracked from the base to the vent ports and the top of that holds a frangible disk and plug was completely missing.  The tube leading from the vent ports on the bottom ofthe assembly to the top was cracked as well.  They said that it looked like the metal bolts that secured the assemblyto tank car had been over tightened and that this had compromised the plastic assembly.The repair crew took a rupture valve assembly from another railcar in their facility and brought it to the location of theUTLX 130508 and replaced the valve.

SW,Calgary,NJ,,Carrier,"During a transfer of anhydrous ammonia at the EME Homer City plant, an o-ring contained in the rotating face of a mechanical seal assembly of the Blackmeer transfer pump cracked and allowed anhydrous ammonia to spew out of the pump.  The operator was standing near by and was able to shut down the pump and close the internal valve to prevent further release of product.  Approximately 10 litres released from the seal assembly.  A mechanical fact finding of the pump was performed and the failed component was determined to be the inner sealface o-ring of the mechanical seal assembly.  It had been replaced on 07/12/2011 at a Transport Canada (25-600) certified repair facility (ProPar(1978) in Aylmer, ON.  Closer examination of the o-ring revealed that a cut had compromised the mechanical seal and led to the release.  The cause of the failure could not be determined with complete certainty.  Either the o-ring was cut originally prior to the install or it was kinked when it was installed on 07/12/2011. Three full deliveries with the pump were executed prior to this incident without failure.  As a result we believe the root cause to be human error during the installation process.","Further to the investigation we have asked the repair facility to use special care when fitting the mechanical seals over the threaded shafts of the LPG pumps. Prior to installation the mechanical seal is lubricated with a special compound and all o-rings are examined for defects.  The process involves carefully sliding it over the shaft while taking care to not cut, kink or tear the inner o-ring.  Once installed it is impossible to see the inner ring.  Only during the test and use phase can it be measured.  No further action will result from this isolated incident.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,ZZ,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,TRIMAC TRANSPORTATION SERVICES,US,

BRENT THEN WALKED AROUND THE PUMP AND HOSES TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE NO LEAKS, AND WHEN NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED GOT BACK IN THE TRUCK. BRENT THEN INCREASED THE RPM OF THE MOTOR FROM INSIDE THE TRUCK, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ENGINE RACED TO ""MAYBE 5000 RPM"", SO BRENT TURNED OFF THE IGNITION, THEN GASOLINE STARTED COMING DOWN FROM THE PIPE ABOVE THE TRUCK, THE ENGINE THEN BLEW FROM THE EXCESSIVE RPM AND THE GASOLINE STARTED ON FIRE AROUND THE TRUCK. A PERSON WATCHING THE INCIDENT SAID THAT BRENT CLIMBED FROM THE TRUCK AND COLLAPSED, THE FIRE ENGULFED THE CAB OF THE TRUCK. IT WASN'T UNTIL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SHOWED UP AND STARTED SPRAYING THE CAB FIRE WITH WATER THAT THE FIRE SPREAD TO THE TRAILER AND STARTED THE TRAILER ON FIRE.","THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE IS CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED BY AN OUTSIDE INVESITGATOR, ALONG WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY FOR BLAKESBURG OIL.

AS DRIVER BOB ZIESMER APPROACHED THE TANK TO WHERE THE FUEL WAS TO BE UNLOADED HE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A LARGE, STANDING WATER POOL BLOCKING DIRECT ACCESS TO THE TANK. MR. ZIESMER HAD MADE THIS DELIVERY MANY TIMES PREVIOUSLY AND KNEW FROM PAST EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN THAT AREA GETS WET THAT THERE IS A GOOD LIKELIHOOD THAT THE TRUCK WILL GET STUCK IN THE SOFT, WET MATERIAL. OTHER DRIVERS HAD GOTTEN STUCK IN THE SAME AREA PREVIOUSLY AND HAD TO BE PULLED OUT WITH EQUIPMENT FROM MIDWEST ENERGY. TO ACCESS THE TANK AREA, MR. ZIESMER HAD TO PULL AROUND THE LARGE, WET AREA OF STANDING WATER AND IN HIS MANEUVER TOWARD THE TANK ENDED UP BACKING HIS TANKER INTO THE EQUIPMENT BAY. AS MR. ZIESMER PULLED OUT OF THE BAY, HE HAD TO TURN THE TRACTOR IN ORDER TO MANEUVER TOWARD THE TANK. UNFORTUNATELY, MR. ZIESMER TURNED TOO QUICKLY OR SHARPLY AND AS HE PULLED FURTHER OUT OF THE BAY, THE TANKER COMPARTMENT WAS RIPPED OPEN ABOUT MIDWAY UP BY A VERTICAL STEEL POST THAT ACTED AS AN OVERHEAD DOOR BUMPER. APPROXIMATELY 700 GALLONS OF THE COMPARTMENT CONTENTS OF DIESEL FUEL ESCAPED. FORTUNATELY, THE MAJORITY OF THE FUEL RAN BACK INTO THE CONCRETE LINED EQUIPMENT BY FROM WHICH MR. ZIESMER WAS EXITING FROM AND WAS CONTAINED. A SMALL AMOUNT RAN FORWARD AND INTO THE AREA MADE UP OF DIRT AND COAL. MR. ZIESMER INITIATED CLEANUP OF THE SPILL AND NOTIFIED PERSONNEL AT MIDWEST ENERGY AND HE ALSO INITIATED OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN.    EDWARDS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTORS WERE CONTACTED AND DISPATCHED AT APPROXIMATELY 4AM BY EDWARDS OILS GENERAL MANAGER MR. BOB SKALKO. MR.

IN ADDITION, EDWARDS DISPATCHED ANOTHER COMPANY TRUCK WITH ADDITIONAL CLEANUP MATERIALS AND LABOR TO HELP OUT IN THE CLEANUP PROCESS AND REMOVE THE REMAINING CONTENTS OF THE TRAILER COMPARTMENT. EDWARDS ALSO NOTIFIED WISCONSIN DNR AND THE FEDERAL NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.     THE MAJORITY OF THE EMERGENCY RECOVERY OF THE FREE PRODUCT AND SLURRY MIX WAS DONE BY 10AM AND ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO REMOVE BETWEEN 10-20 YARDS OF A DIRT/COAL MIX THAT THE DIESEL HAD DRAINED INTO BUT WAS TOO DEEP OR DRY TO BE RECOVERED BY A VACUUM TRUCK. A SMALL BACKHOE WAS COMMISSIONED TO EXCAVATE THIS AREA AND MR. JOE PALO WAS ON-HAND TO SUPERVISE THE CLEANUP. MIDWEST ENERGY RETAINED ENVIRONMENTAL TROUBLESHOOTERS TO SUPERVISE MR.

The path of the ethanol ran down the sides of the railcar to the ground.  The spill left a 4-foot wide visible path down the sides of the tank car.  The drip pan under the rail car caught a majority of the ethanol, but it overflowed and product impacted the soil.  The total square footage of impacted soil was approximately 8 feet.  The estimated amount of ethanol that impacted the soil is 20 gallons.  The RQ for ethanof is 15 gallons. The block valve on the line connecting to the product hose was closed immediately, stopping the product from continuing to fill the rail car.  Agency notifications were made, NRC Incident # 928484 assigned.  The impacted rock and soil were remediated and placed into a labeled satellite drum.  The block valve that connects to the block valve was then locked out.  The tank car, NATX-364454, was hooked up for off-load into Tank 95-2, along with 11 other ethanol cars all sharing the same common line.  The check valve, located behind the block valve at spot 5B where the car was hooked up, didn't hold. Investigation revealed that a small rock, likely inside the rail car or capped unloading hose, entered the system and wedged against a check valve, forcing it to remain open.  When the operator began opening the block valves for each ethanol car, product began to flow in the opposite direction due to the path of least resistance.  The tank was closed at this point and the ethanol lines remained full until remediation was completed and Supervisor deemed situation safe to continue.",ROOT CAUSE: ROCK ENTERED SYSTEM AND JAMMED CHECK VALVE OPEN.  CORRECTIVE ACTION PERFORMED:                                                                         1. REMEDIATE ALL IMPACTED SOIL INTO DRUM.  2.

Driver immediately pulled over when safe to do so and took immediate action with his on board spill kit. Driver notified his dispatcher who in turn notified a representative from our Loss Prevention Department who contacted one of our Emergency Spill Responders (ER)to mitigate the unintention release at the scene. The local police and fire departments responded as well to help mitigate and contain the spill. There were 6 plastic IBCs in metal cages on board the trailer along with other miscellaneous freight. Apparently the blocking and bracing of the IBCs failed and as a result a pallet that was being used as dunnage inbetween two of the totes punctured one of the IBCs about midpoint. The piece of wood that punctured the IBC actually worked as a plug as well preventing mass evacuation of the IBC where it was punctured. The ER was able to pump the remaining fluid into four poly overpack containers and the material that had spilled out was neutralized and cleaned with absorbents and actually removal/replacement of contaminated soil as well.,When blocking and bracing need to properly place dunnage being used to prevent these types of unintentional releases from occurring. Will use this example in future training meetings to prevent future unintentional releases.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,11751,A.
