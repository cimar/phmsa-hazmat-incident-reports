The trailer was taken to the Butler Transfer facility in Kansas City, Kansas that same day by Heritage Transport.  On April 6, 2015 Heritage Transport driver arrived at Butler Transfer facility in Kansas City, Kansas to pick up the van to deliver it to its final destination.  Upon arrival, the driver noticed material leaking from the trailer.  He immediately notified an emergency coordinator at the Heritage Environmental Services, Kansas City, Missouri office, who gathered supplies and mobilized to the transfer station in Kansas City, Kansas.  A 55-gallon metal drum had a small hole on the side and was leaking slowly.  It appears that the forks of a fork-truck poked a hole in the side of the container, probably during the trailer loading process on April 2, 2015.  Floor dry was used to absorb the spilled material on the floor of the trailer and on the asphalt beneath the trailer.  Spill clean-up material was containerized and will be properly disposed of.  The leaking container was overpacked.  The lowest reportable quantity of the material was 10 pounds and the estimated loss of material was approximately 10 pounds.

Loaded in ULD number AKE91670TG. Upon breakdown of the container at about 0630am, 12 April, at the Thai Cargo warehouse, 1 box of the above shipment was found tipped on its side and apparently leaking (box appeared wet and ""crushed""). Damaged box was removed and loaded upright(it stopped leaking), separated from the other cargo in the warehouse DGR area. Four boxes from three other shipments were wet from the leaking box. warehouse staff cleaned up the spill but two boxes(paper wrapped and cardboard) were wet from the battery acid.  All the affected customers were informed of the leaked material (battery acid). Only one customer rejected their package (magazines).  The damaged DGR box was not braced within the container to prevent tipping (all DGR boxes had orientation arrow markings). The box appeared to be crushed on one end but this may have been as a result of the fiberboard being soaked and deformed by the weight of the battery.  I called FAA Special Agent, Security and Hazardous Material Safety, Karen Yoneda, on 13April who came to the warehouse to inspect the damaged box.  The battery was unpacked from the outer 4G box and inner ""retial"" fiberboard box.  There were no apparent signs of damage(cracks, holes,separation) to the battery. The top of the battery was still wet around the filler caps. The acid level was about 1.5 inches below the ""low fluid"" level mark on the battery(there was still acid in all the cells).","All DGR boxes must be loaded to prevent shifting or tipping during ground and air transport.

File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.

Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources was advised of the release.

This resulted in the tractor and trailer slowly rolling over onto its right side.     The ditch was diked with sand bags and absorbent booms because the rear washout wash out cap gasket was leaking. Approximately 5 gallons of material was captured in a bucket. An additional 5 gallons of material spilled during the installation and use of a BETTS VALVE that was placed over the wash out cap to facilitate offloading of content.    Approximately 1 to 2 inches of impacted soil was removed and properly disposed of by OMI Environmental Solutions. The duration of the event from start of incident to completion of response effort was 10 hours.,"The root cause of the incident was driver error. A contributing factor involved the standing rain water that obstructed the drivers view of the ditch bank and associated slippery conditions.

After loading, he proceeded down Highway 87 toward the intended destination in Houston, TX.  Within 1.5 miles of the loading facility, the driver braked for a stop sign and the product ""sloshed"" inside the trailer, exiting washout ports on the top of the trailer and spilling on to the street in the intersection.  The driver pulled the truck and trailer into an adjacent parking lot and notified appropriate authorities.  The Nixon Fire Department and Police Department responded and shut down the intersection as vehicles had driven through the spill and tracked the product along the roadway.  The Nixon Fire Department also notified the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (which did not respond as the material did not enter a storm drain or waterway and was contained on the roadway.)  The Sun Coast Resources internal spill team responded to the scene and placed absorbent material on the roadway to clean up the spill.  A street sweeper was used to cleanup the material which will be recycled as appropriate through a third party vendor.  It was determined upon investigation that the washout ports on the top of the trailer had not been properly secured after a recent servicing by a third party vendor.",Sun Coast has established a new procedure for reviewing trailers and trucks after they are returned from servicing by third party vendors.  The vendor in this case has been put on notice that they are to secure any washout port covers prior to releasing the equipment back to Sun Coast.  Sun Coast staff will now carefully inspect the equipment after it is returned from the vendor to ensure it has been properly secured prior to returning the equipment back into service.

Arrived at location and checked gauge. Fuel was not visible on manual site glass. Order was for 3000 gallons and the tank was 5000 gallon tank. Electronic gauge was at 1272 gallons. Followed railroad procedures for filling tanks. Stepped away from nozzle to get ready to change pockets on fuel truck. Locomotive electronic tank gauge stated 2400 gallons and manual site glass was almost unreadable but did not see fuel in the site glass. Read locomotive electronic gauge again and it was at 3650 gallons. At this time driver looked back at fuel connections and he saw fuel coming out of the vent. Immediately stopped the flow and pump and started containment.,Spill containment was completed by LTI driver and other LTI personnel. Vacuum truck from Lube Tech recyclers dispatched to removed most of the product. An outside spill remediation company dispatched to perform final cleanup and soil recycling.

The driver was operating a one-ton Chevrolet pickup towing a gooseneck flatbed trailer.  At the moment the vehicles were 5 miles south of Crane, Texas. At approximately 2:30 pm (1430 hours). The driver stated he heard a loud sound and felt the trailer not pulling as it normally should based on his experience.  The driver stated he looked in his right outside rear view mirror and noticed what appeared to be a tire disintegrating and coming apart.  The driver immediately pulled over to the right off the roadway and came to a stop.  The driver exited his vehicle and proceeded towards the right side of the trailer towards the axles. The driver stated that before reached the tire, he immediately noticed smoke coming from the tire and axles area.  He wasn't sure of the specific source of the smoke.  The driver immediately returned to the truck, obtained the required fire extinguisher and returned to the axle area.  As he did the driver stated that a fire had already started and he attempted to extinguish the flames.  He was unable to extinguish the flames.  The motorist of a passing vehicle stopped and also assisted in attempting to extinguish the flames also.  It was at this time the driver contacted Crane County 911 Services. The assisting motorist was also unsuccessful.  By this time the flames had grown and began to engulf the IBC's that contained the flammable liquids.  The IBC's were UN 31HA1 composites with a metal outer steel body with a rigid plastic inner receptacle.  The IBC's each had a 330 gallon capacity and there was a total of four (4). There were also a total of twelve (12) 5-gallon pails. The flames began to melt the plastic therefore compromising the integrity of the packages. The driver stated the trailer was completely engulfed in  flames and as the IBC's were be melted, flammable liquid product began spilling off the trailer deck and onto the ground.  The driver stated he was unable to disconnect the truck from the trailer due to the proximity of the flames and the risk of personal injury. The product that was releasing onto the ground also ignited and damaged a pipe fence. There were not any creeks, streams, river or any other bodies of water within the vicinity.  Being that the driver had no further means to extinguish the fire he began the process of stopping oncoming traffic from both directions in attempt to prevent harm to others. The driver was located on the south side of the vehicles when the first law enforcement unit arrived.  During this time the Crane Fire Department arrived on the scene from the north.  Afterwards fire department and law enforcement stated the driver did an exceptional job at controlling the scene, directing traffic and protecting others.  Arriving on the scene as WadeCo representatives were Brandon Blau and Kyle Johnson.  Also eventually arriving on the sc",The incident was discussed in detail with all drivers and warehouse personnel during the safety meeting within 2 weeks afterwards.  The need to ensure all IBC's are in good condition and within the 2.5 year test and re-test requirements.  To ensure that all IBC's and other authorized packages are free of residue on the outside of the packages.  Drivers are to continue to inspect their vehicle tires as part of the pre-trip process and each time before starting a new hazmat transport.  A review was being conducted to determine if there had been similar incidents of tire failure with the same brand or tire to establish if a pattern was occurring.,Yes,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,156802,"guardian ctc, llc",US,

The driver was operating a one-ton Chevrolet pickup towing a gooseneck flatbed trailer.  At the moment the vehicles were 5 miles south of Crane, Texas. At approximately 2:30 pm (1430 hours). The driver stated he heard a loud sound and felt the trailer not pulling as it normally should based on his experience.  The driver stated he looked in his right outside rear view mirror and noticed what appeared to be a tire disintegrating and coming apart.  The driver immediately pulled over to the right off the roadway and came to a stop.  The driver exited his vehicle and proceeded towards the right side of the trailer towards the axles. The driver stated that before reached the tire, he immediately noticed smoke coming from the tire and axles area.  He wasn't sure of the specific source of the smoke.  The driver immediately returned to the truck, obtained the required fire extinguisher and returned to the axle area.  As he did the driver stated that a fire had already started and he attempted to extinguish the flames.  He was unable to extinguish the flames.  The motorist of a passing vehicle stopped and also assisted in attempting to extinguish the flames also.  It was at this time the driver contacted Crane County 911 Services. The assisting motorist was also unsuccessful.  By this time the flames had grown and began to engulf the IBC's that contained the flammable liquids.  The IBC's were UN 31HA1 composites with a metal outer steel body with a rigid plastic inner receptacle.  The IBC's each had a 330 gallon capacity and there was a total of four (4). There were also a total of twelve (12) 5-gallon pails. The flames began to melt the plastic therefore compromising the integrity of the packages. The driver stated the trailer was completely engulfed in  flames and as the IBC's were be melted, flammable liquid product began spilling off the trailer deck and onto the ground.  The driver stated he was unable to disconnect the truck from the trailer due to the proximity of the flames and the risk of personal injury. The product that was releasing onto the ground also ignited and damaged a pipe fence. There were not any creeks, streams, river or any other bodies of water within the vicinity.  Being that the driver had no further means to extinguish the fire he began the process of stopping oncoming traffic from both directions in attempt to prevent harm to others. The driver was located on the south side of the vehicles when the first law enforcement unit arrived.  During this time the Crane Fire Department arrived on the scene from the north.  Afterwards fire department and law enforcement stated the driver did an exceptional job at controlling the scene, directing traffic and protecting others.  Arriving on the scene as WadeCo representatives were Brandon Blau and Kyle Johnson.  Also eventually arriving on the sc",The incident was discussed in detail with all drivers and warehouse personnel during the safety meeting within 2 weeks afterwards.  The need to ensure all IBC's are in good condition and within the 2.5 year test and re-test requirements.  To ensure that all IBC's and other authorized packages are free of residue on the outside of the packages.  Drivers are to continue to inspect their vehicle tires as part of the pre-trip process and each time before starting a new hazmat transport.  A review was being conducted to determine if there had been similar incidents of tire failure with the same brand or tire to establish if a pattern was occurring.,Yes,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,156802,"guardian ctc, llc",US,

The employee was measuring the fill using the gauge on the end of the tank, the employee got distracted for a while, and then realized he had filled it to 90%. The employee immediately shut off the truck and detached the hose. The employee checked all the valves and gauges and everything looked ok. The employee advised his supervisor of what had happened. About 20 minutes later the customer called and stated that there was propane coming out one of the relief valves. The valve was functioning properly. The customer began pumping down their tank.

He tightened the valve, cleaned up the leak and the leak appeared to have stopped.  Upon arrival at the intermediate truck transfer facility it was felt that the valve may still be leaking after looking at the spill pad.  A response crew was summoned, donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and transfered the material into a new tote.  The state of Oklahoma was notified--incident number 141264.

THE RELEASED PRODUCT RAN FROM THE PRESSURE SIDE OF COMPOSITES ONE OWNED PUMP DOWN TO A CATCH BASIN WHICH DRAINED INTO A PRIVATELY OWNED RETENTION AREA NORTH OF THE BUILDING. THE LEAK OCCURRED WHEN THE CARGO TANK WAS 3/4 EMPTY. BRIAN KOHRT (COMPOSITES ONE EMPLOYEE) WAS UNLOADING THE CARGO TANK WHEN HE NOTICED THE HOSE CONNECTION LEAKING.  HE SHUT THE PUMP DOWN, CLOSED ALL VALVES, DETERMINED THE PROBLEM.  HE IMMEDIATELY WENT TO CHECK THE DRAIN CLOSURE, OBSERVED IT WAS OPEN, AND SHUT IT.  NOTICING THE RESIN HAD MADE IT TO THE PRIVATELY OWNED RETENTION AREA, HE ADVISED HIS SUPERVISOR'S, TAMBI JONES.  SPILL CONTAINMENT AND CLEANUP WAS ONGOING BY COMPANY EMPLOYEES.  NANCY DEHMLOW (VP) CALLED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (202-267-2675) TO REPORT THE INCIDENT (NRC#1114162).  CALLS WERE ALSO MADE TO THE INDIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMNET (IDEM), OUR CONTACT WAS RICH HACKEL FORM IDEM (REPORT #54144) WHO ARRIVED ON SITE ABOUT AN HOUR LATER WITH GABE CAMERON FROM ELKHART COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT GROUNDWATER PROGRAM SUPERVISOR.  WHILE WE REVIEWED THE SITUATION WITH THEM, NANCY DEHMLOW LOCATED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SERVICES, INC (ERS) OUT OF FT. WAYNE, IN. RICH HACKEL WAS FAMILIAR WITH THIS COMPANY AND APPROVING OF ERS TO REMEDIATE THE SITUATION. KYLE TURNER OF ERS ARRIVED 2 HOURS LATER AND DISCUSSED WITH RICH HACKEL WHAT WAS NEEDED TO REMEDIATE THE SITUATION.  THE PLAN WAS TO EXCAVATE THE SOIL, PLACE IN ROLL AWAY DUMPSTERS FOR DISPOSAL AND TEST REMAINING SOIL TO CONFIRM COMPLETE REMEDIATION WAS ACHIEVED. WE RECEIVED CONFIRMATION THE WEEK OF MAY 11 THAT THE SOIL TEST WAS CLEAN. CATCH BASIN AND DRAIN PIPES WERE ALSO CLEANED.    FINDINGS:  ROOT CAUSE:  A TWO INCH CAM LOCK FITTING GASKET MADE OF NITRILE/WHITE ON THE DISCHARGE SIDE (PRESSURE SIDE) FAILED ALLOWING THE PRODUCT TO FLOW FROM THE CAM LOCK FITTING CONNECTION.  NITRILE IS NOT THE RIGHT ELASTOMER FOR THIS PRODUCT. STYRENE LIKE PRODUCTS WILL CAUSE NITRILE TO SHRINK AND GET BRITTLE. VITON B FLUOROELASTOMER (FKM) IS THE PROPER GASKET MATERIAL.  THE PUMP OFF AREA HAD AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF BOTH NITRILE (WHITE GASKETS) AND VITON B FLUOROELASTOMER (FKM). IN TALKING WITH DOUG HE FELT THE SUPPLIER MAY HAVE SHIPPED THE WRONG GASKETS (NITRILE) AT SOME POINT. CORRECTIVE ACTION: DOUG AND BRIAN WILL REMOVE ALL NITRILE GASKETS AND DISPOSE OF THEM ASSURING ONLY VITON GASKETS ARE USED GOING FORWARD. BRIAN WILL CHANGE OUT ALL HOSE GASKETS WEEKLY WITH NEW VITON GASKETS OR SOONER IF NEEDED.","1. THE CATCH BASIN (DRAIN) IN THE NEXT DOCK NORTH WHERE THE SPILLED PRODUCT MIGRATED TO WAS NOT SECURED.

THE MARKING ON THE CONTAINER INDICATED THAT IT WAS ""EMPTY"" BUT NOT CLEANED.  THE CONTAINER WAS BEING PREPPED FOR CLEANING AND FLUSHING OF ANY RESIDUAL PRODUCT THAT MAY BE AS A RESULT OF PICKLING OF THE STEEL BY THE CHLORINE. THE EMPLOYEE HAD FILLED THE CONTAINER WITH WATER 24 HOURS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. THE EMPLOYEE THAT WAS WORKING ON THE UNIT WAS REMOVING A REAR SAFETY TO INSTALL A DRAIN LINE TO FLUSH THE WATER OUT OF THE UNIT. THE EMPLOYEE INDICATED THAT HE TESTED THE CONTAINER FOR PRESSURE/VACUUM. HE INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A VACUUM DETECTED. USING AN IMPACT WRENCH HE ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE REAR SAFETY. THE IMPACT WRENCH RELEASED THE SAFETY TO QUICKLY NOT ALLOWING HIM TO CHECK FOR ANY PRESSURE PRIOR TO REMOVING THE SAFETY. THE SAFETY WITH THE HELP OF THE PRESSURE AND THE IMPACT WRENCH RELEASED EXTREMELY QUICK, PREVENTING THE EMPLOYEE FROM RECOGNIZING THAT THE CONTAINER HAD PRESSURE.

THE CONTAINER AT THAT POINT WAS EMPTY FOR ANY RESIDUAL AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.","ACTIONS THAT WILL BE TAKEN ARE TO IMPROVE THE PROCEDURES THAT OUTLINE THE PROPER METHOD TO TEST FOR PRESSURE/VACUUM.  THE PROCEDURE WILL BE IMPROVED AS FOLLOW:  1. ANY CONTAINER THAT IS INDICATED TO HAVE A ""VACUUM"" WILL BE TESTED FOR BOTH A VACUUM AS WELL AS FOR PRESSURE. A VACUUM TEST GAUGE WILL BE UTILIZED TO TEST FOR A VACUUM. THE SERIAL NUMBER OF THE UNIT WILL BE RECORDED WITH THE RESULTS OF THE TEST. WHETHER OR NOT A VACUUM IS DETECTED THE PRESSURE GAUGE WILL BE UTILIZED TO DETECT ANY PRESSURE. THIS WILL BE A DOUBLE INDICATION THAT THE VESSEL HAS NO PRESSURE AND THE VESSEL IN FACT HAS A VACUUM. THE PRESSURE WILL BE RECORDED AS INDICATED. IF THE UNIT HAS NO INDICATIONS OF A VACUUM OR PRESSURE THEN THE CUSTOMER WILL BE CONTACTED TO PICK UP THE CONTAINER AND HAVE IT RETURNED FOR A COMPLETE A PROPER VACUUM. IF THE CONTAINER HAS A POSITIVE INDICATION OF PRESSURE THEN IT WILL BE LABELED TO BE RETURNED TO THE CUSTOMER FOR PROPER EVACUATION.  2. IF ANY EMPLOYEE SUSPECTS THAT THE CONTAINER DOES NOT HAVE A PROPER AND COMPLETE VACUUM, E.G. AN ORDER FROM SLIGHT LEAK DUE TO A VALVE NOT BEING COMPLETELY SHUT, THEY ARE TO REJECT THE CONTAINER AS PER CGA C 6.0, AS IF IT WERE ANY OTHER CYLINDER TO BE PROCESSED. ITEM NUMBER ""ONE"" WILL BE PREFORMED IMMEDIATELY. THE OUTLINE WILL BE FOLLOWED FOR TESTING FOR VACUUM AND/OR PRESSURE.  3. THE METHOD OF REMOVAL OF ANY PLUG/SAFETY IN ORDER TO INSTALL A DRAIN WILL BE DONE WITH A HAND TOOL, E.G. A BREAKER BAR AND SOCKET ASSEMBLY, SO THAT THE OPERATOR CAN USE HIS SENSES MORE EFFECTIVELY.

IT HAD RECEIVED ITS ANNUAL TANK INSPECTION AND DOT INSPECTIONS/REPAIRS.  THE TRUCK WAS TAKEN TO THE REFINERY AND THEN TO THE BARGE TO GO TO ORCAS ISLAND.  THE TRUCK WAS THEN DRIVEN TO THE ""SAFE HOUSE"" YARD FOR STORAGE.  THE DRIVER DETACHED THE GLAD HANDS FROM THE TRAILER AND RAISED THE DRAW BAR.  THERE WAS NO MOVEMENT ONCE HITCH WAS CLEARED.  THIS INDICATES BRAKES ARE SET.  SAFETY CHAINS WERE REMOVED.  THE DRIVER GOT UP TO GET THE CHALKS STORED ON THE TRACTOR PORTION.  SECONDS LATER THE TRAILER STARTED TO ROLL BACK.  IT CONTINUED TO ROLL DOWN A SMALL BACK (6 TO 8 FEET).  AT THE BOTTOM THE TRAILER ROLLED 3/4 AROUND AND CAME TO REST ON ITS SIDE.  THE DRIVER CALLED 911.  FUEL STARTED TO LEAK OUT OF ONE OF THE VENT PORTS ON THE TOP (ABOUT A QUART A MINUTE OR LESS).  NO LEAKS FROM THE TANK STRUCTURE.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID NOT ALLOW MY DRIVER TO GET NEAR THE VEHICLE TO PUT PUTTY IN THE VENT TO STOP THE LEAK.  FROM THIS POINT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID NOT ALLOW US TO STOP THE LEAK EVEN THOUGH WE HAD THE MEANS TO.  WE COULD HAVE STOPPED THE LEAK WITH A POTENTIAL OF ONLY HAVING SPILLED 5 TO 10 GALLONS.  THE ROLL OVER OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 2:30.  NRC WAS CALLED AND THEY ARRIVED ONSITE AT 9:30 (IT'S HARD TO GET TO AN ISLAND).  THE LEAK WAS STOPPED BY THEM IN THE SAME MANNER AS WAS DESCRIBED BY OUR COMPANY 7 HOURS PRIOR.  NRC DRILLED HOLES IN THE SIDE OF THE TANK AND REMOVED ALL BUT 280 GALLONS PICKED UP AT REFINERY.  THAT IS HOW WE KNOW MUCH FUEL WAS LEAKED.  THE FUEL WAS TRANSFERRED TO DONOR TRUCK.  THE EFFECTED EARTH WAS DUG UP AND STORED IN A PLASTIC TARPED AREA AND COVERED UNTIL THE SOIL WAS SHIPPED OFFSITE AND TREATED.","OWNER OF ISLAND PETROLEUM SERVICES ORDERED AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTION OF THE TRAILER. THE FAILURE OCCURRED WITH THE CHECK VALVE LEADING TO A RESERVE TANK ON TRAILER. THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT 10 SECONDS FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF THE GLAD HANDS.  THIS PHENOMENON WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AND FILMED. THE FLOOD OF AIR RELEASED THE BRAKES. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THIS CHECK VALVE IS NOT PART OF A ROUTINE DOT INSPECTION. OUR NEW COMPANY POLICY IS TO REPLACE THE CHECK VALVE EVERY FIVE YEARS REGARDLESS OF PERFORMANCE. I HAVE SHARED THIS ADVICE WITH MY LOCAL COMPETITORS WHO HAVE SIMILAR TRUCKS. WE ARE IN A SALT WATER ENVIRONMENT SO PARTS CAN FAIL FASTER THAN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.    THE ""SAFE HOUSE"" SITE WILL HAVE ECOLOGY BLOCKS PLACED AT THE TOP OF THE EMBANKMENT. THE GRADE WAS RECENTLY REDONE AND IT APPEARS FLAT BUT THE GRADE IS MISLEADING AS IT DOES PITCH TOWARD THE EMBANKMENT. THE CONCRETE BARRIER WILL PREVENT ANY ROLLING VEHICLE OR MISJUDGED DISTANCES WHEN BACKING A VEHICLE.    IT IS ALSO COMPANY POLICY TO CHALK WHEELS NO MATTER WHERE THE VEHICLE RESTS.
