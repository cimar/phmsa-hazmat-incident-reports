The driver then contacted his home dispatcher and a mechanic from the facility inspected the manway and found that the vacuum relief valve had possibly stuck in the open position causing the small leak. The mechanic suggested the pop was from the valve closing from the open position. Local response team donning the proper personal protective equipment cleaned up the site of leaked material from the tanker. The valve was deemed closed by the mechanic an no other failure could be identified. The tanker was returned to the Clean Harbors plant of loads origin in Braintree MA for offload onto another tanker for continued transportation to intended disposal facility. The tanker was put out of service, cleaned and sent back to the Clean Harbors maintenance facility in Weymouth for inspection and repair. The Mass DEP was notified of the spill and did not respond to spill site Report #4-23923","At the time the tanker was loaded for transportation, no evidence of leaking or damage was observed.

When the first responders arrived they found an active leak coming drom the dome lid of the trailer.The dome lid was not cracked but the seal had been compromised. They set up an evcuation zone and decided to let the leak continue until the private cleanup company developed an accetable plan to stop the leak and off load the product. This planned was approved by the on scene commander and the work to stop the leak began at approximately 2pm.The remaining product was off loaded into anothe trailer. This was completed at approximately 2am on 5-3-12.Sun Coast Resources as contracted by our company for clean up and mitigation of the spill site.

Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

UTLX 130325 was cordoned off in the railyard awaiting inspection by contract responders. Responders reported that inspection of UTLX 130325 revealed vapor escaping at the vapor valve's bolted flange connection.  One flange bolt stud nut was missing and the remaining three flange bolt nuts were not tool tight (hand tight only). The responders replaced the missing nut and properly tool tightened all the flange nuts on the stud bolts. Afterwards, this flange connection was monitored and no further vapor release was observed. The area around the vapor valve was neutralized with an alkaline solution until a neutral pH was achieved. No ground impact was evident.

Two employees began removing freight from trailer.  An odor was noticed.  Another employee, trained in hazardous material waste disposal investigated trailer.  This employee closed the trailer door and notified the terminal manager.  The terminal manager identified, using ERG, that the building would need to be evacuated.      9-1-1 was contacted at approximately 09:50 regarding the potential release of phenyl mercaptan due to the strong odor in the trailer.  Police, fire (hazmat team & EMTs) responded.  The three exposed employees that entered the trailer were taken to the hospital for evaluation and possible decontamination.    McGrath Road was closed and Commerce Drive was open only to local traffic.  Route 113 was unaffected and remained open through incident mitigation.  Personnel on scene believe that nearby businesses were told to shelter in place.    Con-way field safety personnel as well as the emergency response coordinating team at the corporate office were contacted by terminal manager.    An emergency response coordinator contacted ERTS for mitigation assistance.  The contractor reported an 1-hour ETA.      MADEP contacted.  Case No. pending  NRC contacted.  Case No. 1012262  Dracut LEPC contacted. No Case No. provided    The hazmat team (fire) entered the building to verify the release of material.  They were not able to confirm with the equipment available.  They entered the trailer between (time uncertain) 12:00 and 13:00.  A sample of a white powder on the trailer floor was taken.  Fire department not releasing scene to contractor until onsite identification of material made.    White powder identified as talcum powder and fumaric acid (food preservative).  These are not related to the incident and the source of the powder is unknown.    Fire department released the scene to contractor and roads re-opened between 14:00-14:05.      Contractor identified a compromised carton containing phenyl mercaptan.  This was identified by the odor and upon inspection of the box. The tape sealing the box is discolored which shows that the vapors from the phenyl mercaptin reacted with the adhesive on the tape which caused the discoloration. It appears that it is an internal packaging failure such as a broken seal or cap which caused the release of vapors from the internal package. Carton not opened for confirmation.  Unknown inner packaging type and exact quantity.  No liquid was released from outer packaging.     Contractor contained all hazardous materials shipments and white powder that had been on trailer.  The other shipment involved was PRO#454-262222 which contained chromium trioxide and sodium dichromate.  This shipment was contained at the request of MADEP and EPA.

The following day, May 26, 2012 the car was checked to verify it was maintaining proper pressure, a small leak from the PRV was noticed at that time.

This was a misleading MSDS and may have contributed to the the shipper offering it as a nonhaz (and thus sending undeclared or hidden DG).

After the Veolia employees located the leaking drum, they determined the cause of the leak to be two pin hole leaks near the middle of the drum (half way up)at the chime.

The transfer was required because of a defective draft gear pocket discovered on PROX 13636 during routine inspection at Port Arthur. At the end of the transfer, compressed air was allowed to flow from PROX 13636 and exit submerged liquid line in the loaded tank car ACFX 95168 causing lading to roll excessively and splash out of the open manway cover. No injuries or exposures occurred.     After PROX 13636 was transferred, it was loaded onto a flatcar for further transportation to home shop for repair under one-time movement approval.

After loading and during transit, the tank started venting through the pressure relief valve. It believed this was due to product agitation during the loading process and the high outside temperature. This was as per design to relieve pressure build-up. It is believed that there was a slight ice build-up in the valve seat, due to the temperature differential of the product and the outside air, which prevented the valve from closing entirely.

Wet pavement affected tire traction and driver could not get the vehicle moved. Oncoming train within minutes could not stop before striking trailer. Train engine came to rest within 100 yards of impact. Drivers had exited the tractor prior to impact, so no injuries. Train was returned to service as soon equipment was moved enough to allow it. Freight damage was result of impact, though much of remaining consignment was delivered to the local consignee. An emergency response firm was lined up by CRST's national response contractor, CURA Emergency Services, to handle the cleanup, site remediation (which was minimal (no excavation) and disposal. There was no evacuation of people, just disruption of local road and rail service until scene was cleared. It took approximately 12 hours total to clear scene, including transload of unaffected product for delivery to the local consignee.",Drivers will be counseled on track clearances with raised crossings and it suitabilty for tractor-trailer crossing.

The Railroad Dispatcher was notified who contacted John Vergis, Asst. Environmental Officer with the wheeling and Lake Erie Railway, to handle the situation.  Emergency Services were then notified and when they arrived on scene, they worked with employees of A and J Enterprises, who loaded the car the night before, to assess and mitigate the leak if possible.  The car was released from the loading facility and the conductor did not see the loading fitting was still attached to the car. When A and J employees climbed the car, it was noticed that the Snappy Joe fitting that they used the night before to load the car was still in tact and had started leaking.  They closed the liquid line valve that was left open, stopping the leak, and then removed the Snappy Joe and then also plugged the liquid valve.

It was a 55-gallon poly drum containing Oxidizers generated from a Hennepin County household hazardous waste collection event.  As such, the group isolated this container and moved the drum outside of the building, to the east side and down wind.  Soon after the container continued to self-react, tipped on its side and the lid became dislodged from the top of the drum.  It then self-ignited and started on fire.  No noticeable liquids came out of the drum as the contents were mainly solids.  At the incipient stage, the Veolia employees attempted to extinguish the fire utilizing 2 – ABC Fire Extinguishers however they were unsuccessful in extinguishing the fire. Both the MN Duty Officer and the local fire department were contacted.  The City of Spring Lake Park Fire Marshall, Garrett J. Parten arrived on scene with 2 additional firemen.  The two (2) firemen donned their SCBA and spread the material to extinguished the fire.  The fire was extinguished at approximately 6:15 pm. All local emergency response team members were off-site by 6:30 pm.  There were no injuries resulting from this incident.    Additional absorbent was mixed in with the waste material and the resultant mix was repackaged into 2-55 gallon steel open head drums and sent for disposal.","To ensure this incident is not repeated, Veolia communicated a company-wide safety alert to emphasize the need to retrain employees who are packaging oxidizing materials at household hazardous waste collection events. The training focused on packaging solid oxidizers separate from liquid oxidizers whenever possible. In addition, the inner container integrity must be verified to ensure there are no releases of material from inner containers.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Removable head plastic drum,1H2,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected UTLX 201225 finding evaporating product around the manway nozzle and all eight manway securement bolts tool tight. The responder suspected that the manway gasket was not sealing properly and a response contractor was called to inspect the manway gasket condition and replace it if necessary. The response contractor reported the manway seal numbered 4893205 was intact. Four of the eight manway securement swing bolt nuts on one side of the manway lid were overly tightened with the other four on the opposite side of the lid were tool tight to the expected torqueness.  The fiber manway gasket was found intact but compressed at the location were the securement bolts were overly tightened which resulted in the gasket not sealing properly at the compressed gasket site. The manway gasket was replaced with a Salco nitrile gasket and the manway was properly resecured. Afterwards, UTLX 201225 was moved and isolated in the railyard so the response contractor could test for leakproofness of the manway seal the next morning. Nitrogen was used to increase the internal pressure to 15 psi and no further product leakage was detected.  The manway was resealed with seal TIS 5607 and the valve housing cover with seal TIS 5608.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings which would include recommended practices for manway gasket installation and manway securement bolt sequential tightening and torqueness.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, Tidal Energy Marketing Inc. was notified thru CHEMTREC # 2012-05-14-00247. Marion Environmental Services, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found 5 of the 8 man-way securement bolts were in the down position and the man-way gasket was missing. Marion Environmental replaced the gasket and tightened all the man-way bolts. The issue identified and corrective actions were provided to shipper representative Jason Booth, 403-671-473. The car was released for transportation to destination. This incident did require a special switch move.

As the dry disconnect hose was removed from the railcar fitting, the hose was dropped to the ground and as a result the valve handle struck the rail track forcing the valve to open. About a gallon of n-Pentane was released from the hose and was contained in the track spill pan before it evaporated. No drains, water, or soil were impacted by the release. Upon investigation, it was discovered that this valve did not have a catch mechanism on the valve handle subsequently causing the release when the valve handle struck the rail when it was dropped.","Upon investigation, it was discovered that this unit did not have a catch on the valve handle subsequently causing the release when hit against the rail. The first corrective action was to review hose handling procedures to ensure transload employees are aware that without the catching mechanism a release could occur any time the handle hits the ground or solid surface. The second corrective action is to replace the valve handle on the product hose with one that has a catching mechanism on the handle to prevent accidental opening of valve.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Kinder Morgan Materials Services,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper Bayer Corp, was notified via CHEMTREC report # 2012-05-23-00285. Summit Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found both liquid valves to be in the open position. The valve secondary closure plugs on the B-end liquid and the left side vapor, were less than tool tight. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Chad Blake 304-281-4864. Contractor personnel closed all valves, tightened the secondary closure plugs and decontaminated the protective housing. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders inspected UTLX 75619 for the odor source. The manway closure was found secure, along with the valves and fittings under the valve housing cover. Inspection of the Midland 75psi pressure relief valve (PRV) concluded that the PRV was the odor source. Further inspection of the PRV revealed that the PRV O-rings (seat and stem) appeared deteriorated (compression set failure) and the O-ring retainer/keeper was corroded. Since the PRV O-rings were not sealing properly, the responders replaced the O-rings. After the PRV was reassembled and spillage around the PRV wiped, no further product odor was detectable. Intact seal ExxonMobil 8077 at the valve housing cover was replaced by seal BNSF 06157137. Intact seal UTC 11042 at the PRV was replaced by seal BNSF D051713.

The driver immediately pulled over to the side of the road to investigate and discovered a leaking IBC of Sodium Hydroxide Liquid. The valve from the IBC was broken off. The driver called the Amrex Chemical Co. Buffalo office for assistance and 2 Amrex employees came to assess the scene and assist. After diking the material, the Woodlawn Fire Company was called. The fire department called in the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation for clean-up assistance. National Vacuum Corporation was called in by the NYS DEC to clean up the scene.The valve broke off the IBC after being struck by a pallet jack that shifted during transport. This caused the entire contents of the IBC to leak into the truck and onto the side of the roadway. The release duration was immediate to the time that the tote discharged all contents. Mitigation was the immediate diking and initial cleanup and further dean-up procedures as directed by the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation and conducted by National Vacuum Corporation.","Affected personnel, including driver, were immediately re-trained on proper loading and securement with the emphasis on iBCs, load devices, and proper placement within the vehicle to ensure that valves are protected.",Yes,IBC,"Plastic, freestanding, for liquids",31H2,Yes,,,,,,,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,22214,AMREX CHEMICAL CO INC,US,

A METAL FRAGMENT WAS PROTRUDING FROM THE INSIDE OF THE TRAILER AND IT CONTACTED THE SIDE OF THE TOTE, CAUSING A PUNCTURE IN THE TOTE APPROXIMATELY 36 INCHES FROM THE BOTTOM. THE TOTE WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED FROM THE TRAILER AND TILTED TO PREVENT FURTHER LEAKAGE. AS A RESULT, APPROXIMATELY 30 GALLONS OF THE SOLUTION LEAKED INSIDE THE TRAILER AND ONTO THE DOCK AREA. THE TRAILER FLOOR ALSO LEAKED AND THE SOLUTION CONTAMINATED THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRAILER AND THE CONCRETE DRIVEWAY UNDER THE TRAILER.  ACTION TAKEN:  THE LME DRIVER CALLED THE CARRIER (LAKEVILLE MOTOR EXPRESS) TO REPORT THE RELEASE. LME PERSONNEL CALLED ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, INC., AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPANY FOR THE CARRIER.  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT DISPATCHED A LOCAL QUALIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL COMPANY TO PERFORM THE CLEANUP ACTIVITIES. THE CLEANUP CREW MADE ENTRY INTO THE TRAILER AND USED SODA ASH, CLAY ABSORBENTS AND ABSORBENT PADS TO DECONTAMINATE THE DOCK AREA, THE TRAILER FLOOR, THE OUTSIDE OF THE TRAILER AND THE CONCRETE DRIVEWAY. THE LEAKING TOTE WAS EMPTIED BY TRANSFERRING THE CONTENTS INTO A REPLACEMENT TOTE AND THE LABELS WERE TRANSFERRED ONTO THE NEW TOTE. THE DAMAGED TOTE WAS DECONTAMINATED AND WIPED CLEAN. THE CONTAMINATED ABSORBENTS WERE COLLECTED AND PLACED INTO A WASTE DRUM FOR DISPOSAL. THE DAMAGED TOTE WAS WRAPPED IN PLASTIC SHEETING FOR DISPOSAL. ALL WASTE FROM THE CLEANUP ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN SENT FOR PROPER DISPOSAL. PACKAGE FAILURE: THE TOTE WAS DAMAGED BY A METAL PROTRUSION INSIDE THE TRAILER.  DURATION OF RELEASE:  THE RELEASE IS ESTIMATED AT 30 GALLONS, BASED ON THE REMAINING LIQUID IN THE DAMAGED TOTE.","Yes, additional training both from a operating procedure (better trailer inspections prior to loading )and general knowledge (clearer understanding of haz-mat paperwork) stand point is being planned so that all employees are better equipped to handle Hazardous Material.

He claims he smelled the chemical once he entered the trailer, and supervisor went it to verify this, and accordingly found it to be true. He placed the 3 skids of the shipment on the dock, and upon inspecting them supervisor found spillage coming down a few of the 5-gal drums and onto the PLT, and indication of a forklift blade having punctured one of the drums. supervisor  investigated the history of the PRO, called chemtrec and Con-Way's Safety Department, and then assigned clean up of the spill and contained it in OS&D after signing a PPE and obtaining the equipment neccessary for safely cleaning the spill. (4) 5-GAL Steel Drums were contained in a 50GAL Drum [3 of which were damaged, 1 which had paint spilled on it]. 0.5Liquid GAL were Spilt. Release appears to have been momentary, likely lasting less than 5mins.     The PLT which incured damage was found to contain 32 5-GAL Drums (16Drums double stacked). The puncture appears to have occured on one of the Drums on the bottom, on one of the corners, causing a shifting of several other drums, 2 more of which were damaged.

The leak source was identified at the liquid valve's closure flange which was not secured tool tight. All four flange bolts were tool tightened at least one full turn and after securement no further product leaks were observed. Spillage around the valve housing area was hand wiped with absorbent pads. All impacted ballast/soils were collected and placed into drum liners along with other cleaning materials and earmarked for appropriated disposal. On 6/13/2012, TJRX 30021 was moved to the facility's containment area (pit) and its exterior was washed using detergent and high pressured hot water.

Once zero pressure is reached, the trailer is to be vented and the remainder of the offload is completed solely by the use of the product pump.  The product pump is a gear driven Mag Drive pump.       The driver was instructed to connect the nitrogen line to the chicago fitting on the air inlet line and build head pressure. Once the desired pressure was achieved, the two emergency shut off valves on the nose, rear of trailer and the product valve were opened.  At the same time Albemarle Warehouse personnel turned on the customer’s product pump.  Once it was confirmed product was flowing from the hose to the pump the driver was instructed to remove the nitrogen line from the trailer.      The driver removed the nitrogen line from the chicago fitting, but did not open the valve to vent the trailer.  This is where the problem occurred.  The driver, hired in  December 2011, had never been to a facility that used nitrogen to unload.  His unfamiliarity with nitrogen confused him on the necessary procedure to vent the trailer.  He did ask questions to the        Albermarle emergency response team assessed the release.  The area was diked, and water mist was created to address any fumes.  Air quality tested was conducted on the perimeter of the plant, no evacuation was required. There was a slow drip of product coming from the rear belly of the trailer.  It was estimated that 90 gallons of product remained on the trailer.  The product valve was removed and the remaining product was off loaded through this line using a diaphragm pump. 300 gallons were off loaded from the trailer and later disposed of in the plant’s waste treatment. Finally the trailer was flushed with water till it reached a ph of 5-6.      The trailer remained in the containment area until Wayne’s Truck and Trailer could assess the damage.  It was found that the trailer was a total loss and remains at the plant until it can be determined the best course of action to transport it.","  Once completing the investigation of the incident it was clear that in order to prevent this incident from reoccurring that improvements to the training program are necessary.      The driver did receive re-training with the Driver Trainer, the Director of Maintenance and Director of Safety.  During the training emphasis was given on the proper procedures for offloading product using air pressure to prime the pump when a customer site utilizes a pump system. The training also included a comprehensive review of each valve and their function.  For example why does the emergency shutoff valves have to be open in order to offload the trailer.      Currently the Driver Trainer program is being updated to specifically address this incident. It was clear that the driver was trained and had knowledge on how to properly pump off product, however when the customers process utilized nitrogen during the offloading process this changed the driver initial training procedures with this unloading application.  It is recognized that our training regarding Nitrogen is  typically discussed in the introduction of when flammable products are handled. This driver had not completed that training when the incident occurred.  Additionally the daily evaluation sheets will be enhanced to better document the progression of the trainee's knowledge of the unloading process.      Finally the incident will be address at all safety meetings over the next three months.  The review will include the drivers actions, the steps leading up to the incident and the improved training methods.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,58500,"K-Limited Carrier, Ltd.",US,

SWS Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the bottom outlet cap to be leaking. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, John Wohlgemth, 913-426-5624. Contractor personnel attempted to close the bottom outlet valve, however, it would not close completely, SWS replaced the BOV cap gasket to secure the leak.

The fuel was essentially projected outside of the containment area to the roadway.  Fuel reached a few catch basins on the road, which were pumped out and washed within a few hours of the spill.  Any residual fuel on the road was absorbed with kitty litter and swept up.  There is a small vegetated strip next to the road that was impacted with approximately 20 gallons of the fuel, which accounts for the post spill remediation costs.  Emerald is still working with local agencies to finish clean-up to the vegetated strip.","Trucks that will be loading or unloading at this facility are now required to be several feet within the facility's containment area such that any accidental releases stay in containment rather than reaching the roadway, vegetated strips, and catch basins.

Shotwell St,Bainbridge,GA,39819,Carrier,"A Total Petroleum, LLC driver was dispatched to unload dyed diesel in an above ground tank for a customer.  The transport trucks owned and operated by Total Petroleum, LLC drivers are equipped with pumps to unload product.  The pumps have one intake port and a discharge port on the left and right side of the trucks.  The Total Petroleum, LLC driver was in the process of unloading the fuel in the tank from the right side of the truck and within 25' of the pump when he noticed fuel accumlating under the tanker.  He immediately went around to the left side of the truck and stopped the pumped, located the source of the fuel and corrected the problem.  We determined that a 3"" cap that was covering the left side discharge port had vibrated loose and allowed the fuel to spill.      The driver immediately contacted Roger Whitworth, Director of Wholesale Operations and I was on site within 15 minutes of the spill.  Once on site I contacted Enviromental Hazmat Services, Inc. a company that we retain for spills and Mike Floyd Paving and Excavating.  Clean up of the spill site started within 2 hours of the initial discharge of diesel fuel.","The 3"" cap that vibrated loose is equipped with ""locking ears"" to secure the cap to the discharge port.  To prevent the ears from vibrating loose in the future we inpected the caps on all trucks that belong to Total Petroleum, LLC to insure that they were working properly.

TRAILER HAS 5 COMPARTMENT-3000-1500-1200-1000-2500. THE CHEVRON RACK DOES NOT LOAD THE ETHANOL PRODUCT WITH THE GASOLINE PRODUCT AT THE SAME TIME SO IT HAS TO BE LOADED SEPARATELY AND THEN COMBINED WITHIN EACH COMPARTMENT. THIS IS AN ANTIQUATED WAY OF LOADING BUT IT IS WHAT THE DRIVERS HAVE TO DO AND THE DRIVER NEEDS TO CONCENTRATE AND BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN DOING THIS. THE DRIVER LOADED ALL OF THE COMPARTMENTS WITH THE CORRECT PERCENTAGE OF ETHANOL THAT WAS NEEDED FOR THE TOTAL OF PRODUCT. THEN, THE DRIVER HAS TO GO BACK AND LOAD ON TOP OF THE PERCENTAGE OF ETHANOL IN EACH COMPARTMENT. THE DRIVER HAD COMPARTMENT 1 (3000) AND COMPARTMENT 4 (1000) AND COMPARTMEMT 5 (2000) TOTALLY LOADED. HE STARTED TO LOAD COMPARTMENT 2 & 3 WITH THE GASOLINE WHEN HE REALIZED THAT HE HAD CONNECTED THE LOADING HEADS TO THE WRONG COMPARTMENTS. WHEN HE STOPPED EVERYTHING AND SWITCHED THEM BACK THE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LOADED AT THE SAME RATE. THE DIDN'T. COMPARTMENT 3 FINISHED LOADING AND TOTALED OUT @ 1000. BUT COMPARTMENT 2 HOLDS 1500 AND BLEW OUT 15-20 GALLONS OUT THE TOP. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED FROM COMING OUT OF THE TOP BY THE ELECTRONIC PROBE SYSTEM BUT IT FAILED. THIS TRAILER WAS JUST REPAIRED AND TESTED. THE FUEL DRIPPED DOWN THE SIDES OF THE TRAILER INTO THE HOSE TRAYS AND ONTO THE FLOOR BASIN OF THE CONTAIMENT AREA UNDER THE CONTROLLED AREA OF THE LOADING RACK. THE FUEL RESIDUAL WAS COLLECTED BY AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLEAN-UP COMPANY (CBI) AND DISPOSED OF BY THEM. THEY ARE CONTRACTED BY CHEVRON AS THEIR OSRO. THEY HAD A VAC TRUCK AND OTHER EQUIPMENT TO CLEAN THE CONTAINMENT AREA. NO FUEL WENT INTO ANY WATER OR LEFT THE CONTAINMENT AREA.","THE TRAILER WAS TESTED WHEN REPAIRED BUT IT FAILED TO REACT CORRECTLY WHEN AN OVERFILL SITUATION OCCURRED. THE TRAILER REPAIR FACILITY HAS TAKEN THE TRAILER BACK AND LOOKED IT OVER AGAIN AND REPAIRED AGAIN. DRIVER WAS COUNSELED ON THE CORRECT LOADING PROCEDURES AT THE CHEVRON TERMINAL AND THEN TERMINATED. EVEN THOUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPANY WAS CONTRACTED BY CHEVRON, WE PAID FOR THE CLEANUP. I'M SORRY THAT I WAS NOT INFORMED THAT YOU, THE NRC, WAS CALLED IN ON SUCH A SMALL SPILL, BUT WE HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY AND FEEL THAT WE HAVE REMEDIDED THE SITUATION AS FAR AS WE CAN. WE HAVE SINCE HAD A MEETING WITH OUR DRIVERS IN FT. LAUDERDALE AND GONE OVER THE LOADING PROCEDURES OF THE CHEVRON RACK.
