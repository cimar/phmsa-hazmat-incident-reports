When the trailer was being unloaded, the material handler observed some liquid in the nose of the trailer on the floor. The leaking drum was identified and removed from the trailer to be over packed. Upon inspection, the drum was discovered to be leaking from the chime on the bottom of the drum. Further inspection of the drum showed a significant amount of rust on the bottom of the container. Veolia believes the rust is an indication of degradation of the container. Due to the viscosity of the material we did not see specifically how large the hole or failure was. Approximately 5 gallons of material leaked from the container. Floor dry and spill pads were used to soak up the material. All spill debris and contaminated PPE were placed in the a new drum for final disposal.","Because this appears to be a degradation issue of the drum, Veolia has communicated to the original generator and the original transporter requesting that they inspect the integrity of drums prior to shipment.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

When they arrivewd They learned the driver had both SDS sheets for the 2291 Poison and a 3077 Corrosive.  The liquid was PH Tested and was found to be a Ph of 0 making it a HIGHLY Corrosive product.  The barrels were standard steel drims  not lined to handle this type of a corrosive. The barrel that was leaking was loaded mid way up the left side of the trailer and the acid had eaten the bottone seam of the leaking barrel. The leaking barrel and the adjacent pallet had both damaged barrels and the leaking product removed the paint allong the leaking seam. This was not viewable by the driver after the loading was completed. However the driver was restricted from viewing the loading and this was intentionally hidden in the center of the load Per the lewis Enviromental scene supervisor.",NO COMMENT PROVIDED.,No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,69,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10000,"RDX, LLC",US,

There is a tag on the end of the hose that they are supposed to be looking at when hooking up for offloading.

The source of the release was a faulty vacuum relief valve (VRV). The tank car was isolated and Marion  Environmental Inc. a Conrail approved response contractor was dispatched to the scene as well as Joe  Caccamo Conrail Hazardous Material Manager. Upon additional inspection it was confirmed that product  vapors were escaping from the VRV. The tank car was depressurized and the VRV was removed. A 2.5""  steel plug was then properly secured in its place.

Local operations isolated the car and setout to track 601 where it was inspected by US Ecology.  At approximately 14:00 PST US Ecology was able to determine that there had been a small (<1 gallon) release of Gas Oil to the car body.  The cause was due to a torn manway nozzle gasket and two less than tool tight manway swing bolts.  A new manway gasket was installed and the car was secured, cleaned and released for transportation.  There were no ground impacts of gas oil and no additional remediation necessary.",Shipper/Tank Car repair should ensure that repairs are completed in a manner that will not result in a release of material while the car is in transportation.(NAR:209),No,,,111S100W,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1500,BNSF - BNSF Railway Company,US,

The car was isolated and EcoLab/Nutrien, the NRC were notified.  CHEMTREC Report #2020-0826-00370. RMS, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the valve open and product migrating through the secondary closure threads. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Sergio Navarro, 970-222-3655. Contractor personnel closed the valve handle and taped the threads on the secondary closure nut and decontaminated the valve fitting cleaned up spilled material. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did require a special switching move.

Investigation of the incident had revealed that another skid was double stacked next to the tote. The skid fell over on top of the tote causing the tote to crack and material to be released. The released material was absorbed using absorbent pads and containerized to be disposed of properly. The damaged tote was secured to prevent further release until contents could be transferred into another tote.,This incident may have been prevented had the other freight been properly blocked and braced for transit. The responsible employee involved in loading the freight was disciplined and re-trained per company policy to prevent future incidents from occurring.

The drum was moved and prepped for transport. The drum, unknown by the branch employees started to react again. Due to it being placed into a salvage drum no one noticed the reaction until enough pressure had built up to blow the lid off both the original container and the salvage drum. Paint was contained in the salvage drum, with minor spraying on the out side of the salvage drum. A crew was brought in, put on all the proper PPE, and evaluated the contents of the drum. The reaction was stopped by solidifying the paint. The waste was placed into proper containers and shipped off to the final disposal sight.

Veolia was the subcontractor hired to manage the event and transport the collected materials for ultimate disposal. The day of the event, the weather was heavy rain due to remnants of a tropical storm passing through the area. At the end of the event, all containers of household hazardous waste were loaded onto the Veolia vehicle. Many of the containers were wet due to the heavy rain. Following the event, the vehicle was driven to Veolia's 10 transit facility in Marlborough, MA and parked there over the remainder of the weekend. On Monday morning, Veolia employees returning to the office noticed a pool of liquid under the vehicle. It is estimated that approximately 5 gallons of paint related material leaked out of a pinhole on a reconditioned drum. The hole appears to be a defect in the reconditioned container. Employees reinspected all containers for leaks and overpacked the leaking container for continued transportation.","Veolia managers have re-evaluated the use of reconditioned drums. In addition, the incident was reviewed with the employees who worked at the HHW collection event. Veolia typically performs a thorough inspection of containers for leaks prior to shipping however, due to the wet weather and the drums being wet from the rain, the leak was hard to identify.

While driving, one container fell from the pallet onto the asphalt parking lot at the Part B Permitted Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility located at Heritage Environmental Services, 8525 NE 38th Street, Kansas City, Missouri. The asphalt parking area where the spill occurred was within the spill containment/control structure at this facility.  The container landed on its side and the lid came off resulting in approximately fifty gallons or four-hundred-eighty-six pounds of waste printing ink being spilled.  The fork-truck operator and facility employees immediately began spill response and control procedures.  Response time for the containment and cleanup was approximately 1.5 hours.  Heritage personnel acted appropriately and promptly in accordance with the Contingency Plan to contain the material.  Material Involved in Incident: Approximately fifty gallons of waste printing ink was released, identified on line 1 of manifest 021493822JJK, RQ,UN1210,WASTE PRINTING INK,3,PGIII,(D001 @ 100LBS),ERG#129.  Heritage Transport had possession of this material as it was manifested to Rineco Chemical Industries, LLC in Benton, Arkansas.  Approximately 1,024 pounds of clay absorbent and rags were recovered and placed into two 85-gallon containers for proper disposal.","Recommendations/Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence:  Based on the incident review, the pallet that the shipper provided for the containers was not adequately constructed to hold the weight of the containers.  When the pallet of containers was moved, the pallet broke because the boards were not strong enough to hold the weight of the containers.  When the pallet broke, this caused the drum to fall, then the lid to bend and the contents of the container to spill out.  Heritage conducted an incident review and training on August 31, 2020.  Heritage employees will replace insufficient, broken or damaged pallets when needed.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"HERITAGE TRANSPORT, LLC",US,

The car was isolated and ROHMM & HAAS, New Orleans Fire Dept., Louisiana State Police, were notified CHEMTREC Report # 2020-08-30-00031. SPSI, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that a small vapor release from the pressure relief device. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Brian Hopkins 989-636-1483. Contractor personnel inspected the tank car a found that the man-way lid gasket was damaged, but not the source of the vapor release. The source of the release was from the pressure relief device, although it was found to be free of defects and operating properly. We conclude that the release from the pressure relief device was from handling of the car during transportation. SPSI replaced the man-way gasket and inspected the pressure relief device. The leak was secured and the car released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move. NARRI Cause Code 700 Hydraulic Surge NARRI 2(5+3+5) X (2+0) = 52.

The driver of the semi-tractor and trailer stopped on the shoulder of Interstate I-10 to investigate the problem when he saw the PRD releasing pressure into the air. The pressure on the cargo tank trailer was 150 psi and the set pressure of the PRD was 265 psi, so he immediately called 911. LA Hazmat, Prairieville FD, ST. George Parish FD and LA Department of Environmental Air Quality arrived on scene.  The LA hazmat department arrived and started spraying water onto the cargo trailer and the Department of Environmental Air Quality started monitoring air quality in the area. Another cargo trailer was dispatched to the scene to transfer product from the leaking transport. The propane was transferred into another cargo tank. The duration of the incident was approximately 6 hours.  It was determined upon inspection of the cargo tank and the PRD that a baffle that was welded to the interior wall of the cargo tank had broken loose from its welds and hit the PRD shearing it off inside the trailer causing the stem to get knocked of its seat allowing vapors to escape into the atmosphere.","All inspections will be done in accordance with DOT-SP 14689 dated April 22, 2016  7.   SAFETY CONTROL MEASURES:  a.  PACKAGING - Prescribed packagings are DOT Specification MC-331 cargo tank motor vehicles with a  water capacity greater than 3,500 gallons, manufactured to the DOT MC-331 specification,  constructed of QT steel by Trinity Industries, Inc. between 1996 and 2006 with baffle support clips  welded directly to the inside of the cargo tank wall without the use of pads.  b.  INSPECTIONS AND TESTS – As part of the pressure test required by § 180.407(g), the required  internal inspection must include a detailed inspection of appurtenances (baffles, bolting, clips,  pads, piping or other internals), their attachment to the cargo tank wall and the interior wall of  the cargo tank.  (1)  Baffles that cannot be inspected as installed shall be detached or removed for inspection and  evaluation.  (2)  The area of direct weld attachment to the shell of baffles, or clips must be inspected for  cracking, corrosion, weld defects or other defects that may cause the baffle or clip to detach from  the shell.  Non- ferrous baffles or clips must be examined by the Liquid Penetrant method; ferrous  baffles or clips must be examined by the Wet Fluorescent Magnetic Particle method.  Non-Destructive  Examination (test methodology, tester qualifications, and documentation) must be in accordance with ASME Section V.  (i)  Any cracked or corroded clips must be replaced with material whose properties are equivalent  to that of the cargo tank wall, or a material approved by a Design Certified Engineer (DCE).  (ii)  Any damaged, cracked or corroded baffles attached directly to the shell must be repaired, r replaced.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,4054,GRAMMER INDUSTRIES INC,US,

As a result of the puncture, approximately three(3) gallons on UN1830 was released to the loading dock floor and pallet. RLC retained Cura Emergency Services, LC(CES) to manage the cleanup. CES dispatched a crew from Ancon Services(AS) to initiate corrective actions. AS personnel transferred the UN1830 material from the damaged 15-gallon drum into three(3) 5-gallon pail. Crews deployed a neutralizing agent to lower the pH of the material. Crews utilized a pH test strip to ensure the material was neutralized. AS personnel then deployed granular absorbent to the loading dock floor and worked them in using hand tools. Crews then broke down the pallet to take for disposal. All UN1830 impacted material was collected and containerized in three(3) 5-gallon pails and 2 55-gallon drums for transport and disposal.

The driver connected the hose back on to the loading/unloading valve to contain the release.   The release occurred into the 2.5 gallon spill bucket  and onto concrete surface in the containment  area.   On-site personnel told the driver to go inside and as a precaution evacuated the containment area.  Our driver tried to refuse but AMPAC staff insisted - the driver finally complied.  On-site response staff took control of the tanker trailer and attempted to empty the tanker by  pumping the material back into their tanks.  This was unsuccessful.  A second Clean Harbors  Environmental truck was dispatched to empty the tanker, utilizing a vacuum trailer.  No further  incident or spill happened.  The empty tank trailer was then rendered out of service and taken  to the tank shop for inspection.","This particular tank was thoroughly inspected to include gaskets, valves and sealing devices. This  tank came from the factory with stainless steel valves and Teflon gaskets.  They should not  have deteriorated as they are impervious to solvents.  We have since learned from the tank inspector  that a small amount of sand had collected in the valve channel prohibiting it from closing securely.

UTLX 125697 contained a load of waste sulphuric acid. KCS Environmental and Hazmat mobilized a railroad qualified response contractor to investigate and mitigate the release. Upon arrival, the response contractor found the release emanating from the non-reclosing pressure relief device- the frangable rupture disc on UTLX 125697 had opened. While replacing the frangable rupture disc, the responder noticed that it had been installed up-side-down. Because the wrong side of the disc had been exposed to product, the disc had corroded, thus causing the failure. A new frangable rupture disc was correctly installed, product removed from the outside of the car, and all other closures checked for securement. Once the car had been secured, it was released back into transportation. Estimated product release was approximately one gallon. File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered in this package is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The Kansas City Southern Railway(KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases(NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal InJury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases(a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.(Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

When the vehicle came to a rest the driver exited the cab. He called 911. The Marietta FD were on the scene in approximately 5-10 minutes. Upon arrival the MFD crews along with Marietta Public Works had placed a sand berm across Roswell Road approximately 4 feet wide by 18"" tall spanning all four lanes downgradient from the truck. Remtech Engineers arrived on site(0940), Marietta Wrecker Service was on site assisting MFD with recovery of the fuel that was Ieaking from the tanker into a containment pool with a small air powered pump(placing fuel into drums). After conferring with fire command and MWS, equipment was moved into position to stabilize the truck for hot tapping the tank and pulling product from the three compartments. Remtech utilized one of our two vacuum trucks on scene to remove fuel while the second truck was set up as emergency containment/ recovery downstream in case of a breach.
