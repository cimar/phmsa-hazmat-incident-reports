Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence.     It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.  Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O. Box 219335, Kansas City, MO 64121.  The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Sasol North America was contacted via CHEMTREC report number 2013-0804-00056.  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found product dripping from the threaded connection of the 2 inch plug with the bottom outlet cap.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to Sasols representative Marcus Boutte at 337-494-5140.   Contractor personnel replaced the defective plug and temporarily secured the rail car.  The shipper, Sasol contacted the Federal Railroad Administration to obtain a one-time movement approval due to the fact that the bottom outlet valve may be damaged allowing product to leak past the closure.  On August 5th the FRA granted a verbal OTMA FRA-130805R2V.  This incident did not require a special switching move.

When he completed the delivery of Chem Quip purchased goods, Orlando decided to re-stack (onto an additional pallet for each) the 2 remaining pallets, containing three (3) each Sulfuric Acid 93% 55 gallon drums, on the back of the trailer to avoid complications at the next delivery site (as driver claims the original pallets were bowing inward and prevented his pallet jack from fully entering the pallets, however, pallets were not secured from driver upon his return to the Medley facility to determine if this was indeed the case). Orlando  pushed the tips of the pallet jack in as far as they would go, lifted one end of the pallet, and drug it to the rear of the trailer. Then to restack the pallets, Orlando used a Chem Quip forklift.  The forklift was on the ground at the rear of the TSUI trailer.  He moved the forks under the original pallet and lifted the original pallet high enough to slide a fresh pallet underneath then lowered the original pallet on top.  However, when performing this operation on the second pallet, Orlando punctured one of the Sulfuric Acid 93% drums with the forklift fork, causing a 3” wide opening.  Sulfuric Acid spilled from the drum onto the trailer and then to the customer’s parking lot.  The forklift fork also squeezed/pinched another drum on the same pallet, but this drum did not leak. Orlando entered his trailer, and turned the drum on its side to stop the leak.  He proceeded to borrow a hose from the customer and wash down not only his trailer, but the affected parking lot with water. Customer assisted Orlando, adding Sodium Bicarbonate onto the spilled area.    Orlando notified called Miami Dispatch (Joe Isla) to report what had taken place directly after laying the drum on its side and washing the trailer and floor (approx. 11:10-15 AM).  Joe Isla advised Leo DeLeon, Plant Manager, of a drum of Sulfuric Acid leaking at ChemQuip, on the TSUI trailer.  Leo and Joe called to customer, asking them to move it with their forklift truck (with Leo advising them off to do safely).  After the conversation, Leo dispatched to the scene two plant employees, one an emergency responder, Jesus Carjuapoma, and Percy DeLeon, Medley drum fill operator, along with an overpack drum, extra drums, neutralization materials. Leo stated it was his understanding that the drum failed due to damage, but he was not aware the drum was struck with by our driver with a forklift truck.    When I, Jaimie Johnson, returned to the plant in the afternoon, I was notified at approximately 1:15P by Leo D’ Leon  (Plant Manager) of ChemQuip having a leaking Sulfuric Acid drum.

The securment appears sound; no evidence of load shift.  The spill was due to a small crack in the center of a larger dent in the steel drum.  The crack was quite small, releasing a few ounces of paint which pooled up and eventually leaked outside of the container where it was noted by rail personnel.  Most likely this dent occured during loading, likely from a blow received by other cargo handled by forklift or similar loading device.

Emergency Response group inspected top dome area of car and found material coming from the valve protective housing cover. After opening of housing cover noted a hissing noise and some drop of material coming from bottom flange area of unloading connection valve. The vacuum relief valve located on top of manway cover was pushed down to release the pressure in the car. After this was done the material stopped dipping from the bottom flange area of the valve. Further inspection of the area in question found the 4 mounting bolt nuts were loose by hand. The nuts in question were made tool tight and car was released for service.It should be noted the temp. at the time was 100 degrees (F) which probably increased the pressure in the vessel and creating the leak to become noticeable.

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders immediately inspected UTLX 631192. The responders reported no shipper seal at the valve housing cover and commodity drips were emanating from the liquid valve's closure plug. The responders reduced the internal pressure within UTLX 631192 via the vapor valve which took almost an hour. Afterwards, the commodity drips from the liquid valve's closure plug ceased. The liquid valve's operating handle was on the valve stem but was not secured by a retaining nut; the liquid valve's closure plug was not tool tight. It appeared that the valve housing cover when closed contacted the liquid valve's operating handle forcing it downwards past the valve stop which opened the liquid valve; when coupled with a loose closure plug and internal tank car pressure allowed commodity to escape via the loose closure plug. Responders closed the liquid valve and tool tightened its closure plug to secure this fitting. The liquid valve's operating handle was removed from its valve stem and placed within the valve housing area. Spillage on UTLX 631192's side shell was neutralized and cleaned.

The inner was a thin plastic bag and it was inteneed to be sealed with a zip tie type closure. The zip tie was not closed al the way and the haz mat contents were able to spill out of the inner bag and into the fiberboard outer carton, this caused a stong odor, and a small amount of the haz mat also came out of the 4 of the fiberboard boxes and spilled onto the truck bed/skids.The freight forwarder was advised of this situation.

(SJ) driver entered GlobalFoundries Malta, NY plant to load tank trailer LTV253 with Waste Corrosive Liquid, Acidic, Inorganic NOS (Copper Sulfate, Sulfuric Acid), 8, PG II.  Upon completion of loading process the plant side operator shut off their pump and closed off their line.  SJ driver started his pump to clear SJ’s hoses, once that was completed he closed the internal valve, wiped the inside of the external valve dry and then closed and capped the external valve.  He removed the fittings, dried them with a hazmat pad over a 5 gallon bucket and stored the hoses in LTV253’s hose tray.  He then released vacuum on the trailer, put on some additional PPE went on LTV253 to get a stick reading of the tank for the customer.  When he went to the back of the trailer to sign the manifest there was a small drip going into the 5 gallon bucket that had a hazmat pad in it.  SJ driver uncapped the external valve; some additional material went into the 5 gallon bucket.  He checked the external valve handle, he tightened the handle and the leaking stopped.  GlobalFoundries requested SJ driver not wipe the external valve dry and leave the external valve uncapped for approximately 10 minutes to ensure there was no more leaking.  SJ driver then put vacuum back on the trailer, there was no more leaking and GlobalFoundries personnel was satisfied that the trailer was no longer leaking and released LTV253 to leave the plant.  No material ever hit the ground; all material was caught and contained in a 5 gallon bucket that had a hazmat absorbent pad in it.  SJ driver estimates about ¼ of a gallon of material was released into the 5 gallon bucket.",Upon SJ driver’s return to the yard he was retrained in vacuum procedures and trailer # LTV253 was taken out of service and scheduled for inspection in our maintenance facility.  It was discovered that the external valve handle was cracked which prevented the valve from closing properly when the driver originally closed the external valve.  The handle on the external valve was replaced and the trailer was put back in service.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SJ Transportation Co., Inc.",US,

As he was traveling down a hill Eastbound at 15 mph on Windy Rd in Ford County the trailer started to fish tail.  The trailer hit the berm on the dirt road and started to turn over, because of the tank turning over it snapped the hitch on the pickup.  The safety chains kept the pickup with the tank.  The Trailer ended up on its side the roll cage around the valves was damaged and the liquid valve was sheared off allowing a slow release of anhydrous ammonia.  The wind was out of the south at 10 mph on a sunny day. The employee was able to pull the pickup away from the tank and have someone bring out a water tank and started to pump water on the tank to slow the leaking.  An empty anhydrous ammonia trailer was positioned along side the leaking nurse tank.  A hose was connected between the two tanks to liquid transfer as much anhydrous as possible.  After the transfer the pressure in the leaking tank had dropped to the point where no more vapors were leaking.  A wrangler was used to lift the damaged nurse tank onto its wheels on the road. The damaged tank was transported back to the anhydrous ammonia plant empty.",Provide employees with additional driving safety tips when towing tanks.

While traveling westbound on Pleasant Rd at a speed of approximately 25 mph, the driver approached a blind hill and maneuvered the truck to the right shoulder.  Upon descending the hill, the driver noticed a vehicle approaching from the East.  The driver then maneuvered the truck further to the right and onto the edge of a newly applied ""chip seal"" road.  The driver's estimated speed at this point was approximately 20 mph.  As soon as the right steer tire on the truck reached the edge of the ""chip seal"" road, it drifted off the road and down into a steep ravine approximately 3 ft. deep.  Once the steer tire reached the bottom of the ravine, the load shifted and caused the driver to lose control of the truck.  The truck and trailer overturned on its passenger side and then rotated over to its driver's side before coming to rest.  The driver was not seriously injured, and no product was released from the cargo tank.  Emergency Services responded to the scene along with Company personnel.  The truck's load was transferred to another truck and wrecker services uprighted the truck successfully with no loss of product.","The root cause of this lay-over accident was due to inattentive driving.  Contributing factor included a newly ""chip seal"" road surface consisting of an 8-12"" soft edge which deceived the driver in believing the road edge was solid and sufficiently improved.

The amount of product that actually released is a best guess estimate because the cargo tank burned from the top down. The cargo tank was fully intact as it burned from a puncture high on the tank according to witnesses. It took approximately 2 hours for the truck to melt down from the fire as it consumed the gasoline that was in the cargo tank.,This accident was caused by a distracted driver who made the wrong choice as to what direction to turn his vehicle when he was about to rear end another vehicle. Our driver had no chance to react according to witnesses. The driver of the vehicle that hit us was arrested three days later for Involuntary Vehicular Manslaughter.

About 15 minutes into the transfer the lid came off the storage tank and about 150 gallons spilled out before the driver could shut down.  Most of it went into a containment area with about 50 gallons going on the concrete floor.  the exact cause of the incident is not known.

It was reported that a 55 gallon drum of the material was punctured releasing all 55 gallons to the interior of the trailer and the concrete below the trailer. ERTS spoke with terminal and he reported that he applied oil dry to attempt to keep the material from entering any drains, he stated that he did not believe any had entered a nearby drain. At 2053 EST, ERTS contacted GA DNR and tracking number 71825 was issued to this release. ERTS coordinated a response with a network contractor and an ETA will be provided as soon as it becomes available. The contractor confirmed that there is some free standing liquids in the bottom of the catch basin and it does appear that some of the material may have entered. At 0006 EST, ERTS contacted Officer Brent with the NRC and tracking number 1056542 was issued to this release. The contractor reported that an estimated 10 gallons had been released from the punctured drum impacting the interior of the trailer and an estimated 12' x 4' area of asphalt/ concrete. The contractor applied a neutralizer and worked in absorbents thoroughly and then containerized them. The contractor collected all free standing liquids from the catch basin.

A black pickup southbound failed to stay in his lane and entered our drivers lane causing him to take the truck off the highway. As the pup trailer was attempting to come back onto the roadway it tripped in the soft dirt and rolled over several times. The trailer was mortally damaged and 2940 gallons were released. The sandy soil soaked up all the residual fuel that spilled before we could get any kind of vacuum truck to recover any of it. The duration of the spill was approximately 3 hours from accident to clearing of all equipment.   Remediation was managed by LMH Environmental with current test results negative for ground water contamination. Contaminated soil was removed and remediation completed 2 weeks from the date of the accident.,Truck drivers are being trained in quarterly safety meetings to use defensive driving techniques to keep from leaving the roadway when encountering obstacles in their lane. Response time and duties have been discussed to shorten duration of time from accident till company response vehicles are dispatched to the scene.

PRODUCT BEGAN RELEASING IMMEDIATELY AND CONTINUED TO RELEASE FOR ABOUT 1.5 HRS. IN AN EFFORT TO SLOW THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT RELEASE, A BERN OF SAND WAS BUILT ALONG THE PERIMETER OF THE TRAILER. DURING THAT TIME, WE WERE ABLE TO PUMP THE REMAINING PRODUCT INTO ONE OF OUR OTHER TRAILERS. THE SPILLED PRODUCT WAS REMOVED THROUGH THE USE OF A VACUUM TRUCK SERVICE. SAND WAS THROWN ONTO THE SPILLED DIESEL FROM THE TRACTOR'S FUEL TANK UNTIL WE PLACED A CONTAINER UNDER THE LEAK TO CATCH THE PRODUCT.

GRASS SEED WAS ALSO PLANTED.","THROUGH OUR INVESTIGTION, WE GROUND SEVERAL FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT AND SPILL. THE RAILROAD CROSSING THROUGH THE PRIVATE ROAD TO THE WELL DOESN’T ALLOW ADEQUATE DISTANCE FOR A TRACTOR TRAILER TO CROSS, STOP, AND ENTER THE HIGHWAY SAFELY. THERE ARE ALSO NO ACTIVE SIGNALS TO ALERT THE DRIVER OF AN ONCOMING TRAIN. THE PRIVATE ROAD IS ALSO NARROW WHICH DOESN’T ALLOW A MARGIN OF ERROR WHEN NAVIGATING THE TURN ONTO THE HIGHWAY WHILE TRYING TO AVOID TRAFFIC. WE FOUND THAT THE LOCATION HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FOR THESE ISSUES. DUE TO THESE ISSUES, THE DRIVER WAS NOT CITED BY THE POLICE OFFICIAL. SINCE THERE WAS AN ONCOMING TRAIN AND THE DRIVER ACTED IN A MANNER TO AVOID A MORE SERIOUS INCIDENT, WE ADMINISTERED MINOR REPRIMAND TO THE DRIVER.

While performing his load check the driver found product, nitric acid, leaking from the trailer, a1984 Fruehauf MC-312 stainless steel tank trailer, at the bottom of the tank just forward of the top dome area. The material was coming from a weep hole in one of the ring stifferners. He immediately retrieved his on-board emergency response supplies and placed a 3 gallon plastic bucket under the leaking material to contain it. He notified local authorities and requested assistance from the local fire department. He also notified the company. The Waxahachie fire department responded and assisted the driver to contain the leaking material by providing more buckets to capture the leaking material. TAS Environmental from the FT Worth/Dallas area was dispatched to the scene to take over the containment of the leaking nitric, and to facilitate the transfer of the material. We could not locate a compatible trailer for nitric in the Dallas area so a nitric trailer and company response team were dispatched from El Dorado, AR and a Safety Supervisor was dispatched from Houston, TX.
