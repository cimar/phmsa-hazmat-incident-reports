He noticed a crimped down three (3) inch bung located on top of the IBC had popped off.  It is believed the release occurred within ten (10) minutes of identification as the driver noticed nothing out of the ordinary at his previous stop.  A supervisor was summoned to the site with a replacement lid.  The remnant was cleaned up and a replacement lid installed correcting the problem.  An investigation of the incident determined that the crimped bung was not completely sealed, eventually leading to the failure.

The car was isolated and the Willard, OH Fire Department was notified. CSXT's Manager-Hazardous Materials responded to the scene. At 03:55 a CSXT Hazmat manager inspected UTLX 950676, and noted a vapor cloud, approximately 2 feet wide x 6 feet long, emanating from within the protective housing. Operations about the tank car were curtailed. CSXT dispatched Eagle Construction + Environmental Services, Inc. (ECESI), Findlay, OH. ECESI personnel, along with two CSXT Hazardous Materials managers, inspected UTLX 950676 (Seal ""PCS 21010"" was intact on the protective housing). They broke the seal to inspect the fittings and found the ""B"" end liquid line valve open 1/2 turn with its plug being less than tool tight, both of which were corrected at that time. This allowed liquid to leak from this fitting. They also noted a vapor leak at the ""A"" end liquid line valve at the interface of the liquid line valve operating stem and its packing gland nut. The packing gland nut could not be tightened. A ""Midland"" style capping kit was employed to contain the release. Shipper representatives arrived and inspected the car, and a decision was made to transfer the tank car contents. Product from UTLX 950676 was transferred into PLMX 135552 on 09/11/08. Mr. Casebolt advised he would obtain FRA Movement Approval for UTLX 950676 to be returned to their Lima, OH facility.

This portable tank was loaded in Oakland on 9/10/08 and transited through Honolulu on 9/14/08 on it's way to Guam.  Shipper was contacted and he provided some direction of freeing-up the valve by pouring water over the valve. It was estimated that one gas gallon was dispersed, although due to the small relief valve orifice it is uncertain of the exact amount. The dispersement occurred for about 10 hours. The direction from shipper and possibly the change of the sun direction resulted in valve closing.",It is recommended that the shipper as well as the supplier place special attention to amount of product and condition of the relief valves for these shipments. They should also take into consideration the temperature changes these tanks will transit through for the period in route.,No,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Horizon Lines Inc.,US,

The car was isolated and Chemtrec (report number 2008092200178) assisted in contacting the shipper, Sabic Americas Incorporated.  Hepaco, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the leak to appear to be coming from a weld seam inward of the tank cradle.  Hepaco representatives were able to slow the leak to a slight drip and placed a containment pool underneath to catch additional released product.  Arrangements have been made to transfer the load.  After the product is transferred the shipper will request an FRA Movement Approval to forward the defective railcar to a qualified repair facility.  Approximately 5 gallons were released from the container.

The trailer's dome lid was crushed open during the rollover spilling 4700 gallons of hydrochloric acid.  The duration of the release is estimated to be about 15 minutes.      Fortunately, the accident occured in a very rural area of Texas with no waterways nearby.  The vehicle slid into a ditch that runs parallel to the road. The spillage was contained by the ditch.    The spill was cleaned up by a professional environmental service.",This incident reinforced the importance of navigating any turn or curve slowly.  We immediately sent out a Safety Alert and additional safety training material.  Each branch of our company held a safety meeting to discuss this incident and proper driving techniques.    The rollover protection for the dome lid failed in this case.  Maybe the rollover protection for this particular trailer needs further investigating.

The crew left the area and as a precaution were taken to a local hospital for medical evaluation and examination. A chemical screening test and oxygen were administered to four BNSF employees. The employees were released with no medical prescriptions provided and incurred no lost work days.  BNSF contract responders arrived and initiated air monitoring and rail car inspections. Several rail cars were inspected to determine the chemical odor source. Inspections revealed UTLX 200142 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) to be the odor source. The valve protective housing cover was found partially open (not closed completely) and the intact security seal (TBS 299691) was looped through the chain of the unapplied housing retaining pin. The liquid line had a 3 inch aluminum male cam-lock fitting still attached in the valve riser which prevented full closure of the housing cover. The liquid valve was in the closed position, but its closure plug was not applied due to the cam-lock fitting in place. Product residue was found on the outside of the valve and around the valve's base. A small amount of product was visible and surrounded the stainless steel ball in the ball valve body. The cam-lock fitting was removed with some difficulty as some of its threads were galled. Once removed, the product inside the valve body was absorbed and wiped with shop towels. Spillage on the valve body and valve base was also wiped. The liquid valve's 3 inch closure plug threads were re-taped with PTFE (Teflon) sealing tape. This plug was applied and tool tightened. Also, the vapor valve's one inch closure plug was found to be hand tight with no sealing tape on its threads. This closure plug was removed, threads taped, reinserted and tool tightened. The housing covered was then closed and properly pinned with SRS seal numbered 00330 applied. Afterwards, no product odor from UTLX 200142 was detectable and response was concluded at 1430 hrs.

CSXT dispatched a CSXT response contractor, Young's Environmental Company, Inc. (YECI). YECI personnel found vapor leaks at the gauging device due to its packing gland nut not being suffficiently tight, and at the ""B"" end liquid line valve and its closure plug. YECI personnel made six full turns to the packing gland nut to stop the vapor release at the gauging device, and advised that, although the ""B"" end liquid line valve was fully closed and its plug tool tight, vapor passed between the two. The leak was stopped by removing the valve plug, wrapping it in teflon tape and tool tightening it into the valve. CSXT advised shipper personnel (Mr. Jeff Angle) that they must obtain FRA Movement Approval for GATX 14360 to continue in transportation or make repairs in accord with all U. S. DOT Regulations.

The car was isolated and the area of the yard was vacated.  The shipper, BRENNTAG Mid South and Consignee, PPG Industries, were notified of the incident, and local, State and Federal notifications were made.  A CSXT contractor was dispatched to the scene.  The CSXT contractor was placed in a backup role by local public agency incident command, and a response team from Marathon (Greenup, KY) made entry to the car and stopped the leak by turning all four valves at least one turn each.  Marathon reported that the plugs were tight.    A CSXT seal was placed on the protective housing, and the car was held for PPG Industries to inspect before leaving for destination.

The driver immedialtey stopped the loading operation and utilized available containment equipment to contain the release.  Facility personnel were notified and a suitable absorbant material was used to absorb the free liquid.  In addition, an emergncy response crew was dispatched to the scene and all spill debris was collected and placed in suitable containers.  the side of the cargo tank was cleaned and all debris used in this cleaning operation were containerized for diosposal.

The pallets were stacked three high and the bottom container leaked from the cap.There was about 3 oz of material that leacked from the container. We recouped the entier pallet onto a new pallet and placed the one container that was leaking into a salvage drum. When this was discovered I contacted our manager of Saftey Don Andersen to advise him of the situation and to get his clean up instructions. There are no holes in the container just the leak from the cap. The leaking container is upright inside a salvage drum sitting in the OS&D bay.",Shipment could have been protected better in transit. This was a direct cause of improper blocking and bracing. The driver did use two empty pallets to fill the space between the two pallets but there was still room for the shipment to move.

The driver suffered a fractured rib and was airlifted to a hospital as a precautionary measure. He was released the same day.    On the truck, the meter head was broken off, and approximately ten gallons of propane vapor was released from the associated piping.  The duration of the release was approximately ten to fifteen minutes.  All of the automatic safety valves shut down, and there were no other leaks or spills.  The tank was not damaged.    The fire department sprayed water on the truck to disperse the propane leak.  Sunshine Propane employees shut off all of the manual valves and disconnected the truck battery.

Upon further inspection, it was found the innner metal drums were not sealed to HMR requirements (all inner seals were removed) allowing contents to spill easily.  The containers that were soaked (kerosene) were allowed to air out and were disposed of properly.","Being as it was a combination package, we had no idea of the inner package condition until it leaked.  I did have a discussion with the offerer from BRW though and went over with her what to look for in a properly sealed container.

The first incident was byDSR J. Gentilly, who was moving the shipment down the dock on top of a pallet of freight from another shipment.Upon crossing an expansion joint in the dock one carton of the damaged shipment (pro 722-009971) fell on the dock,causing the lids of the pails to be bent and come loose, allowing the product to be released. DSR J. Gentillyproceeded to put speedy dry on spill and clean up, placing damaged carton and pails into a recovery drum with plastic liner, which was subsequently placed in the OS&D area of the dock. Release was limited to approximately10-15 minutes, allowing maybe 1 gallon of product to be spilled. This incident happened at 0115 on 09/29/2008.The second carton of shipment 722-009971 was damaged at approximately 0400 by DSR A. Rocha who was loading another shipment onto a P/D route trailer. A. Rocha placed the carton (722-009971) on top of the pallet he was loading, when he backed out of the trailer the carton fell causing the lids of the pails to be bent and come loose allowing the product to be released. DSR A. Rocha proceeded to put speedy dry on the spill, put the damaged carton and pails into the same recovery drum, and clean up the speedy dry. Release was approximately 1/2 gallon within about a 10 minute time frame.Pictures were taken and uploaded to the Con-way website.","DSR'S ARE TO BE RETRAINED CONCERNING FORKLIFT/HAZ-MAT OPERATION AND HANDLING, ADDITIONALLY LETTERS OF INSTRUCTION WILL BE ISSURED TO BOTH DSR'S.",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CON-WAY FREIGHT,US,

Location: American Electric Power, Materials Facility, Bridgrnan MI. 49106:  Description of Events provided by ThermoFisher:  Normally all shipments of this product are shipped direct from our facility in Germany to our customers. As a result, the Oakwood Village, OH facility has not been a point of distribution for this product.  The DAI-6CC units were returned to the Thermo Fisher Scientific Oakwood Village, Ohio facility as a new product retum from a customer. The individual units were returned, packaged in unmarked fiberboard boxes. This is being addressed separately with this customer as a preventative action.  American Electric Power requested that the sources be removed from the product and sent to a separate address. Our customer service personnel generated a separate order for the shipment  the radioactive sources once they were removed from the DA1-6CC units. Reference customer order CO 130017.  The DA1-6CC units were pulled from stock and sent to the shipping department. Shipping personnel followed the notation on the order which indicated that the sources should be removed. The shipping personnel made the assumption that the sources were removed since there was no indication of the product being radioactive on the packaging as described above. Items were then mistakenly packaged and shipped as non haz-mat material.  Description of Events provided by American Electric Power:  On 09/19/08, the (2) area monitors were delivered to the AEP Materials Management Facility. The package was inspected and due to the waybill, the package was not inspected for radioactive material since the bill of lading stated that the sources were to be shipped separately to the DC Cook nuclear plant. The packages were then transported to the DC Cook nuclear plant where they were received onsite and custody transferred to the Radiation Protection Department (organization that ordered the items). When the packages were opened for inspection, the area monitors were to contain Sr-90 check sources (2 total). The Radiation Protection Department immediately quarrentined the area monitors, removed the Iwo check sources, then returned the area monitors to the materials management department for storage until the issue is resolved. Both check sources that were removed and placed in a secured radioactive material storage area.  A condition report was immediately generated and routed through the Environmental Department for review.","Corrective Actions Initiated by ThermoFisher:All packaging has been labeled as radioactive.Change relevant part descriptions to include the word ""radioactive"".Improve current work instructions to reflect a verification process for radioactive shipments.Provide additional training of all personnel involved in radioactive shipments.Work order will be submitted to investigate and implement an enhancement to the MRP system to flag or notify shipping personnel of radioactive items and shipments.Corrective Actions Initiated by American Electric Power:AEP Material Management Department has placed a hold on all ThermoFisher outstanding purchase orders.Determine actions necessary to ensure we receive radioactive shipments from ThermoFisher that are properly packaged, marked, and labeled (assignment due 45 days).",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

Occupants were asked to leave from the houses either side of the damaged building.  The trailer subframe (suspension) was torn from the trailer and as a result the piping adjacent to the subframe was damaged and a leak occured.  Much of the insulationn of the cargo tank was torn off during the accident and the trailer was building pressure, but venting properly as desgned to maintain pressuresat acceptable levels.   The trailer had a slow release of CO2 for approximately 4 hours when it was decided that to upright the damaged tank, it would be best that all product be vented from the trailer.  It was not possible to attempt a transfer of the product due to the severity of damage.  The trailer was blown down to atmosphere and uprighted, then removed from the scene.     The driver sustained a lunbar strain and broken nose and was treated and released form the local hospital.",Linde has implemented a fatigue awareness traiing program to address the impact of fatigue when driving.

Mr. Chatburn was pulling up to the main entrance/exit gate accessing Moore Street, when he heard a loud pop and viewed a subsequent vapor cloud on transfer track # 1, engulfing the spotted Acrylamide tank cars residing on the aforementioned track.  Mr. Chatburn, immediately returned to the office to obtain the product specific MSDS, activate the terminal’s emergency response plan and check on Ops Supervisor - James Houser who was closing up the silo transfer area.      At Approximately 6:48 PM, Mr. Chatburn radioed Ops Supervisor Mr. James Houser who was at the Soda Ash Silo System, notifying him of a vapor cloud originating from  Flocryl Acrylamide tank car GATX 70680 staged on track #1.  Mr. Chatburn instructed Mr. Houser to be mindful of the wind direction when attempting to return to the office in order to assist with internal company, external incident notifications.  Mr. Chatburn then proceeded to contact, 911 to report that a hazardous material incident (e.g., Acrylamide vapor release) was transpiring at the TRANSFLO - Philadelphia facility located at South 36th & Moore Streets in Philadelphia, PA (Grays Ferry) and he requires their assistance.      At approximately 6:50 PM, Mr. Chatburn contacted Savage’s General Manager - Randy Gifford to inform him that a hazardous material incident was presently occurring with vapor discharging from an Acrylamide tank car at the TRANSFLO - Philadelphia, PA terminal; Mr. Chatburn indicated to Mr. Gifford that he was about to leave from the facility when he heard a loud pop and a cloud formed on track # 1 engulfing the spotted Acrylamide tank cars.  Mr. Gifford encouraged Mr. Chatburn to contact Chemtrec and activate the terminal’s emergency response plan, and contact the shipper if he had not already done so at the present time.  Mr. Gifford made proceeding notification phone calls to TRANSFLO’s Manager of Field Operations - Marc Scena (left voice message on his cell) and conversed with Savage’s Director of SH&E - Rich Stanley describing the hazmat incident scenario transpiring at the TRANSFLO - Philadelphia, PA location.  Mr. Stanley proceeded to notify TRANSFLO’s Director of HSE&Q - Ms. Jan Barnes of the aforementioned event; Mr. Stanley indicated that he was in the Philadelphia area and could be on the scene in roughly an hour.      Mr. Chatburn then proceeded to contact Chemtrec to provide a verbal report of the hazardous material vapor release originating from Flocryl Acrylamide tank car GATX 70680 and solicit their advice and assistance; the following Chemtrec report number was assigned, Chemtrec report # 2008092600177.  Chemtrec also forwarded Mr. Chatburn onto Flocryl’s John Hennesy; Mr. Chatburn then described the above incident scenario to Mr. Hennesy and informed him that he was","Corrective Action(s)  ¿ Unable to be determined at this point in time as the entities (Savage; TRANSFLO; CSX; Flocryl) do not know the apparent cause of the product polymerizing inside tank car GATX 70680.

REGULATORY AFFAIRS,2100 COMMONWEALTH AVE,NORTH CHICAGO,IL,60064,Carrier,"The common camer driver (not an EMCO/company employee) took it upon himself to replace a gasket a the rear of the tanker and inside the external valve as that valve showed signs of leaking. After finishing the gasket installation, evidently the gasket was not properly/correctly seated, so the valve didn’t sit flush. The driver first opened the internal/safety valve, and then when the driver opened the external valve, product began to spray out in various directions at once, causing the chemical to contact the driver from head-to-foot. The chemical on the ground caused the driver to slip and fall, hitting his head on the ground. The driver got up and first closed the external vilve and then closed the internal/safety valve. An EMCO employee who saw what had happened escorted the driver to an on-site shower facility, where he removed his clothes and took a thorough shower. He was provided with disposable garments by EMCO. Once it was discovered the employee had gotten chemical on himself, the North Chicago EMS was called and responded to the incident and after evaluating the driver, took him to the local hospital, along with a copy of the spilled chemical’s MSDS.  All of the released material was contained on-site, above ground, inside a diked area. EMCO’s on-site HazMat Team was deployed to thoroughly remove/clean up the spill, along with removing chemical from the rear of the tanker, which was also inside the diked containment area. Absorbent pads were first used to absorb the spilled material and then the area and vehicle was wiped down with an isopropanol/ammonia/water solution as specified on tie MSDS.  Once the driver was released from the hospital, he returned to EMCO and checked his vehicle prior to leaving the facility.","The common carrier driver should have informed someone at IMCO that he was attempting to fix/replace the external valve gasket. We had no idea the driver was doing this; he was doing it without our knowledge cc permission. If he had informed someone at EMCO, we would have had one of our maintenance employees make the repair and/or assist the driver when replacing the gasket and then test the gasket replacement under controlled conditions to make sure product was not released on any individual or the ground. Ideally, the repair should have been performed while the tanker was empty.  in addition, the same driver had been at our facility approximately two weeks earlier with the same tanker and the driver was notified at that time the external valve had a very minor leak (we placed a bucket under the valve at that time to collect any material that dripped out) and that it should be repaired before the tanker returns to our facility.  The carrier was notified about the incident and the driver was informed he cannot make any repairs to his vehicle (tractor, tanker, etc.) without our expressed permission first and proper supervision during the repair by ore of our qualified employees.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"EMCO CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTORS, INC",US,

HOWEVER, WHEN FACILITY PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE SUNDAY MORNING, THEY OBSERVED THAT THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE HAD POPPED OPEN AND THAT THE TANK CONTENTS WERE VERY HOT.  A CHEMICAL REACTION HAD STARTED CAUSING THE WASTE TO BOIL.  SOME LIQUID MATERIAL SPRAYED OUT OF THE TANKER ONTO NEARBY EQUIPMENT WHEN THE RELIEF VALVE OPENED.  EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FROM THE CITY OF GARLAND FIRE DEPARTMENT AND DALLAS HAZ-MAT TEAM CAME TO THE FACILITY TO REVIEW THE SITUATION.  THEY ORDERED A TEMPORARY EVACUATION OF THE ASHLAND FACILITY AND NEARBY BUILDINGS.  AFTER OBSERVING THE REACTION AND CONDITION OF THE TANKER, THEY DECIDED THAT THERE WAS NO LONGER A DANGER OF AN EXPLOSION AND ALLOWED EMPLOYEES TO RETURN TO THEIR RESPECTIVE BUILDINGS.  THE RESPONSE TEAMS RECOMMEND THAT THE MATERIAL BE ALLOWED TO COMPLETE ITS REACTION AND COOL PRIOR TO MOVING THE TANK WAGON.  ON OCTOBER 8, 2008, THE WASTE HAD FINALLY COMPLETED IT REACTION AND COOLED.  DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGE TO THE TANK WAGON, THE WASTE WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER TANK WAGON AND TAKEN FOR DISPOSAL.","TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN, ASHLAND HAS WORKED WITH THE CUSTOMER TO ENSURE WASTE STREAMS ARE NOT MIXED PRIOR TO PICK UP.
