The caller was very unsure of a lot. She estimated that approximately 1 quart of UN1263, Paint (flammable), 3, PGII ""Zinsser BIN Primer"" had released from at least 1 (1) quart metal pail inside of a box with 6 quarts total. She wasn't sure exactly what product this was on the BOL sent over which had a list with many products on it. None of the products had a UN number on it but when locating the SDS for the trade name of the picture sent over, it was declared hazardous. She said that a box containing (2) 1-gallon metal cans of a non regulated primer were also at the very least impacted and maybe damaged. She stated that the UN1263 paint had released to the trailer floor of trailer 3175454, but the trailer was never cleaned up and had already left the terminal.

I requested that he check with the truck stop staff to see if they had a barrier they could put around the vehicle to contain the leak to the immediate area while I worked on getting a hazmat response agency on-site. The truck stop did not have a barrier so they contacted the Greenup Fire department that arrived with a barrier and they waited in the area until the hazmat response team arrived.  The hazmat agency immediately discovered one leaking drum that had a structural failure near the base. They cleaned the interior of the truck as best they could on-site as well as the involved pavement area in the truck stop parking lot. The agency requested that the driver return to their shop for additional cleaning so they could remove all the freight since the failed drum was located in the nose of the box. The hazmat agency was on-site at the truck stop for approximately 2 hours.  After arriving at their site and moving the freight they discovered a second leaking drum caused by a nail protruding up from the skid into the bottom of the barrel. All freight was removed from the vehicle, it was cleaned, the partially filled drum was placed in an overpack for disposal, and all waste held for disposal by our hazmat agent.","When the parent company of the consignee, Chemours, was notified of the leak they indicated that the freight was likely to be leaking and that the shipment had been set up to return the freight.

As a result the drum fell over and struck the pallet it was staged on which slightly punctured the drum and contributed to the unintentional release. The spilled product was cleaned with absorbent and placed into a recovery container. The punctured drum was laid on its side, secured, and repair with drum putty and successful returned to terminal where it was placed into a recovery container and eventually delivered to ultimate consignee without further incident.",The only suggestion I can come up with regarding this event is to make sure the pallets chosen and used to staged drums on can support the weight of the drum and will not crack and collapse like it did in this event.

It was raining at this time. He reported the situation to his terminal manager. Shortly after contacting his manager someone at the truck stop contacted Atlanta Fire department. On arrival they examined the trailer and reported acid was leaking around the dome area. An emergency response contractor was brought in to collect and clean the leaking material. No lined cargo tank trailer was available to transfer the acid into so the contractor transferred the acid into intermediate bulk containers. The trailer continued to leak while this process was conducted. After completing the material transfer the contractor cleaned the area. The acid in the ibc's continued to it's original destination.  It appears there was a failure of the cargo tank lining which allowed hydrocloric acid to contact the stainless steel tank shell resulting in hole in the cargo tank shell.",Provide additional training to material handlers to ensure that they are implementing proper freight handling techniques and are able to recognize and prevent potential future incidents.,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,109957,,,

Driver pulled over immediately to check his load and found a pallet of  drums had shifted resulting in a puncture of one drum approximately 1/4 of the way down from the  top of the drum.  The driver called our internal emergency response hotline, the Elko Fire Department, and Nevada  Highway Patrol.  Due to the drum contents, flammable material, the Elko Fire Department  evacuated 2 small business nearby.  The Fire Department HazMat team used an air monitoring  device and determined there was no danger.  Evacuation was cancelled.

As the driver attempted to bring the truck back onto the road, it crossed the road again, this time to the right side, where the driver over-corrected to the left, causing the truck to turn over on its right side. Approximately 2400 gallons of methanol was released into a swale adjacent to roadway, due to the abrasion and rupture of several tank compartments, as well as failure/leaking of product from top hatches. Initial estimates were a release rate of 10 gpm or so; however, this slowed considerably as liquid levels fell below top hatches. Cuero VFD and state troopers closed FM 766 as a precaution and attempted to place booms to slow advance of methanol but tall grass prevented effective response. Victoria FD Regional Hazmat and CG Environmental (private spill response contractor) were dispatched to scene and arrived by 14:00, at which point tanker no longer leaking, and liquid level below hatches. RSI personnel from Cuero Yard were dispatched to scene with a flatbed, empty IBC's (totes), and a pump and remaining product (approximately 525 gallons) off-loaded into totes and truck righted by 19:00. A Texas Commission of Environmental Quality (TCEQ) Region 14 (Corpus Christi) investigator supervised response actions and follow-up sampling of soils in vicinity of spill; results were indicative of no impact. It is speculated that due to prevailing wind and weather conditions during the incident, the vast majority of released product volatilized into the atmosphere. Some distressed vegetation was observed in the vicinity of the rollover in the days following the incident. No water bodies (e.g. Guadalupe River) were impacted as a result of the incident.","RSI has communicated the details of this incident company-wide and reviewed its operating policies and procedures with drivers; specifically, the need to be abreast of changes in medical status and medicine dosages.  In this case, the driver was impaired due to taking a higher than recommended dose of a required medication - the dose had changed but the driver had forgotten and inadvertently took twice the recommended dose. In addition, the driver complained of fatigue and had been evaluated for a sleep disorder.  This information fell outside the scope of the normal DOT physical and so was not disclosed to RSI, according to the post-incident investigation.

Driver did not have extra packing material which fixes most common issues with this part of the valve.   5 Knowing the leak was secure for transport (just not for offloading) the driver left the consignee to go and get the problem fixed    6 Driver claims he completed a pre-trip to include a dome lid check to ensure it was secure    7 As driver exited the plant on to Market street, the product began to spill, impacting approximately 500 feet of roadway.    8 Driver noted he heard a rushing sound, and something didn’t sound right and then noticed product coming from the trailer in his mirrors.     9 Driver stopped, got out, realized product was coming down the rainwater drain tubes from the crash box and had spilled on to the roadway.   10  In his hurry to secure the spill, he attempted to plug the drain tubes to contain it, and did not Don his required PPE.    11 Despite successfully plugging the drain tubes, product got on driver’s arms and legs   12 Driver checked the top of trailer, claims everything was secure and has no idea how the product released    13 As verified by spill response company, 75 gallons spilled in total from within the plant to the roadway where driver stopped   14 Spill response company verified all up top was secure when they got to the scene    15 A fire department chief witnessed the driver pull over and pulled behind him to assist. Driver stated his legs and arms had a burning sensation    16 Fire Department Chief called an ambulance who set up a portable decontamination station and rinsed driver with water. Transported him to the hosptial for evaluation. Driver was given hydrocortisone/aquaphorine as treatment and released   17 The tractor/trailer were staged at the consignee lot, as it was in close proximity. A Schneider Safety Team associate went to the consignee location and identified the source of the initial unload problem. During the last clean out, the tankwash disassembled the QRB, cleaned it and reassembled, but the crunch ring used to apply pressure on the Teflon packing material was put on backwards in error by the Tankwash facility.    18 The safety team corrected the issue on site, and the load was safely unloaded without further incident",,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

No storm drains or waterways were reported to be impacted by the release. There were no fires, threats of fires, evacuations or threats of evacuations. On April 26, 2019 at approximately 1700 ET, Ace Environmental personnel arrived on scene to contain and clean the release. Upon arrival, a mini-excavator and skid steer were utilized to recover the hazardous waste material in the impacted area, that measured approximately 30-feet (ft.) x 80-ft. The recovered material was direct-loaded into three, 25-yard roll-off containers and transported off-site by Ace to their facility pending transportation and delivery to generator (i.e., Maryland DOT Port Administration).

Pryor Management confirmed with police that this was ok.,The valve was replaced.  Training was held with all drivers to reinforce that all valves should be hand tightened (per design) rather than using a valve wrench on them.  We will follow-up to ensure training and procedures specifically state valves designed for hand tightening should never be tightened with valve wrenches.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC.",US,

He then flushed his lines and began the delivery to the hydrochloric acid tank.  During the delivery to the hydrochloric acid tank the driver mistakenly placed the pump into the wrong IBC and pumped approximately 30 gallons of sodium hypochlorite solution into the  hydrochloric acid tank.  This mixture released approximately 30lbs of chlorine gas into the atmosphere.  There was a water aerobics class and other users in the pool adjacent to the chemical storage room where the accidental mixing took place.  Approximately 24 persons and our employee in the pool area were transported to the hospital.

Our drivers are not allowed to assist with the loading.  After the loading was completed the operator failed to close the belly valves.  While exiting the facility our driver hit a fence post, tearing and dislodging the belly pipes from the tanker.  Due to the belly valves not being closed the spill occurred.  The driver re-positioned the tanker to gain access to close the belly valves, mitigating the amount spilled.  Approximately 1804 gallons spilled on to an asphalt lot and drained to a dirt gravel lot.  95% of the product evaporated.  The fire department was called they evacuated the facility.  After approximately 2 hours the vast majority of the spill had evaporated and they deemed the area safe to return.  HEPACO (an environmental response company) responded and proceeded to clean up the remaining residue utilizing a vac truck.  Over the next three days HEPACO removed and properly disposed of all the contaminated soil and replaced with new gravel and soil.  Petroleum Carriers pumped off the remaining product into another tanker and proceeded to deliver to the customer.",We feel the biggest lesson learned from this incident was to insure all belly valves are closed after loading and during transit.  The second lesson was even though this was seasoned driver we felt all our employees needed re-training on the purpose and location of the emergency shut off.  Petroleum Carriers have re-evaluated our procedures in both areas and re-educated our employees on the significance of both lessons learned.  We also have reached out to RSI to evaluate their procedures to insure the belly valves are closed after loading and to give our driver access to see that consignee.
