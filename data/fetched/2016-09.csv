First Street,Elizabeth,NJ,07206,Carrier,"On September 15th 2016 in the evening Michael Raback was preparing to leave Cycle Chem Inc. located at 550 Industrial Drive Lewisberry PA  17339 , phone number (717) 938-4700 with a tanker of Flammable Waste to be disposed of at ROSS Incineration Inc. in Grafton Ohio. During Michael’s preparation he moved the tanker from the facility to the drop lot located at 621 Lowther Road Lewisberry PA. to address a flat tire and retrieve supplies. In doing so Michael did not check the dome on the tanker to ensure that it was properly secured.  The dome was not secured and during the move from Industrial Drive to Lowther Road an estimated 183 gallons spilled onto the road way and the drive way.  The spill was not reported until the following morning September 16th 2016 at around 9am to my office. The area traveled by Raback was checked and a spill was discovered in the area of 631 Lowther Rd.   At this time Cycle Chem Inc. mobilized a crew and cleaned up the locations that the material had spilled onto generating one drum of waste weighing an estimated 124 pounds.  The locations were found because of a dark stain left on the pavement from the material spilling onto the ground. There does not appear to be any contamination of land, water or air but the affected area will have samples taken by All State power vac and remediation completed if needed.   I will be terminating the driver Michael Rabacks employment.  It is company policy to complete a full Pre Trip inspection of both tractor and trailer before moving any asset. Clean Venture Inc. also has a policy to report any spill immediately to a supervisor or manager as soon as it happens. Neither of these policies were followed by the driver. A training session will be conducted for all Clean Venture drivers to review this incident and the policy(s) that were violated.",A training session will be conducted for all Clean Venture drivers to review this incident and the policy(s) that were violated.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,2100,ACVenviro,US,

When driver recovered from sneezing he drifted to the right edge of the roadway.  He was a lead trailer with a pup trailer attached to the lead trailer.  Both tank trailers were hauling diesel fuel.  When driver noticed the pup trailer caught the edge of the road embankment and was tipping on it's side, he could not recover  the pup trailer and it rolled over on it's right side and was dragging.  Driver stopped immediately and noticed the pup trailer had breached it's compartment and was leaking diesel fuel.  Fuel lost was approximately 3300 gals.  Release duration was approximately 1 hour.  Construction equipment nearby immediately put dirt on the fuel to absorb it.  Our environmental response team finished the clean-up.",Driver has many years of experience driving tanker trucks and doubles and triples.  This incident is the result of unfortunate circumstances that resulted from a sneezing fit caused by sun glare.  Driver was not on phone or otherwise distracted.

The driver stated that the drum released approximately 3 ounces of material to the trailer floor when the drum was being moved with a pallet jack.  The drum would only leak when pressure was applied to the bottom of the drum via the pallet jack.  The damaged drum released approximately 3 ounces of material to the trailer floor.  NO soils, drains or waterways were impacted by the release.  Air Force Base personnel over packed the damaged drum and cleaned the impacted area.

One of the drums leaked approximately 1/2 cup of material to the trailer floor. Prior to calling ERTS, terminal workers placed the drums on a new skid in the upright position. The SDS was forwarded to the terminal for their reference. The state was notified of the release and Operator 209 provided report number 2016-5286. There were no drains or waterways impacted by this release. The RQ for this release is 1000 pounds. With only a 1/2 cup release, RQ will not be reached.

The car was also noted as being in a Bad Order status and was being returned to UTLX for Home Shop repairs.   The contractor did comment that the BOV cap and plug were tool tight and the drip was coming from the packing nut on the BOV handle. The manway was opened up and it was noted that there was no product left in the tank itself. The contractor removed the BOV cap, drained the residual that was contained within the BOV and cap assembly, and reinstalled the cap tool tight.

One of the DOT 412 trailers dome lids was not properly secured prior to transport causing the release of approximately 5 gallons of material to a 3 mile stretch of Silver Lake Road.  Once the driver noticed there was a release he pulled to the side of the road where he properly secured the dome lid.  There were no drains, soils or waterways impacted by the release.  There were no road closures or injuries due to the release.  An environmental contractor was dispatched to clean the roadway and collect all free product.  By the time the contractor arrived on site the material had dried into a powder on the road.  The contractor utilized a street sweeper to clean the impacted area of roadway and collect all free product.  All free product was captured with the street sweeper and all waste was collected into a 55 gallon poly drum and taken offsite for disposal.  The trailer was secured and inspected and determined to be in safe condition to continue with out any further release.",,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2500,Emergency Response and Training Solutions,US,

The tank was transported with no product release,  to storage yard at approximately 10:45 AM.  A yard check was completed at 11:45 AM and the ISO tank was not leaking at that time.  At 14:33 PM a Superior Carriers driver passed by the ISO and noticed product leaking from the sealed crash box. The storage personnel cut the wire seals and noticed the ball valve in the open position and the loading flange, not attached. The storage personnel closed the valve, and tightened the loading flange, stopping the product from releasing.  Akzo Nobel loading personnel did not close the ball valve or tighten the loading flange, prior to sealing the crash box with metal seals.  The ISO tank, after sitting in the heat several hours, began to build pressure and pressure pushed the product out of the open valve and flange, filling the crash box and spill damn, located on top of the ISO tank and then began to spill onto the tank and ground.  The product drained into the swampy area behind where the ISO tank was parked at the trucking terminal, storage yard.       Akzo Nobel  was notified and the shipper called a crew out to build a sand dike or berm around the area where the product release occurred. The shipper's crew vacuumed out the water in the diked area and treated the contained area with 250 gallons of 4% hydrogen peroxide.  Soil samples were taken and came back inconclusive.  The shipper's crew again vacuumed more water out of the area and treated the area with more hydrogen peroxide.

Upon exiting the tractor, the driver conducted an inspection of the trailer and its contents and did not find any issues.  At 17:00, the driver exited the tractor again and noticed a small amount of liquid on one of the tractor tires.  The driver then inspected the outside of the trailer and noticed a small amount of liquid inside the trailer.  The driver called the corporate office and was instructed to place absorbent pads under the area of the leak to contain the material leaking from the trailer.  Our driver then notified the manager of the Pilot rest stop who then called the Austinburg Fire Department.","In order to prevent any similar events, it is imperative that the appropriate shipping container be selected at the time of generation.  It appears by all evidence that this release occurred because the waste material was incompatible with the container type.  The waste was corrosive in nature and overtime caused a hole to form near the bottom of the container, which lead to the release.      The leaked material had been placed in a steel (A1A) closed head container.  Based on the corrosive nature of this mixture, a polyethylene container or a steel container with a polyethylene liner would have been a more appropriate choice for transport.  It appears that a combination of events: corrosion and chemical reaction, resulted in the pencil lead sized failure of the container allowing the contents to spill out.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,16685,Triumvirate Environmental,US,

The material inside of the tote is unknown, however the driver advised he will send pictures to ERTS to determine this. The tote was crushed but has not released any material. The driver, Melissa, is reporting that the tote needs transferred to an undamaged tote. 1500ET ERTS contacted network contractor, NRC, who provided an ETA of 1700 ET. No regulatory reporting is required at this time. ERTS will attempt to locate the SDS once the material is identified. Contractor reports that this cleanup is complete and the trailer is back on the road. The product was transferred into a new tote and the tote was staged back on the trailer. The damaged tote was taken off site for disposal as non RCRA empty. No additional waste was generated.

Roscoe Compton from Martin Product Sales was notified and approved the response and clean up by M&M Protection.  M&M Protection responded to the scene and found product leaking from the flange on the liquid line.  Once pressure was released from the car the leak stopped however the liquid line flange bolts were fused and could not be removed. PTRA determined the best solution was to move the car to customer track, Westway Terminal, approximately 1/4 mile under 49CFR Part 174.50 for unloading and repair. The car was spotted at approximately  0130 hours on September 17.",Martin Product Sales was notified of the leak at the time of the incident.

One of the Mechanical Carmen who reported GATX 32206 leaking indicated difficulty breathing and sought medical attention, so he was transported to a local hospital for examination and released with no medical treatment.  GATX 32206 was ultimately transloaded and cleaned for further disposition.",GATX 32206 was due for a liner inspection in 2017.

The pallet was then secured in the cargo bay by straps and transported to Lynden Pindling International Airport in Nassau, Bahamas.    During the supervised off-loading procedure at Odyssey Aviation, ground personnel with the use of a forklift were removing the pallet from the aircraft when the fiberboard packaging gave way causing two of the hidden gas cylinders to fall from the pallet and strike the ground.  Neither cylinder discharged.    At the flight crews instruction, no further attempt was made to remove the pallet from the aircraft.  Ground personnel were instructed to remove the remaining cylinders by hand, one by one, and place them on a another pallet on the ground.  During this process, another portion of the packaging gave way, causing one more cylinder to fall from the pallet and strike the ground.  This cylinder did discharge.    No individual on the ground suffered any injury or effect from this occurrence and the discharge dissipated into the atmosphere.","As the shipment was hidden and not declared as dangerous goods, no specific changes to current procedures are warranted.

Chemical Helpline was contacted for assistance; Patriot Environmental was dispatched to remediate the leak at the facility.     Patriot Environmental determined leaking product was a 1/2 gallon of the UN3264* material listed on the waybill. The leak originated from one (1) of the three (3) 15 gallon drums poorly secured with two strips of stretch wrap at the rear; straps utilized to keep the pallet in place were loose. Patriot staff neutralized product and cleaned the floor as well as the exterior of the trailer. The 15 gallon drum was over-packed into a 55 gallon drum for transit to the nearest FedEx Freight facility. New seal number applied was 2449047.     *The material was labeled in FXFZ 974561 as UN1824 (Sodium Hydroxide solution).

The released acid dripped onto a UPRR switchmans head, hands, arms and leg causing chemical burns.      Inspection of the tank car found approximately five to ten gallons of product had splashed across the top of the tank car and run down the sides of the car in some spots.  Further inspection found the pressure plate/ fixed manway cover plate gasket out of position on the B-end of the tank car.  The gasket was hanging out between the tank car nozzle and the manway cover plate.  In addition, two of twelve manway cover plate securement bolts (on the same end as the gasket was displaced) were slightly less than tool tight.      There was no evidence of a release from the fill port or frangible disk housing.  The fill port gasket was visually checked from the side and determined to be in position.     Haz-Mat Response (Contractor) responded and decontaminated the ground and tank car with approximately fifty gallons of soda ash/water solution.
