AS OPERATORS WERE UNLOADING THE CONTAINERS, LIQUID WAS SEEN ON THE TRAILER BED NEAR CONTAINER NUMBER 55419-01, A B-25 BOX CONTAINING PLASTIC DEBRIS, AND SIGNS OF CORROSION WERE NOTED NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX.  RADIOLOGICAL SURVEYS INDICATED CONTAMINATION OUTSIDE THE CONTAINER AT <220 DISINTEGRATION PER MINUTE PER CENTIMETER SQUARED (DPM/CM2) FROM A BETA/GAMMA SURVEY.  DETECTABLE LEVELS OF RADIOLOGICAL CONTAMINATION WERE FOUND ON THE TRAILER BED AND ON AN ADJACENT CONTAINER.  THE OTHER CONTAINERS WERE REMOVED FROM THE TRUCK LEAVING THE BREACHED CONTAINER IN PLACE.  THE AREA WAS THEN SECURED BY HANFORD WASTE OPERATIONS.  ON OCTOBER 2,  THE TRAILER WAS DECONTAMINATED AND RELEASED TO THE OWNER. A TOTAL OF 40 CONTAINERS OF PGDP DOE LLW GENERATED DURING THE C-746 Q DRUM RUPTURE INCIDENT WERE APPROVED FOR DISPOSAL OF HANFORD.  THE SHIPMENT CONSISTED OF FOUR FLAT BED TRUCKS THAT LEFT PGDP BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 24, 1998 WITH THE LAST TRUCK LEAVING ON SEPTEMBER 28, 1998.  ALL TRUCKS HAD ARRIVED AT HANFORD BY OCTOBER 1, 1998.  THE CONTAINER CONSIST OF STABILIZED ACIDIC WASTE AND SECONDARY DEBRIS.  RADIOLOGICAL SURVEYS AND INSPECTIONS OF THE TRUCK AND CONTAINERS SHOWED NO BREACHES OR CONTAMINATION UPON RELEASE FROM PGDP.  THE CONTAINER THAT IS BREACHED IS A B-25 LSA STRONG TIGHT CONTAINER.  THE CONTENTS OF THE BREACHED CONTAINER CONSIST OF USED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, PLASTIC DEBRIS, AND CUT UP PLASTIC DRUM LINERS.  THE CONTAINER HAS A LAYER OF PLASTIC SHEETING COVERING THE INSIDE SURFACE.  IN ADDITION, ALL WASTE WAS PLACED IN RADIOLOGICAL BAGS PRIOR TO CONTAINERIZING. NO FREE LIQUIDS WERE PRESENT WHEN THE WASTE WAS CONTAINERIZED. RADIOLOGICAL DATA TAKEN BY HANFORD SOLD WASTE PERSONNEL FROM THE TRUCK TRAILER AND BREACHED CONTAINER INDICATE THAT THE CONTAMINATION LEVELS ARE UNDER LIMITS ALLOWED BY 49 CFR TRANSPORTATION REGULATIONS.  PADUCAH PROJECT'S BECHTEL JACOBS COMPANY RADIOLOGICAL PROTECTION MANAGER VERIFIED DATA.  CONTRIBUTION WAS LIMITED TO SMALL AREA ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BREACHED CONTAINER,  THE TOP OF THE TRAILER BED, AND ANOTHER BOX.

WHILE JIM WAS DRIVING ENROUTE TO THE DANBURY STATION ON RT. 25. THE INTERSECTION OF RT. 25 AND MILEHILL RD. HAD AN EMERGENCY DETOUR SET UP BY NEWTOWN  FIRE DEPT.  DUE TO AN EARLY AUTO ACCIDENT OF A LARGE UTILITY POLE WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO THE INTERSECTION AT APPROXIMATELY 9:00 P.M. UTILITY WIRES WERE LAYING ACROSS THE INTERSECTION WHICH MADE THE ROAD IMPASSABLE. JIM HAD TO FOLLOW A DESIGNATED ROUTE WHICH HAD BEEN SET UP BY LOCAL OFFICIALS WHICH HAD LEFT THE SCENE PRIOR TO JIM'S APPROACH DUE TO ANOTHER EMERGENCY CALL IN TOWN.  THE ONLY PERSONNEL AT THE TIME WERE UTILITY PERSONNEL IN THE AREA REINFORCING DOWN WIRES.  THERE WERE NO EMERGENCY PERSONNEL DIRECTING TRAFFIC, BUT CONES WERE SET UP IN A NARROW CURVED AREA DUE TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE ALREADY TAKING PLACE AT THE TIME OF JIM'S ACCIDENT.  JIM FOLLOWED THE OUTLINE FOR DETOUR VEHICLES AND WAS FORCED TO JUMP THE CURBING/GRASS AREA WITH HIS RIGHT TANDEMS SINCE HE COULD NOT TURN THE TRACTOR/TRAILER IN A WIDE PATTERN.  WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR THIS TYPE OF TURN.  JIM'S TANDEMS DROVE BY FOUR 2.5 TO 3 FOOT HIGH GUIDE POLES SET BACK APPROXIMATELY 4 FOOT WITH NO PROBLEM APPROXIMATELY 8-10 FOOT FROM THE FIRST SERIES OF GUIDE POLES.  A SECOND SET OF GUIDE POLES NEAR THE CURB LINE BEGAN THE FIRST POLE WAS CAMAFLOUGED WITH HIGH GRASS AND BRUSH.  THIS IS THE POLE WHICH SEVERED THE THREE MANIFOLD VALVES.  JIM FOLLOWED THE SUGGESTED ROUTE BY EMERGENCY PERSONNEL BUT COULD NOT MAKE THE TURN SINCE THE ROUTE WAS EXTREMELY NARROW.  THIS RESULTED IN A SPILL OF 18-20 GALLONS OF GASOLINE WHICH CAME FROM #2,#3 AND #4, MANIFOLDS SEVERED BY THE HARDWARE ON THE HIDDEN GUIDE POLE IN THE SHRUB. AFTER THE PRODUCT ESCAPED FROM THE MAINFOLDS IT IGNITED FROM A SPARK.  THE DRIVER SAW THE FLASH AND TOOK THE UNIT ABOUT 25 FOOT AWAY FROM THE FIRE FOR A SAFE HAVEN AND ABANDONED THE TRUCK SINCE HE WAS NOT SURE IF A TRAIL OF FIRE WAS FOLLOWING DOWN MILE HILL ROAD.   THE FIRE ALMOST EXTINGUISHED ITSELF BUT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY THE UTILITY PERSONNEL IN THE AREA.  THEY HAD BEEN IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA FOR A BANK ALARM.  THEY EXTINGUISHED SMOLDERING GUIDE POLE AND SHRUB/GRASSY AREA.
