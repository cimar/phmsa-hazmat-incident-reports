The tank car was switched into track 14 on the same day where it sat until it was discovered leaking on 10/6/2009 at approximately 1350 hrs. A PTRA switchman was riding a shove movement on track 15 past the leaking tank and observed the leak. He reported that the vapors from the leak made him dizzy and gave him a headache. He reported the leak to the yardmaster and trainmaster on duty. The employee was transported to a doctors office where he was observed and released. He was advised to take aspirin as necessary for his headache. No other restrictions or instructions were listed. The doctor did not release him for duty account the employee wanted a second opinion by his personal doctor on 10/7/09.  The PTRA safety Director arrived on scene at 1411 hrs. He notified M&M Protection Services to respond to the incident upon arrival. M&M arrived on scene at 1510 hrs.  Responders released the pressure on the tank and stopped the leak from the manway cover. Upon further investigation it was discovered that the car was overloaded and had a damaged/torn gasket. The product level was 1/4 inch from the top of the manway. The weather was approximately 92 degress and mostly sunny allowing the product to expand and leak out around the manway. A vacuum truck was ordered to transfer the product until a proper outage was reached in the tank car.  While waiting for the vacuum truck M&M had to allow the pressure to release on the tank car. In order to do so they had to maintain a controlled leak. Most of the product that ran down the sides of the car vaporized before hitting the ground. Product on the ground was soaked up using absorbent pads.  The vacuum truck arrived at approximately 1710 hrs. The leak was stopped as soon as the transfer began at approximately 1745 hrs. A total of 1500 gallons was transfered into the vac truck in order to acheive a 15-18 inch outage in the tank car. Upon completion a replacement gasket was applied to the manway and the car was closed and secured for transit to the customer.  The scene was cleared at 1840 hrs. An estimated 15 gallons of product was spilled from the tank. Any product that did not vaporize was soaked up by the absorbent pads. Both the pads and product in the tank truck will be disposed of properly by M&M Protection.,"PTRA is working with the TX Haz Mat inspector and the shipper to correct the problem and prevent similar issues in the future. We will discuss the shippers procedures to calculate the proper outage based on the temperature variations across the transportation route. Additionally, we will work with the shipper to ensure the tank car is properly sealed to avoid damage to the gasket and leakage of product.",No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3500,Port Terminal Railroad Association,US,

The spilled material was contained within the tank containment area. No one was exposed to or injured by the material. An estimated ten gallons of material was released.,This release was due to an error in plant procedure.  the night shift had was directed to pump down the storage tank to make way for the product delivery in the morning. the storage tank would not hold the amount shipped in this was not completed. The pump down did not occur and was not communicated to the operator assigned to service our driver. When the operator accepted the load he assumed the pump down occurred. the storage tank was only able to hold 90% shipped and overflowed.    The storage tank has no high level alarm system. the operator must visually inspect the level and the operator failed to do that prior the product transfer.

While at the Circle K Truck Stop in Opelika, Alabama, the driver discovered free product leaking from the back of the container.  The driver applied absorbent material to contain the free liquid on the impacted asphalt surface.  The Opelika Fire Department Hazmat Unit responded to assess the site.  After obtaining authorization to open the container doors, the Opelika Fire Department Hazmat Unit entered the container and applied absorbent material to contain the free liquid on the container floor.  Southern Waste Services of Birmingham, Alabama was dispatched to perform the remainder of the cleanup.  Southern Waste Services arrived on-site and performed a thorough investigation of the container.  Southern Waste Services discovered one (1) leaking 5-gallon metal pail.  Approximately 3 gallons of free product were released from the pail.  Apparently the release was due to faulty packaging.  Southern Waste Services placed the leaking pail into a 55-gallon recovery drum for disposal.  Southern Waste Services applied additional absorbent material as needed and recovered all spent absorbent material.  The spent absorbent material was placed into the 55-gallon drum containing the leaking pail.  No injuries or exposures were reported.","Since the release was accidental, no actions have been taken to prevent recurrence.

The car was isolated and the shipper was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2009-10-05-00097). Summit Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene by the shipper and found 4 of 8 manway bolts were loose and the manway gasket missing.

The car was isolated and the shipper was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2009-10-05-00203). Bill Caton and Chris Machenberg, CSXT hazardous materials managers, were dispatched to the scene and found the B-end liquid line leaking at the valve stem. The packing was adjusted and tightened and the product subsequently began leaking at the closure plug.  The plug was tool tight but lacked sealant material. Therefore, the car was transloaded into Tanner Industries trucks onsite. A vacuum was drawn on the car to facilitate safe removal of the plug and an to properly reseat the valve. Sealant tape was applied to the closure plug to mitigate further release.  RESCAR was contracted by the car owner to repair faulty packing found on the A-end liquid line during transloading procedure. This incident did require a special switching move.

Driver contained spilled material using absorbents and local soil until response crew arrived, at which time leaking drum was identified and material was recovered into salvage drum(s). Leaking drum was discovered to have thin area which had failed in transit. Drum specification markings wee not discernible.  Spilled material was largely contained within trailer. Based upon amount recovered, it is estimated that approximately 3 gallons tctal were released from trailer, with in excess of two gallons released at location of trailer stop, and subsequently recovered from shoulder.  Leaks were determined to be slow leaks from “pin” holes through drum sidewall in corroded/abraded area not evident from drum exterior.","Shippers must ensure integrity of packaging’s used for shipment of hazardous materials, and must also ensure that UN/DOT specification markings are readily visible. In the interest of proper package securement, drums are often shrink-wrapped to skids, el1fectively preventing the complete inspection of those drums. When a single drum is part of a larger consolidated shipment that is pre-loaded, the carrier has little opportunity to visibly inspect every drum; in many cases, such inspections are impracticable if not impossible. The problem is exacerbated when a carrier is not the first carrier to take pos4ession of the materials, as was the case in this incident.   While every effort is made to ensure the proper transportation of hazardous materials, the entire process begins with the ship.  The shipper therefore has the greatest responsibility for and influence on the success of the transport.  As a result, greater emphasis must be placed upon proper packaging selection by the shipper.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4100,"SJ TRANSPORTAION CO., INC.",US,

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a Clean Harbor’s in transit storage facility for the purposes of consolidating less than truck load quantities onto a single vehicle for continued transportation.  During the consolidation process, it was noticed that the closure of one of the containers was not properly secured and it allowed approximately 8 ounces of material to escape onto the floor of the van trailer.  Facility personnel, utilizing appropriate personal protective equipment, secured the closure device and decontaminated both the container and the floor of the van trailer.

Clean up began at 1316 and was completed at 1600 with no adverse effects to the environment or community.  It was determined that a nut was missing from a ""U"" bolt.  This ""U"" bolt securred a 2"" vent line attached to a 1"" PVC air pipe. The loose U"" bolt allowed the vent line to vibrate during transit cracking the PVC pipe and breaking the 2"" vent line.

The packages were loaded onto feeder A/C N796FE.  After loading the package onto the feeder it was discovered leaking.  The manager stopped the onload, contacted feeder A/C maintenance and had all unaffected packages loaded onto a different A/C while feeder maintenance inspected the A/C for possible damage caused by the spill.  There were three boxes from this shipper,only one was leaking.  When opening the leaking box we discovered a box inside with class 8 label and a FedEx DG inspection sticker from a previous shipment.  DG Administration (Mike Chambers) was contacted.  He took the product code and name and found the MSDS on the Kodak website.  All three boxes contained the same material.  This undeclared DG was reported to Drew Strabala, FAA agent in Denver.  He said he could not make the long distance trip and requested we send the 5800 and take specific photos of everything.","Mike Chambers contacted the shipper and spoke with Lee Rivera.  She said they were not trained or certified and did not know what to do with this chemical. The Manager at Most Healthcare has decided to not ship this chemical any longer but let Kodak ship for them.  This shipper had the same chemical shipment leaving Wyoming on Sep 18 that did not have a shipper's declaration form.  Our office assisted them to produce the documentation and send it to Wyoming so the package could move to New Jersey.  The package was reinspected and accepted to send to their office in Voorhees, NJ.  We informed them not to ship DG again until they were trained.  THAT shipment was the same package found inside the leaking box going from Voorhees back to Wyoming because it still had the tracking number and DG inspection sticker on it.  They clearly do not know what they are doing and did not heed our warning not to ship DG again.  DG Administration is considering a prohibition of package shipping by this company.  The FedEx Station manager in New Jersey that supports this customer was informed to advise the pick up courier to bring ANY packages from Most Healthcare to the DG inspector for spot checking.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION,US,

NRC Environmental Services, Inc. investigated the trailer and discovered one (1) leaking 55-gallon drum.  Approximately ten (10) gallons of free product were released and impacted the trailer floor.  Apparently the release was the result of the drum being punctured by a nail on the skid.  NRC Environmental Services, Inc. applied absorbent material as needed and over-packed the leaking drum.

Richter, and Conrail's emergency response contractor R.Gould of REACT Environmental Services revealed the following: (manway cover safety bolt cable seal ""SYS 017077"" intact; protective housing/breadbox cover cable seal ""SYS 017076"" intact); Seven of eight manway cover securement bolts less than hand tight; one of eight manway cover securement bolts was not applied; and, the manway cover gasket was missing.      After contact with both shipper and consignee personnel on compatiblity, a Viton manway nozzle gasket was applied, and manway cover was closed and secured tool tight.  Inspection of fittings under protective housing/breadbox cover conducted and no exceptions noted.

SWS, a CSXT emergency response contractor, and Hazardous Materials Manager, Chris Machenberg, were dispatched to the scene and found product leaking from around the threads of the outlet nozzle reducer. Upon further inspection, it was found that the bottom outlet nozzle reducer was loose and the top operated bottom outlet valve was also loose. The packing gland nut was loose and the operating rod was less than tool tight. The valve and packing gland nut was secured.     The bottom outlet nozzle reducer was removed and product was still leaking from the outlet valve in the form of a steady drip. Inspection of the gasket in the outlet nozzle reducer found the gasket material had deteriorated and failed. Also, the secondary valve  was clogged with hardened residue material that could not be removed. SWS replaced the gasket, the leak stopped and the car was decontaminated.  Due to the defective valve, the shipper transferred the car into trucks. The car is awaiting movement approval to a repair facility. This incident did require a special switching move.

Due to the nature of the product involved, the product corroded the metal drum and leaked onto the dock at the facility.  A&D Environmental of High Point, North Carolina was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, the drum had been placed on cardboard, and was isolated on a pavement surface in the lot at the facility.  A&D Environmental neutralized the free product with the application of soda ash and kitty litter to the free liquid on the dock and pavement.  The spent soda ash, kitty litter, neutralized product, and cleanup debris were containerized into one (1) 85-gallon recovery drum.  The damaged 15-gallon drum was overpacked into one (1) 30-gallon overpack, pending disposal.  There were no soils or waters of the state affected or threatened by the release.  Two (2) recovery drums of waste were generated during cleanup.  One (1)85-gallon overpack w/cleanup debris and neutralized product, and one (1) 30-gallon drum w/the damaged drum.  Disposal will be coordinated in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.

Upon closer inspection, it was determined that a piece of angle iron that is designed to act as a channel for the gasket when pressure is applied from closing, had a broken stitch weld. This broken weld allowed the angle iron to pull slightly from the container, which in turn released torque from the gasket, thus eliminating the integrity of the seal. The local New York DEC office was contacted and Clean Harbors was given permission to transfer the product to another vacuum box on site. A field service crew performed the transfer using the proper PPE. The laod transfer was conducted without incident and the damaged container was placed out of service pending repairs.","At the time the load was nitially accepted for transportation, an inspection of the rear seal found no visual evidence of leaking or damage.

It had a capacity of 11,800 gallons and ended up at 74% after the spill?  The overflow tube on the tank is set at 100% or the very top.  They have warning sensors that are supposed to go off at 90% and again at 95%.  The customer believes air pressure used during the delivery is what caused the spill to happen.  We agree in that spills can happen as a result of using air pressure, especially if the hoses go empty and air continues to feed through.  However in the past 30 years, every incident that has occurred as a result of continued air pressure at the end of a delivery, a small amount sprays up and hits the ceiling and 10-15 gallons is the spilled amount.  This is when the customer tank is near full.  This tank in question had quite a bit of headspace if it was only at 74% capacity.  Bubbling or bursting air inside the tank would have a hard time bursting 1000 gallons through the top.  This would have had to continue for quite some time!  The electronic chart on their tank supports the fact that we did not come close to overflowing the tank.  The pictures show where product was clearly overflowing from the tank.  That means the sensors and gauges inside must be off as the sensors never went off and the capacity should have had ample room to fit in the tank.  There is nothing associated to this incident that gives me any feeling we were the root cause on this.",We are making the recommendation to the customer to have the electronic hardware in their tank checked.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,7500,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

NATX 37686 was cordoned off in the railyard. The local FD responded and initiated spill containment procedures using absorbent pads and a catch receptacle under the NATX 37686. BNSF contract responders and a BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected NATX 37686. The responders reported that the leak source was from the liquid line valve. The 3 inch ball valve on the liquid line was partially open due to this valve's handle resting on the one inch vapor valve which prevented movement to full closure of the valve. Product was bypassing the liquid valve's closure plug. Internal pressure within the tank car was relieved via the vapor valve. Responders tightened the liquid valve to a position where the valve's handle could be fully closed. The closure plug was removed, cleaned, Teflon taped and reapplied to a tool tight condition. It was also noted that the vapor valve's closure plug was not applied and it too was cleaned, Teflon taped and applied to a tool tight condition. Securement was finalized by 1855 hrs, CDT, 10/06/09. Spillage within the valve housing area, on the tank shell and the ground impact areas were sprayed down with Microblaze followed by a water rinse from an onsite FD vehicle. Approximately 20 gallons of non-contaminated product captured in the catch receptacle was poured back into NATX 37686 via the manway. Intact seals removed were numbered BDWRR 0006174, 0006175 and then replaced with seals numbered SRS 000414,000415.   The side specification stencil indicated that the last tank qualification of NATX 37686 was completed in the year 2007 and next due in 2017.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6720,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The sliding motion caused these drums to move and hit against the row of drums all the way in the front of the truck.    This impact caused one of the lids of a 55-gallon drum containing paint related material to pop off and create a leak inside the trailer. Upon noticing through his mirrors that the liquid was dripping out of the vehicle the driver pulled along the side of the freeway and started to take appropriate remedial actions including, berming, setting up of triangles, containment etc. The driver also called for help at the same time. A response crew arrived on scene. The spill was mainly contained within the trailer and is estimated to be approximately 5 gallons. There was some liquid which hit the ground which was also remediated by the response crew.     Upon containing of the release and securing of the load the vehicle, was taken back to the Veolia facility.","The load was secured using a ratchet style load bar which was not able to hold the load as the shift occurred due to the sudden braking of the vehicle.

BNSF operating and mechanical responders inspected UTLX 211064 finding the leak source at the 165 psi pressure relief device (PRD) which appeared not to be reclosing. Product spillage on the tank shell was evaporating. UTLX 211064 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard awaiting repair. The shipper requested a tank car mobile repair service provider to inspect and repair UTLX 211064, but the repair provider would not perform repair work on a loaded tank car of flammable liquid.  The shipper then arranged for UTLX 211064 to be off loaded with the product transferred to trucks and this was accomplished on 10/14/2009 without further incident. The shipper then arranged for a suitable replacement PRD to be sent and installed on UTLX 211064.   On 10/27/2009, a BNSF contractor removed the failed PRD (UTC serial number 46421) which had a broken stem and was missing the spring, follower and associated nut hardware. These missing items were inside the tank and retrieved by the contract responders. The replacement PRD (a 75 psi Midland PRD) was installed and properly secured and verified by a Union Tank Car (UTC) representative overseeing this repair work. UTLX 211064 was scheduled to be moved to an UTC repair facility for pressure testing under FRA movement approval FRA-09100477 (Revised).",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3505,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The tote was taller than the side rails on the trailer. A ""load binding"" strap was around the mid portion of the tote to prevent sliding or over turning.Driver was leaving a parking lot making a sharp turn onto the highway. The elevation of the parking lot and roadway were uneven.The combination of the turn and uneven elevation caused the trailer to ""twist or flex"".This created stress on the tote at the strapped area of the tote tank. This stress caused the tote to fail and split diagonally across one sideThe driver immediately called 911 and his supervisor to report the incident. Emergency responders arrived at the scene in a matter on minutes. A ditch along the highway was dammed up. The responders used water to dilute the Sodium Hypochlorite to neutral PH.An environmental service was called to the scene to vacuum up the diluted material for proper disposal.","Transportation of totes of this particular type or design should be limited to a box truck, box trailer or flat bed with siderails or walls as tall as the tote.Totes should be designed so that the structural frame extends beyond the diameter of the ""tank"" all the way around to protect the ""tank"".Totes should have accommodations for attaching straps or chains to them to prevent movement during transportation.",Yes,IBC,"For liquids, when stacked",31H1,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,4343,JCI JONES CHEMICALS INC,US,

The spill was contained and cleaned up and the drum inside the leaking over pack drum was placed into a new over pack drum. All clean up materials were disposed of in accordance to State and federal laws.,It has been my experience that drum chimes can and do occasionally leak even when there is no noted damage to the chime.

During a joint FRA/BNSF mechanical inspection, intact seal numbered 583636 was removed to inspect the valves under the valve housing cover. Inspection revealed that all valves were in the closed position and their corresponding closure plugs tool tight. Product was bypassing the 3 inch liquid valve's closure plug. PPRX 28540 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard. BNSF contract responders were called to remedy the product leak. The contract responders opened the vapor valve to reduce internal pressure within PPRX 28540 and also performed air monitoring during this process. The liquid valve was then inspected and found closed with its closure plug tool tight. The plug was removed and no thread sealant was observed on the threaded portion of this plug. No product was observed in the open valve orifice after the plug was removed. The Teflon seal atop the ball valve appeared not fully seated with approximately one inch circumference of this seal out of position.  The responders reseated this seal and the valve was cycled open/closed to ensure the seal remained properly seated. Thread sealant was applied to the closure plug's threaded area, the plug placed into position and tool tightened. Spillage around the valve housing and on the tank shell was wiped. Responders monitored PPRX 28540 afterwards for approximately two hours with no further product release evident. The valve housing cover was closed, secured and sealed with seal numbered 5116. Response was concluded by 1900 hrs. MDT, 10/19/2009.  PPRX 28540's side specification stencil indicated that its last tank qualification was completed in the year 2006 and next due in 2016.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1456,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Receiving location's storeroom personnel incorrectly gauged tank and ordered 700 gallons. Driver of bulk delivery truck had unloaded 578 gallons of diesel when diesel came out the vent off the top of the tank. Driver immediately noticed the overfill and quickly shut off his pump. Driver notified storeroom personnel and began placing absorbent pads on the spill. Diesel primarily entered the tank secondary containment area, although a very small amount was blown onto the adjacent asphalt. Receiving location contacted a spill clean up contractor to clean and decontaminate the containment area, the tank, and the adjacent asphalt. It was estimated that less than 1/2 gallon of diesel was spilled due to the overfilling of the receiving facility's tank.The primary cause of the failure was due to a gauging error by the receiving facility storeroom personnel. More diesel was ordered than available tank capacity.",Storeroom personnel have come up with an action plan to prevent reoccurrence. The following are the key components of this action plan. 1. Use of a fuel log to double check gauging calculations 2. Verify gauging stick reaches bottom of tank 3. Require fuel vendor to gauge tank before delivery. Install fill valve locks to ensure that vendor can not off-load without storekeeper knowledge. Storekeeper to witness vendor gauging and compare readings. Storekeeper to post strapping charts on or near tank. 4. Use of fuel off-loading checklists.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,ENTERGY SABINE PLANT,US,

Robert Distr. was delivering off-road diesel fuel into CN Railroad Locomotive #2459 which was located on Zen-Noh Grain facility in Convent, LA.  Driver indicated that he had delivered most of the fuel into locomotive when fuel came out of fill tube and he turned off nozzle.  Driver removed absorbent pads from truck and placed them on top of fuel that was on part of rail bed and on concrete ditch.  Driver said that he had not noticed any other fuel on the ground and proceeded to notify one of employees of the spill and he thought was taken care of.  At approx. 18:00 one of ZGC employees noticed fuel on the far side of the trench & notified his supervisors.  The supervisors notified CNIC Railroad Jason Belamy who contacted Chris Lanoue of CN Railroad who arrived at location 21:00.  Also Robert Distr.'s personnel were notified and driver was immediately sent back to location with more pads to further assess the situation.  Sales rep for Robert notified Gayle Robert who was in route and arrived at location at approx 21:30. He met with CN and Zen-Noh personnel and asked that Zen-Noh report the incident, and they immediately called at 22:03 and reported the incident (Incident #09-05933), and proceeded to take steps for spill prevention:  put dirt into ditch to stop product form going off the immediate area; 7-8 absorbent booms were placed wherever there was any trace of fuel; bundle of absorbent pads were dispersed where needed.  Robert dispatched two of his men to assist in making sure that everything visible was absorbed by pads or booms and placed into metal containers.  The Robert employees arrived back at 8:00 next morning to further assist in cleaning and clearing anything needed. Further observations were made and all seems to be clean with no sheen or trace of fuel.  Contaminated soil and rags will be disposed of properly and site will be monitored by Zen-Noh and further information will be supplied as everything is completed.","The driver for this spill was terminated the next day.

Top inspection determined the vapor release was coming from the top forward area of the IM Tank where the (2) two dual combination pressure relief valves were located.  Hoyer, the tank owner, arranged to have SRS, their contracted hazardous material response contractor, fly in and remediate the leak.  Closer inspection by SRS developed the (4) four bolts that secure the PRV flange to the tank, were loose on the right side PRV, allowing vapors to escape.  The (4) bolts were properly secured, which stopped the leak.  The adjacent PRV was inspected and found to be intact.  The rear vapor and liquid lines were inspected and found the secondary (4) four bolt flange on the vapor valve, and the secondary (4) four bolt flange on the liquid line were less than tool tight.

Approx. 3.2 miles north of Mosquero, NM the road made an approx. 45 degree curve to the southwest. At the point where the curve initiated the driver failed to negotiate the curve and began to leave the roadway. The driver then corrected to attempt a correction back onto the roadway. At that point due to 1) severity of turn 2) no shoulder on roadway 3) incline of embankment the tractor and trailer rolled onto the passenger side. Upon crossing a drainage culvert at a cross street the rear compartment of the trailer shell was compromised by an approx 3' tear. The tractor and trailer continued another 180 degree roll and came to rest on the driver side. The dome lids on the intact compartments were releasing small amounts of material due to the positon at which the trailer was at rest. Raton, NM HazMat response unit arrived on seen and closed the roadway and secured the dome lids to prevent further leakage. At that point all material release was stopped approx 2 hours after initial accident. An empty tanker was dispatched from Amarillo, TX and the remaining material was transferred to the empty unit for transport back to Amarillo, Texas. Rivas Environmental Service of Amarillo, TX was contracted to remediate the site. Remediation by rivas continues under the direction of the New Mexico Department of Environmental Quality and the New Mexico Department of Transportation.","Continue to stress, in all safety meetings, the critical need to adjust speed appropriately to road and weather conditions.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,150982,FLYING STAR TRANSPORT,US,

Driver had completed connections from trailer outlet line valve to our product hose and tank connection fitting onto customer tank connection for the 87 octane gasoline and started product flow. Driver then completed connections from trailer outlet line valve to our product hose and tank connection fitting onto customer tank connections for the 93 octane gasoline and started product flow. Driver reports that he started to turn to his right (toward the front of our transport unit); heard a noise and turned his head back and noticed 6” x 4” adapter fitting for the 93 octane gasoline, had come loose from the trailer outlet product line and that gasoline (93 octane) was spilling from trailer outlet line and the 4” product hose, that had the 6” x4” adapter connected to it, had struck the ground (adapter fitting came loose from the connection to the trailer outlet piping). Driver then shut (closed) the valve compartment door of the trailer; which by doing so closed the belly valve of the trailer. Driver then picked up the product hose, which had fallen to the ground, and reconnected the hose (with the 6” x4” adapter back to the 6” outlet line of the trailer for the 93 octane gasoline. Driver used spill pads from our transport unit supply and spread in area to assist in controlling flow of the gasoline that had spilled that was traveling down a slight slope of the parking lot away from the unloading area. Driver then advised store personnel of the spill situation and the need for response to the spill situation. Local fire department, police department as well as the local street department which did place sand/absorbent materials onto the area that was impacted by the spilled gasoline. During the response, a representative of the WVDEP UST Division was enroute to his office for workday and also stopped and responded to the spill situation. Fire Department felt the spill incident had been contained and advised would respond later in day to sweep up and remove the gasoline impacted absorbent materials. Representative with the WVDEP advised facility owner to proceed with appropriate notifications and to have a certified environmental clean —up company respond to remediate the situation. WVDEP representative also advised the responding environmental remediation company to take directed samples from the location for remedial review. Environmental company (Ryan’s Environmental) completed all surface clean-up and performance of the taking of samples as directed the same day of the spill event). Pos the initial containment and clean-up of the unloading area our driver completed the delivery process of the gasoline products (both the 87 octane and the 93 octane); stick readings were taken, in the presence if the facility owner and the representative of the WVDEP, post the","Post incident interview with driver reflected: Driver claims the 6” x 4” Adapter fitting that connects on the 6” side to the trailer product outlet line and on the 4” side to the product hose that runs from our trailer connection to the customer tank connection came loose at the 6” side that connects to the trailer product outlet pipe connection. This fitting has Cam-Lock fasteners on both the 6” side and the 4” side. Driver stated that the 6”x4” adapter fitting appeared to be “tight” as he did not observe any appearance of the cam-lock ears not being in the closed/tightened position, nor did he detect any looseness of the fitting when he made connect ion of the product hose to the adapter fitting in preparation for the unloading of product from the trailer.   Post the incident the 6” x 4” adapter fitting, the trailer compartment product line outlet fitting and the 4” product hose cam lock fittings were all checked and no observable defects were noted. Proper connections, between and to each component, were made using the same components and it was found the components made tight and secure connections between all parts. All of the involved components have returned/continued in service and noted to be operating property.   Best assumption is that either the cam lock fittings (ears) had vibrated loose at some point prior to the driver making the hook-up connections of which the driver did not make note of the condition when he made his component connections prior to unloading or that the driver had not properly secured a seated/ tight position of one, or both, of the cam lock ears when he connected the 6” side of the 6” x4” adapter fitting to the trailer product outlet line fitting and as a result the connection became disengaged. Proper loading and unloading procedures are included in our classroom and field training with a driver trainer for all hired driver employees. Each driver employee receives a copy of our in- depth Driver Training Manual. We have ongoing quarterly safety and operational meetings with all of our driver personnel and will again target discussion and presentation of proper loading/unloading procedures to include specific reference to this particular incident in our next set of quarterly safety meetings and detail the proper procedures associated to component connections for both the loading and unloading process and how best to avoid this type of situation occurring. As noted, we have quarterly safety meetings and had just completed a week prior to this event our most recent quarterly safety meetings that as part of the covered topics included specific instruction on fitting and connection integrity at our customer delivery locations. As noted, we will again specifically target this topic in our next set of quarterly meetings and stress that driver employee observation and inspection of proper component connection is vital to avoid a situation such as this occurring.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5030,LYKINS TRANSPORTATION INC,US,

(A•C•T) Project Manager, Mr. Wayne Koszegi, CHMM to request assistance with a spill of Alkyd Resin.  The spill occurred at an EPS Drop Yard located at 231 Oak Ridge Drive in Hagerstown, Maryland. Ms. Lindsay advised that tanker #7287 developed a leak and released an estimated <10 gallons of product onto the sides of the tanker and soil parking area of the drop yard. No stormwater drains were in the area of the spill. No reporting was required as this spill was below the reportable quantity.  Additionally, Mr. John Bentley from the Washington County Emergency Management Agency was on site.       Upon arrival at the site, our response team advised that the resin had run down both sides of the tanker and a small amount had impacted the ground as shown in Figure 2 of the Maps and Photographs section of this report.  A•C•T emailed the MSDS to our response team, and the A•C•T project manager reviewed all safety measures required to clean this tanker. At the time of our response teams arrival there were no active leaks observed.    Our response team began the cleanup process by applying granular sorbents to the spilled material located on the parking area. After initial attempts to clean the tanker with MEK soaked rags were unsuccessfully, our response team switched to mineral spirits, which worked well.  During the cleanup operations the local fire department returned to the site and advised that there was product impacting a railroad crossing and the roadway leading to the drop yard and that cars are driving through the product.  Our response investigated the area.  No pooling was found at the railroad crossing.  A small amount of the resin was found on the roadway, but it was hardened and would not cause any problems.      On Tuesday, October 13, 2009 our response team returned to site to continue the clean-up process.  They reported that additional product had run down the sides of the tanker.  Apparently this was product that pooled on the top of the tanker that our response team was unable to see due to darkness the night before.  Our response team then began hand scraping the resin off the tanker. Our response team continued to clean the tanker until it became too dark to operate safely.  They will have to return for a third day to complete the cleanup.  Quality Carriers was undated and approved a third day of operations.    On Wednesday, October 14, 2009 our response team returned to the site to complete cleanup operations.  The final amount of resin on the sides of the trailer was scraped off and the tanker was wiped down with mineral spirits.  There was an area on the top of the tanker (under the catwalk) that was inaccessible, which did contain some hardened resin material.  All drummed waste was staged on site for future disposal.

(A•C•T) Nationwide Project Manager, Mr. Gary L. Weiss to request assistance with a spill of Jeffamine D 2000 a Polyoxypropylenediamine Liquid (UN 2735). The spill occurred at a Pilot Truck Stop located at 259 Cherry Blossom Blvd. in Georgetown, Kentucky. Ms. LeBlanc advised that Mr. Mark Triman, the Quality Carriers driver, reported that his tanker was leaking product from the dome assembly.  A•C•T Project manager requested that Mr. Timan place a bucket under the leak and scrape some soil to build a dam to contain the spill and minimize the impact on the ground. Mr. Jack Donovan from the Scott County Emergency Management Agency was on site and advised that he notified KY-DEC and that the leak had been stopped.       Upon arrival at the site, our response team advised that the Scott County Fire Department was still inspecting the tanker.  Once the fire department completed their inspection they allowed our response team to enter the “hot zone”.  Our response team inspected the dome assembly area of the tanker and observed no active leaking.  The truck driver was asked to rock the truck back and forth a few times to make sure that the leak had stopped.  Our response team observed that there was still a leak in the dome assembly when the truck was rocked. The leak was isolated to a pressure release valve.  Sky Tank was contacted any advised that they would need a repair contractor to respond.     Our response team began the cleanup process by wiping down the exterior of the tanker where the product ran down.  All the wipe cloths were placed into a 30-gallon drum along with the absorbent media that the fire department had applied to solidify the product.    WASTE DISPOSAL    As a result of the response activities, one (1) 30-gallon drum of waste was generated.  After consulting with Mr. Rob Smale of Quality Distribution, a waste profile was developed. Upon profile approval, the waste was manifested and transported to Klor Kleen located in Cincinnati, Ohio for disposal.",,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,9500,"American Compliance Technologies, Inc.",US,

Mr. Weiss spoke to Hazardous Material Specialist Ishmael Gonzalez from the LACoFD HMT, Mr. Gonzalez reported that the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) was cleaning up the roadway with sand and no private cleanup contractor would be needed.  Additionally, Mr. Gonzalez advised that there may be some damage in the dome lid area, but at this time no action is required.  The California Highway Patrol (CHP) conducted a complete vehicle inspection on the truck and tanker and advised Sky Tank personnel of the status of the tanker and any required service that would need to be performed.",,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"American Compliance Technologies, Inc.",US,

At that time the driver moved to the shoulder of the road to minimize potential property and injury to motorists traveling the interstate.  The elevated temperature oil caused the moisture to expand at a rate greater than tank vents can exhaust, causing a release of the material under pressure thru the dome lid.  When this situation occurs there is little to be done but protect people and property from damage.  Once the pressure was released the trailer maintained its integrity and no further product was lost.  The release of pressure and material lasted approximately 2 minutes.",We are monitoring the drying out of trailers more closely to ensure all moister is removed.

At 8:16 today, Operations Supervisor Doug Short came to my office to report trailer # v6Ols had arrived from LAX and there was smoke coming out of the rear of the trailer door and a lIquid was leaking on the ground. He had the Mnifest with the shipments and the description 01 the one hazardous material on bill # 10843006 from Flo Kern that was on the trailer. I grabbed a Emergency Response Guidebopk from Ed Cox In dispatch office on my way out to access the situation. Upon approaching the trailer I could see smoke coming out of the rear of the trailer, and it smelled like a corrosive material. The trailer was in the west part of the parking lot inside the gate. I told everyone to get away from the trailer as the ERG Book stated It was harmful to inhale the vapors. I then proceeded to my office and Called Dave Martin to inform him of the situation. After explaining the situation, Dave told me to call the fire Department because of the Smoke and also contact our Haz Mat clean-up people, which is Ramos Environmental Service. I call Ramos first and Talk to John Villanueva so I could quickly get him on the scene and he could assist with the spill. I then called 911 and got the fire department on their way. By 8:30 John from Ramos had arrived and shortly after 8:30 the fire Department arrived on the scene. We were instructed by the Fire Department to evacuate the building and move across the street to the east and move down the street to the north to get out of the direction the wind was going. I told the commander on duty I would be the point of contact. He wanted to do a quick walk through the building with me to be sure everyone was out. When that was completed we shut the gates. I then called Rita In Oakland and advised her we were being evacuated, and would advise when we were let back in. Trade had also notified Sherri in Reno. The Fire Department shut down F Street and evacuated the two businesses to the south of us. They also shut down E Street at the entrance off of F Street. They got into the trailer and found the drum on the above mentioned pro had been compromised. At that point they called in the Sacramento Fire Department Hazmat team to contain the leaking 55 Gallon Drum. Once that was done around 10:15. John From Ranios came and got me and said they wanted to debrief and so they could close the case and exit the scene. At the debrief; Sacramento Fire Department Has Mat Response commander; Chief Vasquez. West Sacramento Battalion Chief; Capt. Becky Ramirez Yolo County Health Department. (No Name given) Ramos Environmental Service John Vilianueva Oak Harbor Freight Lines TM Greg G. Chief Vasquez was in charge at that point. He said the Hazardous Material has been contained and his Job was done, he passed the scene to Captain Becky Ramirez. She said the potential fire hazard was eliminated and their Job was done. Passed the scene to The Yolo County Health Department.

The supervisor contaced airport emergency services to investigate the issue.  Once here the emergency services determined that they could not isolate the cause of the odor and checked out the employees that were unloading the aircraft.  The employees were cleard by EMS and offered to take them to the hospital for further checking which all three refused and signed documents stating such.  Later, all three went to a local first aid service, were looked at, released and were present at work the next day.
