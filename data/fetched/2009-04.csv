From the information received by the contractor and photos of the unit, it appears that there was improper blocking/bracing...one of the pallets used for blocking/bracing caused the outer portion of the IBC to break resulting in a puncture in the top portion of the inner IBC.  OR...the product expanded inside the IBC resulting in the top portion of the IBC to rupture and causing the outer IBC to break.  There is no way to estimate the duration of the release.  The container was ingated in TX and arrived in CA leaking.  The size of the hole was approximately the size of a pen in the upper right corner of the inner IBC.  The outer IBC was busted down the entire corner on the same side that the hole occurred.","Shipper has been notified of the spill/leak.  Container was preloaded and our driver would not have been able to verify the entire contents of the container for blocking/bracing.

At the time the material was accepted for transportation, the driver inspected the containers and identified no evidence of leaking or damage.  The driver did, however, fail to identify that an incorrect package was selected for the transportation of a waste stream containing a liquid component.  During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at Clean Harbor's 10-day in transit storage facility located in Redisville North Carolina for the purpose of consolidating a less than truckload quantity of hazardous waste onto a secodn transport vehicle for continued transportation.  Upon arrival at this location, the load was inspected and it was identified that approximatley 1 pint of liquid had escaped from the container onto the floor of the van trailer.  Facility personnel immediately absorbed the free liquids with a suitable absorbant material and initiated a response action.  This response action included the solidifcation of the liquid component of the material and repackageing the 2 IBC's into alternate package for continued transportation.  ALl clean-up debris was added to the containers and was disposed of at the intended waste management facility.  This operation was conducted without incident.","In order to prevent a recurrence, the customer has been notified of the incident and has been advised that an alternate container must be used for future shipments.  In additon, we have taken appropriate actions to both re train the driver and issue disciplinary actions to educate and illustrate the serious nature of his failure to conduct a proper inspection of containers being accepted for transportation.  Finally, a review of proper package selection and inspection has taken place with all drivers associated with this business unit to ensure that all employees are aware of the incident and the corrective actions taken to preclude a repeat occurence.",No,IBC,"Plastic with liner, for solids",13H3,Yes,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

Upon arrival, the driver connected the transfer hose and placed a containment/spill pan under the connection.  As the loading operation was nearing completion, the driver noticed that a leak developed from the hose in close proximity to the point where it connected to the tank where product was being extracted from.  The driver immediately shut the pump off and closed the valves to prevent a significant release.  Before he could finish closing the valve, approximately 10 gallons of product was released to the spill containment pan and the concrete containment area where the transfer was being conducted.  The driver immediately notified the shipper and proceeded to switch out the damaged hose.  With the replacement hose in place, the driver vacuumed uu all free liquids into the tank and then spread an absorbant material on any residual liquid not able to be collected with the hose.  This material was containerized and placed into storage at the shipper's location pending shipment to a licensed waste management facility. Once the area was cleaned to the satisfaction of the shipper, the driver secured the transfer equipemnt and proceeded to the intended waste management facility.","At the conclusion of the spill clean-up, the damaged hose was inspected at it was discovered that a crack measuring between 1 - 2 inches developed in the body of the hose close to the fitting.  THis crack was not visible at the time the driver connected the hose to the transfer tank.  Upon return to the driver's home dispatch location, the hose in question was disposed of and a replacement hose put in its place.  In order to orevent a recurrence, the driver was een re instructed to ensure that a thorough inspection be performed on all transfer/delivery hoses and those showing evidence of deterioration be taken out of service and replaced.  In addition, the terminal manager will be inspecting all hoses assigned to his location for the purpose of identifying any hoses that show evidence of excessive wear and/or deterioration.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper was notified via CHEMTREC (# 2009-04-03-00022). SWS, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the liquid line valve was less than hand tight on the liquid line pipe nozzle. SWS personnel tightened the liquid valve on the liquid line pipe nozzle and the leak stopped.  The car was decontaminated and the shipper obtained a FRA movement approval (# FRA - 09040141).

This shipment was to be transferred to a Veolia truck and sent for delivery to the Veolia, Phoenix AZ facility. Upon delivery to the Port Washington, WI facility, a small amount of an oily liquid was discovered in the secondary containment system within the trailer. Upon further inspection it was determined that the oil was from a PCB contaminated transformer (273 ppm PCB). It was also determined that less than one gallon of oil was released in the trailer. The spilled PCB contaminated oil was cleaned up and containerized for disposal. The transformer inspection also revealed that the cover on top of the transformer had not been properly secured prior to shipment. The movement of the oil within the transformer during transport caused some of the oil to spill out of the top of the transformer. Following clean up the transformer was resealed and transported to the Veolia Phoenix facility without further incident.",An internal safety alert document was distributed to all Veolia ES Technical Solutions locations to be used a training tool.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

The integrity of the packages was compromised due to the packages rubbing against the side of the inside of the container. The product never left the confines of the container. Investigation was done by the shipper and they believe that the problem lies in the pallet size rather than cardboard on the side of the container, however, the shipper has indicated that they will still put cardboard or another means to protect the load from the rivets or any other problem the walls of the container might present. Photos were taken showing that the super sacks were compromised.”","The incident has been brought to the shipper’s attention. Shipper has performed an investigation and has discussed the proposed outcome with us. ShiØper believes that current blocking/bracing measures are sufficient and that changes to pallet size and added protection will eliminate any future incidents. Additional explanation is included as an attachment that Shipper has sent to Carrier. Carrier agrees with Shipper that proposed measures should eliminate the problem. Photos of the new measures have also been included. Additionally Shipper has notified Carrier that photos are taken of every load before dispatch for quality assurance measures.”  Shipper has taken great measures to insure that there will be no environmental issues. With the measures taken, we feel that future incidents will be extremely minimal.

JBHU 244030 was carefully deramped and placed within the intermodal facility's containment area. Shipper contractor's inspection of JBHU 244030 revealed a poly IBC (UN Spec 31HA1) near mid-container that had a cut at the top front corner of this IBC. Movement during transit resulted in product being expelled from the opening at this cut area. It appeared that the cut was at the edge of a depression that may have been caused by an object falling atop of this IBC. The remaining product within the compromised IBC was transferred into another suitable IBC and the spillage inside the intermodal container was cleaned. Afterwards, all lading removed was reloaded inside of the cleaned container, adjusted and blocked/braced for further transportation. The spillage on the outside of JBHU 244030 and the other impacted intermodal container was cleaned. Response was concluded by approximately 1800 hrs.

He was unable to avoid hitting a 300 lb hydraulic jack in a crate on the roadway that most likely fell off another truck.  The driver then lost control and struck a concrete barrier causing the tractor/trailer to roll on to it's side.  There was a diesel spill but only a minor product spill coming a drip from a washout cap on one of the compartments of the cargo tank. The highway was closed down for about 12 hours until the product could be safely transferred to another cargo tank.

The tank car was isolated and the shipper, Shell Chemical was notified thru CHEMTREC (#2009-04-19-00032). State and local officials were also notified of the incident. SWS / Eagle Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, SWS / Eagle personnel found two manway bolts were less than tool tight. The manway was opened to check the gasket; SWS representatives found that the tank car was full to within 1 inch of the top of the manway nozzle. The shipper was notified again of the problem and dispatched a truck to off load 3,000 gallons. When the transfer was completed, the car was decontaminated, sealed and sent on to destination.

The UNIVAR driver did not notice anything unusual during the loading of waste onto our truck, the driver secured load for return to UNIVAR USA Inc. 220 S Barnes Springfield, MO. Upon arrival at UNIVAR at approximately 2:15 pm, the driver noticed liquid dripping from the trailer. Our driver notified company officals who notified the National Response Center along with both the Missouri and Kansas DNR. A response contractor was retained to clean up the leaking containers, UNIVAR trailer and equipment. A UNIVAR supervisor retraced the truck's route from Fort Scott KS to Springfield MO and discovered 4 locations where the material had leaked during traffic stops. The response contractor was dispatched to the 4 locations and where they cleaned the roadbed of the residual material, the locations are as follows:  1. Kansas - Intersection of Highway 69 and Highway 54 (approximately 3-4 lbs)  2. Missouri - Intersection of Highway 54 and Ash (approximately 2-3 lbs)  3. Missouri - Intersection of Highway 54 and Washington 9 approximately 2-3 lbs)  4. Missouri - Chestnut and Barnes in Springfield (approximately 2-3 lbs)  Clean up was completed by approximately 2:15 am April 9, 2009.  Our investigation has determined that the filtercake had not been completely pressed allowing liquid to accumulate on the surface of the filtercake.

APPARENTLY THE FEMAIL QUICK-COUPLER BECAME LOOSE AND FELL FROM THE MAIL QUICK-COUPLER ALLOWING PRODUCT TO FREE FLOW FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK.  SINCE THE BALL VALVE WAS NOT IN THE ""CLOSED"" POSITION, MATERIAL WAS FREELY FLOWING ONTO THE TRUCK BED AND THEN TO THE GROUND.  THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK, DAVID WEIDE, UNAWARE OF WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE PULLED THE TRUCK ALONG SIDE THE OFFICE AND A FELLOW EMPLOYEE NOTICED THE MATERIAL BEING SPILLED AND QUICKLY TURNED OFF THE VALVE.  WE ESTIMATE THAT 15 GALLONS OF N-SERVE WAS LOST ON THE 3 1/2 BLOCK STRETCH OF MAIN STREET, (REFERRED TO AS 1ST STREET) AND 25 GALLON WAS LOST WHERE THE TRUCK WAS PARKED.  THE CITY OF MESERVEY SPREAD GRAVEL ON THE AFFECTED AREA (OHIO STREET TO DES MOINES STREET) AND USED A TRACTOR AND BLADE TO SPREAD THE GRAVEL EVENLY TO GET MAXIMUM ABSORPTION. FLOOR DRY AND FINE LIMSTONE WAS THEN BROUGHT IN TO HELP WITH WET SPOTS TO CLEAN THEM UP AS WELL.  IT WAS SPREAD OUT, PUSHED ABOUT WITH A BROOM AND ALLOWED TO SOAK UP WHAT LITTLE MATERIAL WAS LEFT BEHIND THE GRAVEL APPLICATION.  THE MATERIAL UNDER THE TRUCK HAD POOLED ON THE CRUSHED ROCK AND GRAVEL BASE AND A SKID STEER LOADER WAS USED TO DIG DOWN TO WHERE THE PRODUCT HAD MIGRATED, WHICH WAS ABOUT 1 FOOT.  ALL RECOVERED CONTAMINATED ROCK, GRAVEL, AND ABSORBENT MATERIAL WAS STAGED IN A CONTAINMENT PAD WHERE IT WILL BE SPREAD OVER FARM LAND.  I ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 4:00 PM AND THE MATERIAL WAS ALREADY REMOVED FROM WHERE THE TRUCK PARKED AND THE GRAVEL THAT WAS APPLIED TO THE STREET WAS WORKING WELL TO ABSORB THE MATERIAL AND WAS READY FOR PROPER PICKUP.  13 EMPLOYEES WITH BROOMS, SHOVELS AND A SKID STEER LOADER SWEPT THE ENTIRE WEST SIDE OF THE STREET AND RECOVERED THE MATERIAL IN A VERY ORDERLY AND METHODICAL FASHION.  THE SKID STEER LOADER WAS USED TO SCRAPE THE MATERIAL IN SMALL PILES WHERE IT WAS THEN SHOVELED INTO THE BUCKET AND PUT INTO THE RECOVERY AREA.  MERSERVEY LEADERS JON KADUCE (ALSO THE FIRE CHIEF) AND FRANK UHDE TOOK CONTROL OF THE SITUATION FROM THE BEGINNING AND DID A GOOD JOB IN CONTROLLING TRAFFIC FROM TRACKING THE MATERIAL ELSEWHERE. A FIRE DEPARTMENT PICKUP WAS STAGED AT ONE END OF THE CLEANUP ZONE AND ANOTHER FIRE DEPARTMENT VAN PARKED AT THE OTHER END OF THE SPILL AREA TO KEEP THE MINIMAL TRAFFIC SLOWED DOWN AS THEY PASSED BY FOR THE SAFETY OF THE EMPLOYEES DOING THE CLEANUP.  ON MY TRIP TO THE SCENE I ASKED THE LOCATION TO GET THE MSDS SHEETS READY FOR REVIEW AND TO HAVE THE EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN READY AS WELL SO THE VARIOUS AGENCIES COULD BE CONTACTED.  UPON MY ARRIVAL I REVIEWED THE MSDS TO MAKE SURE THE EMPLOYEES WERE NOT SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL HAZARDS AND THAT PROPER CLEANUP PROCEDURES COULD CONTINE IF POSSIBLE. AT ABOUT 4:15 I CALLED PERS AND TALKED WITH LES ABOUT WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE.  SINCE THIS PRODUCT WAS","THE SOLUTION TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF RELEASE IS TO FOLLOW PROCEDURE AND PROTOCOL.  EMPLOYEES ARE GIVEN YEARLY FORMAL INSTRUCTION AS WELL AS PERIODIC REMINDERS FROM THEIR SUPERVISOR ON HOW TO CONDUCT A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE DELIVERY.  IF THE EMPLOYEE CHOOSES TO IGNORE THIS INSTRUCTION THEN THE SYSTEM BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN.  THE VALVE IS IN PLACE FOR A REASON...THE CAM-LOCK IS ALSO THERE FOR A REASON, BUT IF THE TOOLS ARE NOT USED AS THEY WERE DESIGNED AND INTENDED THEN THE LEVEL OF RISK INCREASES DRAMATICALLY AND WE LEAVE OUR DESTINY UP TO FATE RATHER THAN PROPER INSTRUCTION AND PREPARATION.  WE HAVE PUT OUT A STERN MESSAGE TO THE ENTIRE MAXYIELD TEAM TO MAKE ALL TRANSPORTS SAFE.  THIS BEGINS WITH DOING A THOROUGH WALK AROUND THE VEHICLE LOOKING FOR ANY FLAGS THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A FAILURE OR ACCIDENT.  THINGS TO LOOK FOR MIGHT INCLUDE LOOSE HOSES, OPEN VALVES, LOOSE LUG NUTS, LEAKAGE OF A TANK, TANKS NOT PROPERLY SECURED, PROPER PLACARDS, ITEMS ON THE DECK THAT ARE NOT SECURED WHICH COULD BLOW OFF, ALL HOSE CONNECTIONS SECURED, POWER TO A PUMP DISCONNECTED, ETC.  THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE MANY THINGS TO LOOK FOR PRIOR TO MOVING THE VEHICLE.  FOOTNOTE:  IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE FAILURE SOURCE COMES DOWN TO AN INDIVIDUAL MAKING POOR CHOICES.  ALL THE SAFETY DEVICES IN THE WORLD WILL NOT MATTER IF WE DO NOT USE THEM.  IF WE CANNOT PROPERLY ENGAGE IN THE TASK, THEN WE SHOULD REMOVE OURSELVES FROM THE TASK ALTOGETHER BECAUSE WE BECOME AN ELEVATED RISK TO NOT ONLY OURSELVES, BUT THE PEOPLE WE WORK WITH AND THE COMPANY WE WORK FOR.

The car was isolated and the shipper was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2009-04-21-00122).  A CSXT emergency response contractor, Hepaco Environmental, was dispatched to the scene to make repairs. Upon arrival, Hepaco personnel slowed down the leak by reducing the pressure on the car thru the liquid and vapor lines, however, they could not stop the flow completely from the regulators. Shipper representatives transloaded 39,900 pounds of product and reduced the pressure in the rail car to 180 PSI. The leak stopped and the car was diverted back to the original point of loading in Augusta, GA.

The driver parked in the loading/unloading area, opened the cargo door and removed the securing devices from the IBC. The SES lift truck operator drove up to the rear of the truck, lifted the IBC and backed away from the truck. As the operator lowered the IBC to the ground, the center of gravity shifted causing the rear of the lift truck to tilt forward. This movement caused the IBC to slide off the forks of the lift truck. The IBC struck the concrete surface on its side causing the outer structure to fail which resulted in a crack at the top of the inner packaging. The driver immediately pulled his truck forward allowing the lift truck operator to move in front of the IBC and lift it into an upright position which stopped the flow of material. SES personnel flushed the concrete surface with water and removed the remaining material from the IBC to prevent further spillage.

The cause of this derailment was attributed to a broken rail (detail fracture). DBUX 302059 derailed all wheels and was leaning with the B-end facing downward towards the La Mirada Flood Control Channel that was adjacent to the track. A small amount of product leaked onto the side shell of DBUX 302059 that emanated from the valve flange connection at the liquid eduction line. Local F.D. responders placed a pool receptacle under DBUX 302059. BNSF contract responders tool tightened one of the four flange bolts approximately 1/4 to 1/2 turns to stop any further product release. At the time of securement, responders observed the spillage on the side shell was evaporating with no new product release evident. No product impacted the shallow water at the bottom of the channel. The contract responders also placed booms across the channel bottom to impede any undesired subsequent releases or debris. The contractors transferred the product within DBUX 302059 into tank trucks. The transfer was complete without incident by 1900 PDT, 4/09/09. Afterwards, DBUX 302059 was lifted from its overhanging position above the channel and rerailed.",No additional comments.,Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,12001,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The box was placed in a salvage drum.  The box was opened to reveal four 2.5L glass bottles. The bottles were seperated via a fibreboard partition.  There was no absorbent material and the cushioning material was in the form of styrofoam peanuts.  In addition there were no barrier bags to prevent a spilled material from escaping the box as required in 49CFR 173.27.  I asked the shipper, Adam Huegel, what the numbers and characters were for the second line on his UN POP marking. Adam said that the box, in this case, was reused and he did not have that information.  Hence, he could not have had the closure instructions.  Lastly, ICAO Packing Instruction 813 requires that glass inner packagings to be packed in a rigid plastic or metal intermediate packaging prior to being placed in the outer packaging.

Local Fire department, SC Department of Environmental Control, SCDOT, and Environmental contractor (A&D Environmental) crews worked to contain the spill and clean up. Because of the damage sustained in the crash to the cargo tank the duration of the leak was only minutes. Major damage to the overturn rails and manways (dome covers) because of the nature of the accident was the source of leakage.   East bound traffic was re-routed around the scene for approximately 6 hours. Over eight days of excavation, hauling contaminated dirt from the scene and bringing clean dirt back to the site, were required to mitigate the effects. Product did not reach any water, and was contained by natural berms.

It was first discovered by personnel at Sappi who found a couple of places inside their mill.  They then checked the Varney Road and Route 201 coming into their facility from Fairfield and found several spots on the above roads.  They notified the GAC truck driver, who called the GAC dispatch supervisor, who then notified Peter Goodwin, GAC Production/Safety Director.  Peter called Tom Griffin at Sappi and was informed of the situation.  From the information Peter was given, he determined there was a very good possibility there were other spills along the route the driver had taken.  Peter notified David Colter, GAC President, and the Maine State Police, who notified the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MeDEP).  GAC had a crew travel the route taken by the driver from Searsport to Skowhegan and, with help from Sappi personnel and the GAC truck driver, was able to locate five (5) places where sulfuric acid had been spilled.  They were in the following order from Searsport to Skowhegan:    At the railroad tracks just before the I-95 ramp on Route 201 in Fairfield   At the Hinckley Market on Route 201 in Fairfield.   At the railroad tracks just before the Sappi mill entrance on Route 201 in   Skowhegan   On the Varney Road between Route 201 and the Sappi mill rear entrance.   At the Sappi mill between the security gate and the Chem Prep unloading area.  There were two (2) teams of GAC personnel sent out with soda ash, shovels, brooms and 35 gallon poly drums with covers.  All the spills on the route from Searsport to Skowhegan were neutralized with soda ash and swept up.  Sappi personnel put soda ash on all the spills except for the one at the railroad tracks on Route 201 by the I-95 ramp, which GAC personnel took care of.  GAC personnel cleaned up the soda ash on all the spills.  The spills were the result of a faulty safety valve on a sulfuric acid tanker, which allowed acid to drizzle out every time the product sloshed around in the tank.  The sloshing would have been most predominant when starting after stopping and when downshifting on hills.  The tank is 55 inches in diameter and was filled to a level of 43 inches. Product would have most likely leaked out during greatest amount of sloshing.  The spill dam around the dome holds approximately a gallon of liquid before it reaches the 1” drain holes.   Based on this information and the size of the releases observed during the clean up process, we believe no more than 5-10 gallons were spilled.","Upon inspection of the safety valve at the GAC plant after the incident, the vacuum breaker part of the safety valve had come apart and the vacuum breaker disc had fallen into the tanker.  Inspection showed that the parts holding the vacuum breaker together had become corroded, allowing a pin to fall out, which in turn allowed a disc to unscrew and eventually come apart.  The safety valve had been pressure tested on March 16, 2009, during a quarterly inspection, and was found to be working properly.

The train crew stopped this train for closer inspection of SRIX 80246 by the train crew. The train's conductor visually inspected SRIX 80246 and reported that the spillage on the side shell appeared to be spillage deposited from the loading process since no active leak and no ground impact from the spillage was observed. The train then proceeded to the next terminal (Omaha, NE) were local BNSF operating personnel were alerted of this incident. The BNSF Assistant Director Hazardous Material whom was in Omaha was notified and inspected SRIX 80246 in detail. This BNSF responder reported finding one of eight manway securement bolts less than tool tight which prevented a good manway closure seal. The now cooled spillage atop this tank car and down the side shell emanated from the manway closure. The loose manway securement bolt was tool tightened. All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure. Seal numbered T88448598 was removed for valve inspection, but no replacement seal was readily available to the responder. Response was concluded by 1950 hrs. CDT, 4/28/09.

He notified the appropriate personnel and we responded to the incident at 1705 where we found sulfuric acid dripping down the side of the tank to the ground from the two inch discharge line on top of the car. The track was secured and M&M Protection services was called to secure the leak and clean up the product on the ground. M&M arrived on scene at 1800 hrs. They released the pressure on the car and stopped the leak at 1830 at which time they began to neutralize the sulfuric acid. The cause of the leak was a cracked cap on the discharge pipe. It appears to be from wear and deterioration of the cap. THe crack ran from top to bottom on the cap, approx. three inches. Product was released account of the pressure increase in the car from the heat of the day. It was approximately 93 degrees and sunny.  The pressure forced product into the discharge pipe and through the crack in the cap. Estimated loss of product was five to ten gallons. M&M spread eight bags of soda ash on the ground to begin neutralizing the acid. They then pressure washed the car using a sodium bicarbonate solution. After cleaning the car they applied the sodium bicarbonate solution to the ground to completely neutralize the acid.  Cleanup was completed at approximately 2045.  The consignee, Shrieve Chemical in The Woodlands, TX, was notified as was the Care of Party, Agrifos located in Pasadena, TX, both parties agreed to inspect other cars of the same type for similar wear and deterioration of the discharge pipe cap.

THE TRUCK HAD TRAVERSED A ""SPEED BUMP"" WHEN A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE LIQUID LEAKED FROM THE TRUCK AND CONTINUED FOR MANY MILES IN NOTICEABLE AMOUNT AS IT DRIED ON THE ROAD SURFACE.  LOCAL FIRE DEPT., COUNTY EMERGENCY MGT., NC DOT, AS WELL AS WATER GUARD INC. PERSONNEL RESPONDED WHEN NOTIFIED SEVERAL HOURS AFTER THE INITIAL RELEASE.  SODIUM BICARBONATE DRY AND IN SOLUTION WAS APPLIED TO NEUTRALIZED THE PRODUCT.  THE NC DOT USED A SPRAY TRUCK TO TREAT THE ROADWAY.  THE EMERGENCY PERSONNEL CLOSED US 264 AT THE INTERSECTION WITH MERCK DRIVE FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  EXAMINATION OF THE IBC REVEALED A CRACK ABOVE THE VALVE IN THE TANK BODY.  THE IBC WAS WITHIN ITS INSPECTION/TEST CYCEL AND DUE FOR TEST IN AUG 2009.  ADDITIONAL CLEANUP OF THE SANDOZ SITE WAS COMPLETED 04/23/2009.    FAILURE MODES AND FACTORS  IMMEDIATE CAUSE WAS A 27-INCH CRACK WITH A 1/4 INCH SEPARATION IN THE AREA BETWEEN TWO BASE ATTACHMENT POINTS AND AN AREA 4-6 INCHES ABOVE THE OUTLET VALVE.  THE BASE HAD SOME SIGNIFICANT FORKLIFT DAMAGE FROM USE AND APPARENTLY ALLOWED THE VALVE SUPPORT AREA TO FLEX WITHOUT SUPPORT.  THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION AND STRESS OF THE IBC AT THE SPEED BUMP EXCEEDED THE ELASTIC STRENGTH.

The vehicle was stopped and the support crew already at DRB/PS#9 was notified by security of the incident.  Upon the support crews' arrival at the vehicle, they noticed fluid leaking (Cortron RU-248) from numerous locations on the truck.  The security guard and one of the crew immediately started to place absorbentpads and containment. A hazard assessment was completed. Once initial notifications were made through the Alyeska Operations Control Center the area was secured, LEL readings were taken and initial clean-up was initiated.  4/24/2009: Immediate clean-up was accomplished by placing secondary containment under the vehicle at the leak points and absorbent pads were placed in and around the vehicle.  A VAC truck was used to collect the contained product.  Once the spill stopped leaking from the truck the containment was removed and the truck was towed on site and placed inside secondary containment.  4/25/2009: CASI Safety and crew started the initial investigation of the incident.  The tank was found to be empty.  A visual inspection of the valves indicated that they were closed at the time of the inspection. 999","The incident investigation is ongoing.Work procedures are being reviewed for adequacy and being re-written where necessary to include all critical tasks associated with the operation, including truck operation and transport.

Box 66033, MD 400",CHICAGO,IL,60666,Carrier,"At approximately 1300 on April 1st, 2009, a fleet service clerk brought a suitcase in to the bag room supervisor's office as he noticed strong fumes / vapors emitting from the suitcase. The supervisor (who is trained in spill response) donned PPE and opened the suitcase to investigate.  Inside she found several dental items including an empty 1 quart container of Sledgehammer Self-Cure Dental Acrylic Monomer.  The supervisor closed up the bag and moved it outside of her office as she was starting to get a headache from the fumes.      The supervisor contacted the Lead Environmental Coordinator for the station, Kim Galvin (myself).  I was able to retrieve an MSDS for the product from the manufacturer and determined the substance to be a hazardous material, flammable liquid, n.o.s., UN 1993.  The substance had not been declared or transported appropriately as a hazardous material.      The suitcase was wrapped in a plastic garbage bag to prevent release of the fumes to the employees working in the area.  It was then transported to our hazardous waste storage area.    I completed a hazardous materials report / notification to the FAA.  I then contacted FAA Hazardous Materials Specialist Christopher G. Zawarus at the Chicago Security Field Office.  Inspector Zawarus came out on April 8th, 2009 to view the material.  There were several items inside the bag...all related to dental practice...and all appeared to have been used.      We are unable to determine how much of the product may have been in the 1 quart container, however, the blanket and towels inside the suitcase were damp.  The outside of the suitcase was not, therefore it was determined that there was no release outside of the suitcase, other than the vapors emitting from the product.      The bag was checked in CLT, travelling through ORD on the way to final destination of MSP.    The passenger will be driving to ORD to pick up the bag in the near future.","Better education to the passenger is needed to ensure he does not check undeclared hazardous material in the future.  AA has several checks in place to attempt to educate our passengers as well as several ""triggers"" that cause our ticket agents to ask questions to passengers when travelling to help identify if they are travelling with hazardous items.
