WHEN HE STOPPED TO SLEEP, HE CHECKED THE LOAD AND AGAIN BEFORE HE STARTED DRIVING. ON APRIL 5TH, AS HE WAS COMING DOWN LOOKOUT PASS, ANOTHER TRUCK RADIOED HIM, SAYING THERE WAS LIQUID DRIPPING FROM UNDER HIS TRAILER.  AFTER CHECKING HIS MSDS'S AND SHIPPING PATERS, HE RADIOED THE HAUGEN SCALE FOR HELP.  THE SCALE APPARENTLY NOTIFIED THE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT AND A SHERIFF ARRIVED AT THE SCENE.  WATKINS AND SHEPARD WAS NOTIFIED BY THE MISSOULA HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT OF THE SPILL ABOUT 1:30 PM (MST).  A FIRE DEPARTMENT AND SHERIFF HAD THE TRUCK MOVED INTO THE REST AREA.  THE UNITS WERE PARKED ON A DOWNWARD SLOPING ASPHALT LOT.  A CURB, SAND, DELIVERED BY A SAND TRUCK AND FLOOR DRY WAS USED TO CONTAIN THE SPILL UNTIL THE HAZMAT TEAMS ARRIVED.  THE MISSOULA RURAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AGREED TO GO TO THE SCENE TO CONTAIN THE SPILL.  WE HAD A WATKINS SHEPARD DRIVER PICK UP A TOTE FROM STONE CONTAINER TO BRING TO THE SCENE HOPING TO TRANSFER THE LIQUID FROM THE LEAKING TOTE TO THE NEW ONE.  THE MISSOULA RURAL FIRE DEPARTMENT DETERMINED THE SPILL WAS LARGER THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT AND REQUIRED ADDITIONAL HELP.  ROAR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICE FROM SPOKANE WA. WAS CALLED TO HELP WITH CONTAINMENT AND CLEAN UP.  AFTER DETERMINING WHAT TOTE WAS LEAKING, MISSOULA RURAL FIRE DEPARTMENT CLOSED AND SECURED THE VALVE, STOPPING THE LEAK.  THE VALVE ON THE TOTE WAS NOT FULLY CLOSED AND DID NOT HAVE THE SAFETY CAP LATCHED DOWN OVER THE VALVE.  THIS ALLOWED LIQUID TO LEAK OUT.  THE LIQUID THAT WAS ON THE GROUND AND IN THE TRAILER WAS PUMPED INTO THE EXTRA TOTE.  ROAR CLEANED UP THE SAND AND LIQUID AND PLACED IT IN BARRELS, THEY CURRENTLY HAVE THE BARRELS AND WILL DISPOSE OF THEM.  A NEUTRALIZING AGENT WAS SPRAYED ON THE ASPHALT, THE TRAILER AND TRACTOR DURING THE CLEANUP.  WHEN THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER WAS RELEASED, THE DRIVER DELIVERED THE LOAD TO STONE AND RETURNED THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER TO OUR FACILITY IN MISSOULA WHERE THEY WERE THOROUGHLY CLEANED.  BOTH TOM WALTER AND MYSELF TALKED TO ED NEHAUS OF CALGON ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THE TOTE AND VALVE AND QUESTIONED WHY THE VALVE WAS NOT PROPERLY CLOSED AND SECURED.

AROUND 1300 THE JP4 JET FUEL STARTING LEAKING FROM THE CARGO TANK DUE TO A STRESS FRACTURE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE OF THE SEAMS LOCATED AT OR NEAR THE BOTTOM PORTION OF THE TANK. APPROXIMATELY 60 GALLONS OF AVIATION FUEL SPILLED FROM THE CARGO TANK. THE JP4 JET FUEL IS USED BY SRP FLIGHT OPERATIONS TO FUEL THE COMPANY HELICOPTER AT THE VARIOUS LOCATIONS WHILE PERFORMING WORK. THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A ROUGH RURAL ROAD. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE CONDITION OF THE ROAD CAUSED THE STRESS FRACTURE IN THE CARGO TANK. ACTIONS TAKEN AT THE TIME OF DISCOVERY INCLUDE DISPERSING THE LEAK OVER THE ROAD FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILES TO KEEP FROM COMPILING A CENCENTRATION OF FUEL UNTIL THE CREW COULD ARRANGE TO OFF LOAD THE REMAINING FUEL, THUS MINIMIZING ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE LOCATION WHERE A HELICOPTER COULD LAND, THE FUEL WAS UNLOADED DIRECTLY INTO SRP'S HELICOPETER. AT THE LOCATIONS WERE THE FUEL HAD SPILLED ON THE GROUND, SRP REMOVED THE SOIL AND PROPERLY DISPOSED OF THE SOIL UNDER ALL LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL EPA GUIDELINES. ALL NECESSARY EPA NOTIFICATIONS FOR SPILL RESPONSE WERE COMPLETED. PREVENTIVE ACTIONS IN THE FUTURE INCLUDE KEEPING PLUG-N-DIKE ON THE CARGO TANK. PLUG-N-DIKE IS A GREY PUTTY SUBSTANCE THAT WILL STOP A STRESS FRACTURE OR SMALL PUNCTURE IN A FUEL TANK WHILE IT IS LEAKING. PLUG-N-DIKE WILL BE USED TO STOP THE LEAK IMMEDIATELY UPON DISCOVERY.

HE STOPPED AT FABCO EQUIPMENT INC IN MARQUETTE MI TO GET THE TAILGATE FIXED. FABCO WAS NOT ABLE TO REPAIR THE GATE BUT ARRANGED FOR A GARAGE 3 MILES DOWN THE ROAD TO LOOK AT IT. AT THIS TIME THE MECHANIC AND OUR DRIVER DID NOTICE A DRIPPING OF CHEMICAL FROM THE TRAILER WHICH OUR DRIVER DETERMINED WAS BLEACH (10% SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE SOLUTION). OF COURSE, OUR DRIVER SHOULD HAVE DEALT WITH THE PROBLEM AT THIS TIME BUT BECAUSE THE TAILGATE WAS STUCK IN THE UP POSITION IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET INTO THE VAN, SO HE PROCEEDED TO THE LOCATION OF THE GARAGE, SOULLIERES MARATHON STATION. HE WAS PULLED OVER BY A PATROL CAR AS HE ENTERED THE STATION PROPERTY. SOMEONE HAD REPORTED THAT WE HAD A CHEMICAL LEAK, OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE FROM FABCO EQUIPMENT AS THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH OF A LEAK TO BE NOTICEABLE. THE OFFICER NOTED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS ON THE TRUCK AND IN SHORT ORDER OUR DRIVER LOST CONTROL OF THE SITUATION, AS POLICE, FIRE DEPT AND EMERGENCY GOVERNMENT PERSONAL TOOK OVER, WOULD NOT LET HIM OR ANYONE GET WITHIN 500 FEET OF THE TRUCK. THEY BECAME OVERLY CONCERNED AS OTHER HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS WERE ALSO ON THE TRUCK AT THE TIME. THESE INCLUDED 4 150# CYLINDERS OF SULFUR DIOXIDE GAS, 172 GALLONS OF MURIATIC ACID, 1070 GALLONS OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE SOLUTION (10%), 189 GALLONS OF TETRACHLOROETHYLENE, 750# OF CAUSTIC SODA BEADS, 50# OF BROMITE TABLETS, 5 GALLONS OF A CORROSIVE ACID CLEANER, AND ONE GALLON OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE. OUR DRIVER TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS BLEACH THAT WAS LEAKING AND THAT HE COULD CORRECT THE PROBLEM WITHIN MINUTES. OUR DRIVER DID HAVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SUPPLIES ON A CONTAINER BEHIND HIS TRACTOR WHICH ALSO CONTAINED A RESPIRATOR. HOWEVER, OUR DRIVER WAS NOT ALLOWED TO HANDLE THE PROBLEM AND WAS FORCED TO STAY 500 FEET FROM THE TRAILER. OUR HOME OFFICE WAS CALLED BY SOMEONE FROM THE SCENE, AND JIM CHERWINKA, PRESIDENT, GOT THE CALL. JIM WAS TOLD THAT FUMES WERE COMING FROM THE TRUCK AND THAT HAZMAT PERSONNEL WERE ON THE WAY. SOMETIME LATER JIM RECEIVED ANOTHER CALL AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO HAZMAT TEAM AND THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. A 5 GALLON PLASTIC CARBOY WAS PLACED INTO A 55 GALLON OPEN TOP DRUM TO CONTAIN THE LEAK. TOTAL LEAKAGE WAS ESTIMATED AT LESS THAN A GALLON. ON MONDAY, MAY 1ST, I OPENED THE 55 GALLON DRUM AND WEIGHED THE LEAKY 5 GALLON CARBOY AT 44.5 LBS. ORIGINAL WEIGHT IS 52 LBS. THE 10% BLEACH WEIGHTS 10 LB/GAL SO TOTAL LOSS EVEN 5 DAYS LATER WAS ONLY ABOUT 3 QUARTS. LEAK SITE LOSS WAS PROBABLY LESS THAN A QUART AND CERTAINLY LESS THAN TWO QUARTS. THE REASON FOR THIS REPORT IS THAT ON MAY 1ST I RECEIVED A COPY OF A NEWS ARTICLE FROM THE NAUGAUNEE AREA WHICH STATED THAT U.S. HIGHWAY 41 WAS CLOSED FOR SEVEN HOURS DUE TO THE SPILL, WHICH AS I UNDERSTAND THE REGULATIONS REQUIRES A REPORT.

WE THEN SPRAYED WATER ON THE TANK TO WARM IT, SO WE SOULD FINISH VENTING AS MUCH GAS AS POSSIBLE BEFORE THE UHP WOULD LET THE CRANE UPRIGHT THE TANK.  AT THIS TIME WE PUMPED OFF THE REST OF THE GAS AND FOUND THAT THE TANK WAS NOT CRACKED OR RUPTURED, BUT THE SPITTER GAUGE HAD BEEN DAMAGED AND WAS LEAKING.
