It was reported that the trailer was loaded for delivery and the driver noticed that there was material leaking from the trailer. The terminal personnel backed the trailer to the dock door and began unloading the freight. They found two 1 gallon pails of UN 1263 that had apparently been hit by a forklift.  The caller reported that the release had impacted the trailer floor, the apron and the loading dock. The caller stated that if they were allowed to clean the release, they would. The SDS was forwarded to the caller for their reference. The caller said that they would clean the release with granular absorbents and then place all used absorbents and impacted pails into a 55 gallon steel drum, label as non hazardous then place into OS&D. This release to the environment is not reportable at this time and no drains or water ways were reported to be impacted by this release. A DOT 5800 is required for this release due to the PGII of the material. Titan Entry was completed under number XKC - 015887.

The trailer was carrying 45,420 pounds of UN3082 Calsoft T-60.  The trailer was side swiped and rear ended by a passenger vehicle while in transit.  The tank body was dented along its passenger side near its middle and the rear bulk head was dented as well. There was no damage to any valves or outlet lines on the tanker and there was no release of any product.  The tractor and tanker were towed to a nearby wrecker service yard in order to transfer the product to  a relief tanker.  On 1/12/17, an environmental contractor was dispatched to perform the product transfer. The material was transferred into a DOT 407 relief tanker without incident.  The damaged tanker was then taken for repairs, testing and re-certification.",,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Emergency Response and Training Solutions,US,

Upon closer inspection by facility personnel wearing appropriate PPE, it was found that a drum was leaking from its lid gasket. The quantity of the leak was 8 ounces, all of which was released to the floor of the truck and side of the drum; none to soil, ground, or water. Further inspection revealed the drum ring, locking nut, and bungs to be properly tightened and torqued. The gasket was found to be misaligned in the drum ring. The drum head was replaced with another of correct type head, ring, and gasket. Facility personnel wearing appropriate PPE fully remediated the spill using absorbents and spills pads; the waste generated from the cleanup was placed in the appropriate branch waste stream container.","At the time the driver accepted the container for transportation, no evidence of leaking was observed. However, the driver was instructed to: 1) conduct a  thorough inspection of each container before acceptance 2) if any evidence of a reduction in structural integrity or improper closure is found to take appropriate action to either fix the closure issues or place the container into a suitable salvage drum or re-containerize before transportation is initiated. In addition, the shipper was advised of the incident and was requested to follow the manufacturers printed closure instructions carefully when closing drums, and to inspect all drums in current inventory for any containers with suspect closure or integrity issues.",No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc.,US,

ON THE MORNING OF JANUARY 9TH, THE DRIVER THAT WAS SCHEDULED TO DELIVER THE LOAD HOOKED UP TO THE TRAILER AND PROCEEDED OUT OF THE LANGER YARD. AS HE WAS SCHEDULED TO DELIVER THE LOAD HOOKED UP TO THE TRAILER AND PROCEEDED OUT OF THE LANGER YARD. AS HE WAS GETTING ONTO THE HIGHWAY THE TRAILER DISCONNECTED FORM THE TRACTOR AND FELL ON IT LANDING GEAR. THE WEIGHT OF THE TRAILER CAUSED THE LANDING GEAR TO COLLAPSE AND A BOLT THAT WAS PART OF THE LANDING GEAR PUNCTURED THE BARREL OF THE TRAILER. THE BOLT CAUSED A SMALL PUNCTURE BUT DID NOT GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BARREL OF THE TRAILER.     THE DRIVE GOT OUT OF HIS TRACTOR, ASSESSED THE SITUATION AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT DRIPPING OUT OF THE TRAILER. THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY TOOK OUT HIS SPILL KIT AND PUT ABSORBENT PADS AND PLACED A BUCKET UNDERNEATH THE DRIP. HE THEN WENT BACK TO THE OFFICE AND REPORTED WHAT HAPPENED AND WE CALLED THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES.     SINCE THE INCIDENT HAPPENED DIRECTLY IN FROM OF LANGER TRANSPORT WE WERE ABLE TO REACT FAST AND HAD OUT IN HOUSE RESPONDENTS PLUG UP THE HOLE AND SPREAD SPEEDY DRY ON THE SPORTS WHERE THE PRODUCT HIT THE GROUND. WHILE THE LEAK WAS BEING CONTAINED WE TRANSLOADED THE SHIPMENT INTO ANOTHER TRAILER. WHEN THE PROCESS WAS COMPLETE THE DAMAGE TRAILER WAS TOWED BACK INTO THE LANGER YARD.",THE INITIAL INCIDENT OF THE TRAILER SEPARATING FORM THE TRACTOR OCCURRED DUE TO DRIVER ERROR. THE DRIVER FAILED TO VISUALLY INSPECT HIS FIFTH WHEEL AND ENSURE THAT THE JAWS OF THE FIFTH WHEEL WERE WRAPPED AROUND THE KINGPIN OF THE TRAILER. THIS IS A MAJOR VIOLATION OF COMPANY POLICY THAT IS COVERED DURING THE TRAINING PROCESS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE THIS PROCEDURE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF IT.     IN REGARDS TO THE TRAILER LEAKING THE DRIVER DID EVERYTHING HE WAS TRAINED TO DO. HE IMMEDIATELY CONTAINED THE LEAK BY USING HIS SPILL KIT THAT WAS SUPPLIED TO HIM.

Air monitor readings confirmed that there was a vapor release coming from the top of the tank car.     Three out of six manway hinged swing bolts were found less than tool tight. Securing the three bolts did not stop the release. The manway gasket was then inspected with no obvious defects found. The gasket, nozzle, and cover were all wiped clean of debris and then re-secured. This did not stop the vapor release.     A new gasket was installed using PTFE joint sealant material and the manway re-secured, stopping the vapor release. Air monitoring was preformed for 20 minutes after securement with no findings.

The accident caused the trailer to over turn on its side. The trailer was carrying (19) 1,000 kilogram plastic lined and plastic wrapped fiberboard gaylords of UN1689 sodium cyanide briquettes. The IBC containers and their lids were banded to the pallets on which they were loaded.  The accident caused the roof of the trailer to be torn open causing 12 of the 19 IBC containers to be released to the roadway and soil median.  The accident caused the lids of (6) of the IBCs to come off and release approximately 100 pounds of briquettes to the soil median.  No drains or waterways were impacted the release.  Due to the accident I-40 in both directions was shut down at approximately 0830 EST/0730 CST. I-40 east bound was closed for approximately 2 hours and I-40 west bound was completely closed for approximately 6 hours. The West Memphis, AR fire department initially responded to the release and secured the area. ERTS dispatched United States Environmental Service(USES) of Memphis, TN to respond to the release and perform clean up activities.  Due to the fact the a federal RQ was met (more than 1 pound of sodium cyanide was released to the environment) and that I-40 was closed due to the release, the NRC was notified and report number 1169902 was issued. USES personnel utilized a long reach fork lift and mini excavator to upright and load all undamaged IBCs onto a relief trailer.  The IBCs in which the lids had came off were re-secured with lids and banded back onto pallets. The re-secured IBCs were then loaded onto the relief trailer.  All spilled material was collected with the use of a vacuum truck and were stored in a vacuum box to avoid exposure to moisture. The re-secured IBCs and vacuum box of spilled material were transported back the Chemours Company in Memphis,TN for salvaging.  An approximate 20'x50' area of soil median was excavated to ensure that all spilled material had been collected.  Approximately 10 yards of impacted soil was taken offsite for disposal by USES personnel in a roll off box.    On 2/1/17 USES personnel returned to site to ensure that all spilled material had been collected.

Due to the accident the lids of (6) 60 pound steel pails of UN1807 phosphoric anhydride came loose/were damaged causing the release of approximately 2 pounds of material to the trailer floor/wall.  The release was contained to the trailer and no soils, drains or waterways were impacted.  An environmental contractor was dispatched to respond to the release.  The damaged pails and spilled material were containerized into 55 gallon poly drums and transported to the XPO Logistics facility in Knoxville, TN by the contractor.  The trailer was uprighted and transported back to the Knoxville XPO facility for further clean up.  At the terminal it was determined that due to damaged suffered in the accident, an additional 7 pails needed to be over packed. In total, (13) 60 pound pails of the material were overpacked and held onsite for XPO personnel to manage.

The trailer was pre-loaded at the shipper and not supervised by the driver. Driver was fueling his truck when he noticed a small amount of liquid on his left side drive tires.  Driver completing fueling process and pulled to an area free of the fuel pumps, apx 200 feet away, and placed a spill pad on his drive tires to prevent leakage from hitting the ground.  Most of the material that was leaked was contained to the inside of the vehicle.  It was later determined that there was a small pin hole in the lower portion of the metal drum.  There is no telling how long the pin-hole leaked but it is judged to be from the point of loading until the point of being overpacked by the clean-up crew.  We do not know how long the drum had been on the trailer before our driver hooked to the trailer a couple of hours before the leak was discovered.  The spilled material was absorbed  with oil dry and the trailer clean, the leaking package wsa over-packed into a larger plastic drum",The best way to of prevented this spill would have been for the shipper to take greater care to inspect packages at the time it was loaded onto the trailer.  Training  or instituting a step by step for inspecting and loading the drum onto pallets or the trailer floors would prevent many of this type leak.  It is believed that the shipper was slack in inspecting the containers before they were  loaded.,No,DRUM,"Drum - fiber, metal or plastic not specified",DRUM,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2500,"Robbie D Wood, inc",US,

This leak was noticed by the Brewster Yard Car Inspector and then reported to the Brewster Yard Master.  He then notified me. When I got there to investigate I found that this car was not leaking.  The next car west, UTLX 5159 was leaking.  This car was leaking from the liquid valve on the A end.  I tried to tighten the valve to get the leak to stop but it would not.  I cracked the valve open and tried to reseal but only made it worse.  I was able to tighten the valve plug and get the leak to stop but the valve is still defective and the car will need tran-loaded.  I had the yardmaster shop the car and set to 4 new car shop.  Emergency Response Contractor Sunpro was called in the next day to look at the car.  They transferred the car and then flared the car off so that the valve could be replaced.  The valve was then replaced and the car bubble tested to 40 pounds with Nitrogen.  The bubble leak test passed and the car was released for service with the Nitrogen blanket remaining on the car.",Better car securement procedures need followed.,No,TANK CAR,,112J400W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8000,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

Inspection of the car revealed the A end liquid angle plug valve to be closed and the securement plug in position wrench tight with product leaking from the threaded plug.  Plug was partially unthreaded so that pipe sealant could be applied.  Plug was tightened back into place with no signs of further leakage.  With the valve closed, product was then noted leaking from the valve stem packing gland nut. The nut was loosened, and additional Teflon packing was added to the valve stem.  The packing gland nut was retightened which secured the car from further release.  Due to a faulty valve, on 1-11-17 product from car UTLX 951233 was transloaded into tank car UTLX 951242 at the Alexander Railyard.  Upon completion of the transfer, car was placed back into transportation and car UTLX 951233 was home shopped for further repairs.","Conduct proper pre and post inspection of car upon completion of loading or unloading, to ensure all valves, fittings and closures are in a closed and secure condition preventing release of liquid, vapor or gas while car is in transportation.",No,TANK CAR,Pressure,112J,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,21120,Union Pacific Railroad,US,

At Sioux Falls, flatbed was slid off truck using articulating arm and set on ground to conduct other work.  Freezing rain that night created ice on flatbed.  Next morning flatbed was slid up on truck with articulating arm. One pallet of batteries slid down removable flatbed as it was being pulled up on to the truck and hit the ground.  Eight batteries broke/cracked releasing about 12 gallons of sulfuric acid on to ground.  Baking soda used to neutralize acid.  Broken batteries and rock/soil (approximately 4 cubic feet - 2' x3' x 8"") were placed into 3 poly drums (1 drum for rock/soil and two drums for broken batteries).  Sample of rock/soil was collected and is being tested for lead to determine proper disposal.  Once results are received the containerized material will be sent to Xcel's Chestnut facility for proper disposal",Discuss incident in future training events.

Their tractor broke down on the trip and they swapped it out for a spare.  The driver began to pump the fuel off the truck as normal or so he thought.  It turns out the hydraulics between tractors were the direct opposite.  So rather than pumping fuel off the truck, the driver was sucking fuel from the tank back onto the truck.  The compartment on the truck filled and discharged fuel out of the vent ports.  The driver promptly shut down the pump, but we calculated 96 gallons of fuel was discharged onto the ground.  GNP utilized spill kits and wood shavings in an effort to absorb the spill.  It was a warm day with a lot of snowmelt, so the discharge spread rather rapidly.  Glen Winter, Owner of Land O Lakes notified the MPCA duty officer of the discharge, case # 163822.  West Central Environmental Consultants were contacted to handle the cleanup.  They were on site 1/19/17 as well as 1/20/17.  They collected fuel soaked shavings as well as some soil and have it stored in a lined roll off container.

Ethanol, leaking from the top of the car.  The car was isolated and the shipper, Koch Supply and Trading Company, the Florida State Watch Office (report number 2017-958), and the NRC (report number 1169921) were notified.  CHEMTREC report number  2017-01-31-00166).  Hulls Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the car to have eight of eight manway bolts less than tool tight.  The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper (Shamryn Holzwarth, phone number 316-828-7348).  Contractor personnel tightened the manway bolts and noted the product had a vapor release.  The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.  This incident did not require a special switching move or a 7.1.     The shipper on the waybill is listed as Koch Supply and Trading Company.  The car was unloaded and released into transportation by TRANSFLO / Arrow Material Services (Contact Tim Moore 813-294-9926).

In the process of unloading the driver used the veeder root fuel management system on site (computer system) to determine that fuel would fit into the two diesel fuel tanks. He approximated the split amount that would need to go into the two tanks. After dropping the fuel into the first tank he then started to drop fuel into the second tank. After dropping the fuel into the second tank fuel came back out the open port on the first tank allowing approx 20 gallons to bubble out onto the pavement and then the fuel ran toward a storm drain. A small amount of fuel dribbled into the catch basin of the storm sewer. The driver put down pads to keep any more fuel from going into the storm sewer and called dispatch office for assistance. Fire Dept responded until outside environmental contractor could respond to complete clean-up. Actual fuel spill lasted approx 3 minutes. Scene was cleaned up within approx 3 hours.

THIS CAUSED THE DRUMS TO BE WET. THE CONTAINERS WERE LOADED WITH A PALLET JACK ONTO A HERITAGE TRANSPORT, LLC SHORT RUCK AND DELIVERED TO THE 10 DAY TRANSFER FACILITY WHERE THEY REMAINED ON THE VEHICLE UNTIL MONDAY 1/16/2017. AN EMPLOYEE OFFLOADED THE CONTAINERS FROM THE VEHICLE AND STAGED THE CONTAINERS ON A CONCRETE FLOOR INSIDE THE 10 DAY TRANSFER WAREHOUSE, THAT MORNING (AT APPROXIMATELY 08:00) TO CHECK THE CONTAINERS, APPLY COMPANY BAR CODES AND PREFORM INTERNAL COMPANY PROCEDURES FOR THE CONTAINERS TO TRANSFER TO THE DESTINATION FACILITY. WHILE THE CONTAINERS WHERE STAGED IN THE WAREHOUSE, EMPLOYEE 2 OBSERVED (AT APPROXIMATELY 08:30) THAT ONE OF THE 55 1A1 CONTAINERS HAD BEGUN TO LEAK. APPROXIMATELY 1 GALLON OF MATERIAL LEAKED ONTO THE CONCRETE FLOOR INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE BUILDING. EMPLOYEE 2 OBSERVING THE LEAK FORM THE CONTAINER NOTIFIED EMPLOYEE 1 WHO RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY WITH A SPILL KIT AND SUPPLIES. EMPLOYEE 1 USED A BAG OF VERMICULITE TO ABSORBED THE MATERIAL ON THE CONCRETE FLOOR, WHILE EMPLOYEE 2 STAGED AN OVER PACK CONTAINER (85 GALLON 1A1) INTO PLACE. BEFORE OVER PACKING THE CONTAINER, EMPLOYEE 1 WAS ABLE TO SPECULATE THAT THE LEAK APPEARED TO BE A PIN HOLE ON A WELD LOCATED AT THE BASE OF THE CONTAINER. USING A DRUM SLING AND FORKLIFT, THE TWO EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY OVER PACKED THE LEAKING CONTAINER. THE VERMICULITE MATERIAL WAS THEN SWEPT UP AND PLACED INTO THE SAME OVER PACK CONTAINER WHICH WAS THEN SEALED AND CLOSED.     ON WEDNESDAY JANUARY 18 2017 AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 EMPLOYEE 1 WAS INSPECTING THE CONTAINERS PICKED UP ON JANUARY 13, 2017.

THERE WERE REPORTS OF AN AMMONIA SMELL AND A RELEASE WAS EXPECTED TO BE COMING FROM TRAIN N12 CONTAINING SEVERAL RESIDUE CARS OF UN1005 ANHYDROUS AMMONIA. THE TOTAL CAPACITY OF EACH CAR WAS 129,575 LITERS AND THE EXACT AMOUNT RELEASED IS UNKNOWN. IHR RESPONDED WITH 4 MEMBERS AND TR722 HAZMAT TRAILER. UPON ARRIVAL, CP’S DIESEL LOCOMOTIVE SHOP HAD BEEN EVACUATED AS A PRECAUTION. CALGARY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON SCENE WITH ONE HAZMAT RIG AND ONE ENGINE, ERAP NUMBER WAS CALLED TO NOTIFY PRE ASSESSMENT AND NOTED THAT ERAP NUMBER WAS NOT VALID. CP DGO CONTACTED CANUTEC TO ADVISE AND REQUEST MSDS. A SAFETY BRIEFING WAS HELD AND A PLAN WAS MADE TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE. D RITTER AND B.

FOSTER WERE STAGED UPWIND IN THE COLD ZONE AS A RAPID INTERVENTION TEAM IF NECESSARY. THE FIRST CAR THAT WAS SIZED UP WAS TILX500966 AND A READING OF 25 PPM WAS DOCUMENTED ON THE GROUND. MONITORING EQUIPMENT REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF AMMONIA ORIGINATING FROM THE PROTECTIVE HOUSING AT 100 PPM. THE HOUSING WAS OPENED AND IT WAS FOUND WITH LOOSE PLUGS ON THE LIQUID AND VAPOUR VALVES AND BOTH VALVES WERE GIVEN AN EIGHTH OF A TURN TO TIGHTEN. AFTER MONITORING THE HOUSING FOR SEVERAL MINUTES THE LEVELS DROPPED TO 40 PPM. TEAMS MOVED TO THE NEXT CAR (TILX500797) AND A READING OF 500PPM WAS FOUND ON THE GROUND. AFTER CLIMBING THE TANK CAR MONITORING EQUIPMENT ALSO REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF AMMONIA COMING FROM THE PROTECTIVE HOUSING. THIS TIME THE LEVELS WERE “OVER RANGE”.","THE HOUSING WAS OPENED AND IT WAS ALSO FOUND WITH LOOSE PLUGS ON THE LIQUID AND VAPOUR VALVES. THE VAPOUR VALVE WAS GIVEN A HALF TURN TO TIGHTEN AND IS BELIEVED TO BE THE LARGEST CAUSE OF THE RELEASE. MONITORING ON TILX500797 CONTINUED AS TEAMS MOVED TO THE NEXT CAR (TILX500802). A READING OF 20 PPM WAS FOUND ON THE GROUND AND THE TOP OF THE CAR WAS CLEAR OF ANY AMMONIA READINGS WITH ALL FITTINGS AND VALVES FOUND CLOSED AND TIGHT. TILX500797 CONTINUED TO PRODUCE READINGS. AT THAT TIME, LOW AIR ALARMS BEGAN TO GO OFF AND ALL TEAMS PULLED BACK TO THE INCIDENT COMMAND LOCATION FOR NEW BOTTLES AND TO DISCUSS FURTHER ACTIONS. UPON RECEIVING CONTACT BY CUSTOMERS EMERGENCY COORDINATOR WE RECEIVED TECHNICAL ADVICE AND A MSDS. THE EMERGENCY NUMBER IS A COOPERATIVE PLAN HELD BETWEEN ORICA AND CANADIAN FERTILIZER. A SOCKET SET WOULD ALSO BE USED TO TIGHTEN ANY LOOSE FLANGE BOLTS ON THE VALVE PACKING. AFTER RE-ENTERING AND COMPLETING THIS TASK THE AMMONIA LEVELS BEGAN TO DROP AND TEAMS AGAIN LEFT THE HOT ZONE. LEVELS ON THE GROUND ADJACENT TO TILX500797 WERE LOWERED TO 25PPM AND 140 PPM WAS RECORDED AT THE HOUSING.
