THIS WAS CAUSED 1. BY THE OBJECT BEING OF A ROUND NATURE ALLOWING IT TO ROLL. 2. THE CURTAINS IN THE BAGGAGE CART WERE NOT A BLE TO BE CLOSED COMPLETELY DUE TO MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION.  AFTER REALIZING THAT A RADIOACTIVE SHIPMENT WAS INVOLVED, THE ST. LOUIS AIRPORT FIRE DEPAR TMENT AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS WERE CALLED FOR.  CHEMTREC WAS CALLED AND THEY ADVISED TO CALL THE ATOMIC ENERGY AFFICE IN OAK RIDGE, TENN. WITH THE INFOR MATION PROVIDED ON THE AIR WAYBILL, IT WAS ADVISED THAT A 10 FOOT CLEARANCE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT.  THAT GATE AREA AND THE ADJOINING DOWNWIND GATE AREA WERE CLOSED AND EVACUATED. RDIOLOGICAL EMERGENCY PLANNER WAS NOTIFIED. THEY ADVISED TO HAVE A GEIGER COUNTER READING BEFORE MOVING THE SHIPMENT OR CLE ARING THE AREA. A ROBERT HORNSBY OF THE ST.
