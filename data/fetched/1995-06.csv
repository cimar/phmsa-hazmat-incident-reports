THE SPILLED MATERIAL WAS CONTAINED, AND CLEANED UP BY EMC OF FORT WORTH, TEXAS.  THE REMAINING PRODUCT WAS TRANSFERRED TO RECOVERY DRUMS.  THE ORIGINAL NET WEIGHT IN THE TANK WAS 2,820 POUNDS.  ABOUT 2,740 POUNDS OF PRODUCT WAS RECOVERED.  THE NET LOSS WAS ABOUT 80 POUNDS (OR 16 POUNDS OF HYDROFLUORIC ACID WHICH IS LESS THAN THE 100 POUND REPORTABLE QUANTITY FOR HYDROFLUORIC ACID).

A MARINE SURVEYOR REPRESENTING THE UNDERWRITERS FOR THE SHIPPER WAS ON SITE FOR THE TRANSLOAD OPERATION. TWO DAMAGED 55 GALLON DRUMS WERE LOCATED ON THE TOP LEVEL OF THE DOUBLE STACKED LOAD. ONE HAD BEEN CREASED IN THE SIDE JUST BELOW THE TOP CHIME, RESULTING IN A FIVE INCH LONG OPENING. THE SECOND LEVEL OF DRUMS WERE ON PALLETS, WITH NO SECUREMENT TO THE INDIVIDUAL PALLET. THE DRUM ADJACENT TO THE FIRST DAMAGED DRUM WAS OFF SET APPROXIMATELY ONE HALF INCH, WHICH ALLOWED THE TOP CHIME TO CONTINOUSLY RUB AGAINST THE DAMAGED DRUM DURING TRANSIT. THE SECOND DAMAGED DRUM WAS ALSO LOCATED ON THE TOP STACK. IT HAD SUSTAINED DAMAGE TO THE LOWER ROLLING HOOP FROM AN ADJACENT DRUM RUBBING AGAINST IT DURING TRANSIT. BOTH DRUMS WERE PLACED INTO OVERPACKS TO SECURE. AN ADDITIONAL DOZEN DRUM WERE LOCATED THAT WERE IN SUCH POOR CONDITION, THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO OVERPACK THESE DRUMS ALSO. A MAJORITY OF THE DRUMS IN THIS SHIPMENT WERE RECONDITIONED, HOWEVER, THE DRUMS WERE IN SUCH POOR CONDITION, THE INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR RECONDITIONED DRUMS WAS NOT LEGIBLE, THEREFORE, NOT RECORDED. THE CONTENTS WERE TRANSLOADED INTO A SECOND CONTAINER, MOLU288218, WHERE THEY WERE PROPERLY BLOCKED AND BRACED FOR MOVEMENT ONTO THE CONSIGNEE.

COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS NOTIFIED BY ITS RAMP PERSONNEL THAT A CONTAINER WAS NOTED LEAKING WHAT APPEARED TO BE PAINT, WHILE IN THE EAST YARD INTERMODAL FACILITY. MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE FACILITY, INSPECTED THE CONTAINER, AND DEVELOPED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE FROM THE LADING OF PAINT, WHICH WAS CONTAINED IN VARIOUS SIZED DRUMS AND PAILS. THE ENTIRE LADING WAS JUMBLED WITHIN THE CONTAINER. ALL OF THE VARIOUS SIZED DRUMS HAD BEEN PLACED ONTO PALLETS WITHOUT SECURING THE DRUMS TO THE PALLETS. THE ONLY SECUREMENT WAS A SINGLE PLASTIC BAND AROUND THE MIDSECTION OF THE DRUMS SITUATED ON EACH PALLET. IN EVERY CASE THE PLASTIC BAND HAD BEEN STRETCHED FROM THE DRUMS ""DANCING"" DURING TRANSIT AND WERE LAYING AT THE BASE OF THE DRUMS ON THE PALLET, THUS PROVIDING NO SECUREMENT. THE LOAD HAD BEEN SECURED AT THE REAR OF THE CONTAINER WITH TWO EACH, 2X4'S PLACED ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE CONTAINER. THERE WAS A SECOND LAYER OF FOUR PALLETS CONTAINING 30 GALLON DRUMS ON TOP OF THE FLOOR LEVEL DRUMS, IN THE FOREWARD NOSE OF THE CONTAINER. OF THE TWO 2X4'S THAT HAD BEEN PLACED ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE CONTAINER TO SECURE THE SECOND LEVEL DRUMS ONE HAD BROKEN NEAR THE CENTER AT A KNOT HOLE AND WAS LAYING IN TWO PIECES. THE OTHER HAD FALLEN AND WAS LAYING ON TOP OF THE FLOOR LEVEL DRUMS. ONCE THE PLASTIC BAND LOOSENED, THE DRUMS TOPPLED ONTO THE FLOOR LEVEL DRUMS. THE FIRST DAMAGED DRUM RELEASED ALL OF IT'S CONTENTS FROM TWO TEARS IN THE ROLLING HOOPS, SUSTAINED FROM IMPACTS WITH THE TOP CHIMES OF THE FLOOR LEVEL DRUMS. THE SECOND DRUM SUSTAINED DAMAGE FROM WHAT IS BELIEVED TO BE AN IMPACT WITH A RING CLOSURE BOLT FROM ONE OF THE FLOOR LEVEL DRUMS. THE IMPACT CAUSED A SMALL CRACK ON THE INSIDE BOTTOM CHIME, AND RESULTED IN LESS THAN A TWO GALLON RELEASE. THE ENTIRE LADING WAS REMOVED FROM THE CONTAINER IN ORDER TO INSPECT EACH DRUM. WHILE 95% OF THE LADING SHOWED SIGNS OF SEVERE METAL FATIGUE FROM RUBBING AGAINST OTHER ADJACENT DRUMS, ONLY THE TWO 30 GALLON DRUMS WERE FOUND TO HAVE RELEASED THEIR CONTENTS. THE DRUMS WERE RECOOPED ON PALLETS, STRETCH WRAPPED TO PREVENT MOVEMENT, AND RELOADED INTO TRAILER MPZ253410 FOR DELIVERY TO THE CONSIGNEE. AS THERE WAS NO BLOCKING BETWEEN THE PALLETS ON THE FLOOR TO PREVENT MOVEMENT, AND ONLY A SINGLE PLASTIC BAND AROUND THE DRUMS, AND NO ATTACHMENT OF THE DRUMS TO THE PALLETS, THE ENTIRE FLOOR LOAD MOVED WITHIN THE CONTAINER DURING TRANSIT. THIS MOVEMENT AFFECTED THE BRACING OF THE SECOND LEVEL LADING, WHICH WAS ALSO MISSING PLYWOOD SHEETS TO SEPARATE THE TWO LEVELS, WHICH ADDED TO THE FORCES ALLOWING THE DRUMS TO BREAK LOOSE AND TOPPLE.

IN ORDER FOR BULLOCKS TO TOW THE TRACTOR IT HAD TO BE UNHOOKED FROM THE SEMI.

THIS CAUSED THE TRAILER TO BE UNDER SOME TORQUE. WHEN UNIT 246 WAS PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THE TRAILER, THE INDUCED TORQUE, COMBINED WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE LOAD, CAUSED THE LANDING GEAR TO COLLAPSE ALLOWING THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER TO FALL TO THE HIGHWAY.
