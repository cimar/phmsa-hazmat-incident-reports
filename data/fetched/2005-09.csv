Our driver said he came off the roadway slightly with one wheel and lost control of his rig and rolled over.  His truck hit a Swift truck as it went over.  No injuries to anyone at the scene.    State Troopers at the scene called in Protech Environmental.  We additionally called in HMHTTC to assist.  At that time I was told only about a gallon of material had leaked out.  The ocean container carried about 14 totes of UN1268 and 6 totes of a non-regulated material.    A second truck was dispatched to the scene and the material was transloaded into the other truck.  This moring I was told by Protech that a 285 gallon tote was empty, HMTTC said one tote was 2/3 empty.  Still unsure of exact amount.  None of the material went into the drainage system though.    The accident caused the 10 freeway to be shut down for about 5 hours.","I'm told our driver was cited for speeding.  Obviously this is a driver error.  He is a relitively new driver for us (July 2005).  Checked his MVR that was ran before hiring, and he has one prior speeding in 2003.  MVR does not indicate whether it was in a car or truck.  Other than that the MVR is clean.     If we keep this driver will go through extensive training on speed and a ban from handling hazmat loads.

According to original stick readings total amount should have fit so the driver assumed that the fill tank was vapor locked.  The driver attempted to release the pressure in the hose by re-connecting the drop fitting but forgot to shut off the product flow valves. When the driver disconnected the drop fitting with product valves open she lost control of the hose and gasoline ran out of the hose onto the ground.  She first tried to re-connect the fitting and then when back to the trailer to shut off the flow.  Approximately 290 gallons were released. The driver then contacted dispatch and response crews were notified immediately.,This incident has been shared with our transportation staff and our customer partner to help us understand how to mitigate similar events in the future.  Company wide safety meetings have been conducted to re-iterate the importance of following established procedures.

The top pallet shifted and the pails fell off. 4 pails had their lids damage or knocked loose causing the paint to spill out.

On September 6, 2005 tanker #364 was spotted in the loading area to be filled with sodium hypochlorite (12.5% solution).  The loading operation began and approximately 10-15 minutes later, an employee noticed a release through an open valve.  He immediately closed the tanker unloading valve to stop flow out of tanker and notified management of the release.  The process line to the tanker was also closed.  Univar Contingency Plans were activated and responders notified. Spill occurred @ 9:30am on September 06, 2005 and duration of the release is estimated at approximately 10-15 minutes. An estimated total of 1,000 gallons (9,984 lbs) of bleach was released from the tanker.       About 100 gallons of the material released into an onsite storm water drainage ditch (land) that was dry. An earthen dike was dug at the ditch to prevent escape off-site.  All of the bleach and water in the ditch was collected via sump pump for management. The bleach in containment area was also captured and pumped into a storage tank.  Driveway and concrete storage pad was washed by Univar responders.  Clean water was introduced upstream of release to flush out residue.  All residue and water was pumped into Intermediate Bulk Containers and was neutralized.  Ohio EPA was onsite to monitor the response.","Employee training completed by 9/27/2005 to ensure that all operators inspect valves to make sure they are closed on tankers before the loading process begins.      Employee training completed by 9/27/2005 that all drivers instructed to make sure that after a tanker is washed, all valves (internal and external) are closed to lessen the chance of a spill when it is loaded.

The crew arrived on site and cleaned up the spilled material (20 gallons) and packed it into a drum.  The source of the leak, a cracked valve was sealed with epoxy.  JHM checked with several cartage houses in the area to see if we could use their space to upright the tote. They all refused.  A decision was made to send the trailer to Jevic’s West Chester, OH facility.    Once the trailer arrived at the facility, the tote began leaking again.  JHM called Environmental Enterprises (EE) to send a crew and transfer the remaining contents of the tote. The trailer was sent to EE to be decontaminated.

While parked at a rest area after offloading his load, the Werner Enterprises driver observed a small amount of adhesive leaking onto the asphalt from the rear discharge line of the tanker.  Werner contacted American Compliance Technologies at approximately 1600 CST and requested dispatch of an Emergency Response Team to the site.  Mr. Dan McCarty of Environmental Solutions Inc. (ESI) mobilized to the site and observed approximately 1 gallon of material on the asphalt.  The adhesive was removed from the ground and placed in a 30-gallon poly drum.  The drum was placed under the leaking line.  The cam lock cap was removed from the discharge line and approximately 1 ½ gallons of product remaining in the discharge line drained into the drum.  The gasket was missing from the cam lock cap and the external discharge valve had not completely seated, possibly due to a buildup of adhesive.  The internal valve was holding.  ESI fabricated a gasket and resecured the external discharge valve and the cam lock cap.  The material collected in the drum was solidified and disposed.",Drivers will be reminded to check all caps during placement for proper gaskets.

THIS VALVE HAD RECENTLY BEEN REPAIRED, BUT THERE WAS INDICATION THAT A PROBLEM REMAINED.  THE DRIVER CONTACTED HIS TERMINAL MANAGER, WHO ADVISED HIM TO WAIT UNTIL HE COULD CALL THE CUSTOMER'S ENGINEER TO DETERMINE WHAT HE WOULD SUGGEST.  THERE WERE NO VISIBLE LEAKS AT THIS TIME.  OUR DRIVER ANTICIPATED THAT THERE MAYBE A PROBLEM UNLOADING AT THE CUSTOMER IN FRESNO, CALIFORNIA, SO HE WANTED TO SEE IF HE WOULD NEED TO TAKE THE TRAILER IN FOR REPAIRS.  HE DID NOT WANT TO ARRIVE AT THE CUSTOMER AND NOT BE ABLE TO DELIVER.  THE DRIVER CONTACTED THE CUSTOMER'S ENGINEER, WHO ADVISED THE DRIVER TO INSPECT AND REPAIR THE VALVE.  WHICH OUR DRIVER PROCEEDED TO DO.  DURING THE PROCEDURE OUR DRIVER NOTICED THAT THERE WAS PRESSURE AND TOLD THE ENGINEER, WHO TOLD HIM THAT THERE WASN'T MUCH, SO OUR DRIVER CONTINUED.  OUR DRIVER NOTICED LIQUID AND ADVISED THE ENGINEER.  THE ENGINEER STATED THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE LIQUID THERE AS THIS IS A BALL VALVE.  OUR DRIVER CONTINUED AND THE STEM POPPED OFF FILLING THE AREA WITH LIQUID.  THE DRIVER BACKED AWAY THINKING IT WOUDL SLOW AND HE WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO PUT THE VALVE STEM BACK IN.  WHILE HE WAS STANDING BACK HE KNEW IT WAS NOT GOING TO STOP UNLESS HE WAS ABLE TO PUT THE VALVE STEM BACK IN PLACE AND AT THIS TIME A PERSON WORKING FOR THE TIRE REPAIR BUSINESS AT THIS LOCATIONS CAME FROM THE TRUCK STOP AND ASKED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND ASKED IF HE SHOULD CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THE DRIVER AGREED THAT HE SHOULD DO THAT.  WHEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED THE DRIVER MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO OPEN THE VALVE TO THE VENT STACK TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE SO HE COULD PUT THE VALVE BACK IN PLACE AND THE LEAK WOULD STOP.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PROCEDURES WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO GO NEAR THE TRAILER.  WHEN HAD AN EMPTY TRAILER ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 8:30 PST TO TRANSFER THE PRODUCT.  THE WORSE CASE WAS TO VENT THE GAS FROM THE TRAILER INTO THE EMPTY TRAILER TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE SO WE COULD PUT THE VALVE BACK TOGETHER ON THE LIQUID SIDE.  FIRE DEPARTMENT PROCEDURES WOULD NOT ALLOW THIS TO BE DONE.  EVERYONE WAS MOVED BACK AWAY FROM THE EQUIPMENT.  THE EMERGENCY CREW MUST HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING AN ACTION PLAN AND APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR LATER THE FIREMEN WERE CHECKING THE AIR QUALITY, FIRST UPWIND AND PLACED CONES DOWN APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET FROM OUR EQUIPMENT.  THEY THEN WALKED DOWN WIND AND WERE APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET AWAY NEAR SOME PARKED CARS.  OUR DRIVER SAID THEY JUST GOT BEHIND THE PARKED CARS AND BENT DOWN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE NOTICED THE FLAME HEADING TOWARDS THE TRAILER.  EVERYONE WAS THEN TOLD TO LEAVE THE AREA.  IS IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT A SPARK WAS GENERATED BY ONE OF THE FIREMEN, WHICH RESULTED IN THE TRAILER CATCHING FIRE.  THE TRAILER BURNED FOR TWO FULL DAYS PRIOR TO THE PRODUCT BURNING OUT.  THE FLAMES WERE AT VALVE PORT WHERE THE STEM WAS MISSING AND",DISCUSSIONS ARE BEING HELD WITH ALL DRIVERS TO REMIND THEM OF THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT ATTEMPTING TO MAKE ANY ROAD REPAIRS.

DURING THE BUCKET TEST, AN INTERNAL VALVE ON THE TANK LEAKED WHICH RESULTED IN THE 5-GALLON BUCKET USED FOR TESTING TO OVERFLOW.  THE INCIDENT OCCURRED OVER CONCRETE/BERMED AREA AND DID NOT RESULT IN ANY ACID REACHING SURFACE WATERS OR LEAVING THE PROPERTY.  AS SOON AS WAS PRACTICAL, THE EXTERNAL VALVE WAS MANUALLY SHUT.  AFTER THE VALVE WAS SECURED, THE TRUCK LEFT AND RETURNED WITH A DIFFERENT TANKER.  THE NEW TANKER WAS FILLED WITHOUT INCIDENT.  WHEN THE TANKER WAS RETURNED TO THE TERMINAL FOR INSPECTION AND REPAIR, A SMALL (3/8"") STAINLESS STEEL HOOK WAS FOUND TO BE OBSTRUCTING THE OPERATION OF THE INTERNAL VALVE.  THE METAL ROD WAS REMOVED.  THE TANKER WAS TESTED AND RETURNED TO SERVICE.","FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE STAINLESS STEEL CURVED ROD WAS BROKEN OFF FROM THE LOADING ARM AT THE TRUCK LOADOUT WHEN THE SPOUT WAS LOWERED THROUGH THE MANWAY.  THE HOOK IS USED FOR HOLDING THE LOADING ARM CAP WHILE TRUCKS ARE BEING LOADED.  A NEW SMALLER HOOK WILL BE WELDED TO THE LOADING ARM WHICH WILL MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THIS TYPE OF SITUATION IN THE FUTURE.

THE CUSTOMER HAD USED A BROKER TO BOOK THE LOAD.  THE BROKER SENT A 5000 GALLON TANKER TO PICK UP THE LOAD.  THE WAREHOUSE TECHNICIAN FILLED OUT THE INSPECTION SHEET BUT DID NOT LOOK AT THE VOLUME OF THE TANKER(IT IS NOT REQUIRED ON THE INSPECTION FORM.)  THE NORMAL TANKERS THAT ARE LOADED BY THE TECHNICIAN ARE 6800 TO 7000 GALLONS.  HE ASSUMED THIS WAS A STANDARD SIZE TANKER.  THE WAREHOUSE TECHNICIAN ATTEMPTED TO LOAD 45,000 # ONTO THE TRUCK PER THE CUSTOMER'S REQUEST.  THE DENSITY OF THE MATERIAL IS ONLY 8.16#/GAL.  THIS MEANT THAT THE TANKER WOULD ONLY HOLD APPROX. 40,000# BEFORE RUNNING OVER.  THE TECHNICIAN WAS USING THE OUTAGE ON THE TANK GUAGE TO DETERMINE THE PROPER AMOUNT LOADED, SO HE DID NOT DISCOVERED THAT THE TRAILER WOULD NOT HOLD THE MATERIAL UNTIL IT STARTED RUNNING OVER.  HE THEN HAD TO SHUT OFF THE PUMP AND CLOSE THE VALVES.  THE TRUCKS ARE LOADED ON A CONTAINED PAD SO THE SPILL DID NOT RESULT IN A RELEASE.  THE SUMP, WHICH DRAINS TO OUR ON-SITE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT, WAS CLOSED AND THE MATERIAL WAS COLLECTED INTO TOTES FOR USE IN VESSEL CLEANING LATER.  THE MATERIAL HAS A VERY LOW VAPOR PRESSURE SO NONE WAS RELEASED TO THE AIR.  WATER WAS USED TO WASH OFF THE TRUCK PAD.  THE RINSE WATER WAS DRAINED TO OUR ON-SITE WASTE WATER TREATMENT FACILITY.",WE WILL MODIFY THE PRE-LOADING CHECK LIST TO INCLUDE HAVING THE TECHNICIAN RECORD THE VOLUME OF THE TANKER.  FOR ANY TANKER LESS THAN 6800 GALLONS THE TECHNICIAN WILL HAVE TO CALCULATE THE WEIGHT IT WILL HOLD BY MULTIPLYING THE DENSITY OF THE MATERIAL BY THE VOLUME IN GALLONS OF THE TANKER.

Loading was performed by agents of SwissPort, who are under contract with the Sanford airport authority to perform loading services for TMA. The scooter was loaded wihout disconnecting the battery.  The aircraft then flew from Sanford Field, Orlando Florida to Toledo, Ohio.  When the cargo bins were opened to download the aircraft in Toledo, the scooter was noted to be on its side with battery acid spilled on both the scooter and on the cargo floor.  A ramp agent  employed by American Eagle at Toledo came in contact with the battery acid during the unloading process and suffered a minor burn to one hand for which he received first aid.  TMA Maintenance employees cleaned the cargo bin per FAA approved procedures.  No damage to the aircraft was noted.  The customer's scooter was also cleaned and returned to him.  Apparently the customer spoke to TMA agent Tiffany Schaffer in Orlando and told her that the battery was of the gel cell type.  In fact, the battery was found to be a lawn and garden battery for a lawnmower and was not a Non-Spillable type.  The Staff Vice President of Safety at TMA, along with the Vice President of Customer Service and the TMA Station Manager at Sanford were immediately notified and held a conference with senior members at Swissport the following day.

McLeod had just completed a delivery ( no oxygen, refrigerated liquid involved) to a patient in Poulsbo, WA and was enroute to his next scheduled delivery. As he was entering the on ramp from 308 onto Hwy 3 he looked in mirror and observed a liquid running out of the side door (curb side) of the cargo area. He pulled onto the shoulder, activated the vehicles emergency flashers, shut down the engine and proceeded to the cargo door. Upon opening the door he found that the piping was broken between the fill valve and the tank body. Due to the location of the break there was no way to shut off the leak.    McLeod proceeded to the bottom of the ramp so that he could divert traffic away from the vehicle and contacted his supervisor on his cell phone. He notified his supervisor of the circumstances and asked him to notify the local fire department and the WA State Patrol.    Andy Williams, Bremerton Branch Manager, immediately made the emergency notifications to local authorities as well as corporate notifications.    Upon arrivial at the scene fire department personnel inspected the vehicle. They determined that the cargo tank was no longer leaking and that the oxygen, refrigerated liquid that had leaked onto the dirt shoulder had vaporized and disapated. A short time later they stated that the scene was secure and had McLeod remove the vehicle from the scene.    Upon returning to the office the tank was inspected. It was discovered that a clamp securing the piping to a support had worked loose. Apparently, vibration had caused the piping to fracture, resulting in the release.    There were no injuries or collateral damage as a result of this incident.","As a result of this incident all drivers at the Bremerton, WA branch received retraining on the daily inspection procedures for the truck mounted cryogenic cargo tanks. McLeod received a corrective action.    The retraining is being followed up with an article addressing the inspection requirements in the next issue of the corporate Transportation Safety Newletter.    The incident was also discussed with our contracted repair and refurbishment company. It will be policy that any vessel found to have questionable supporting of the piping by the manufacture will have additional supports installed so that there will be sufficient support should a clamp be loosened in the future.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,"Apria Healthcare, Inc.",US,

BILL JONES WAS CONTACTED AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 AM BY RAY STORMS OF THE SAN JOSE FIRE DEPARTMENT WHO WAS THE INCIDENT COMMANDER ON THE SCENE.  MR. STORMS INFORMED BCS THAT MR. DOBRANSKY HAD CRASHED HIS TRACTOR TRAILER UNIT ON BAILEY ROAD AND HAD BEEN AIR LIFTED TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL.  MR. STORMS ALSO INFORMED BCS THAT A SMALL LEAK HAD OCCURRED IN THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER AND SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE WAS DRIPPING ONTO THE GROUND.  BCS ASKED MR. STORMS HOW MUCH PRODUCT WAS ON THE TRAILER AND WAS TOLD THAT APPROXIMATELY 3091 GALLONS OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE STILL REMAINED ON THE TRAILER.  THIS INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED BY MR. STORMS FROM MR. DOBRANSKY'S TANK INVENTORY SHEET.  BCS TOLD MR. STORMS THAT WE WOULD HAVE AN EMPTY TANKER TRAILER AND RESPONSE TEAM ON THE SCENE TO EMPTY MR. DOBRANKY'S TRAILER AND HELP WITH THE CLEANUP OF THE INCIDENT.  BCS IMMEDIATELY PUT TOGETHER A RESPONSE TEAM FOR THE INCIDENT.  STEVE TOCCALINO, MATT MILLER AND ED PRATT RESPONDED WITH BOTH MAINTENANCE TRUCKS WITH SPILL KITS, HOSES, PUMPS AND ANY OTHER EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO EMPTY THE LEAKING TRAILER.  TOM CARDELLI WAS IN THE RWC YARD AT THE TIME OF ANY OTHER EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO EMPTY THE LEAKING TRAILER.  TOM CARDELLI WAS IN THE RWC YARD AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO WASH OUT RUBBER LINED TRAILER 42 AND DRIVE IT TO THE SCENE.  BILL JONES, MARK SHEFFIELD, LARRY HULSE AND CHRIS SHORES ALSO RESPONDED TO THE ACCIDENT SCENE.  WHEN BILL, MARK, LARRY AND CHRIS ARRIVED AT THE SCENE, WE MET WITH MR. STORMS TO ACCESS THE ACCIDENT SCENE.  THE TRACTOR TRAILER UNIT WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET OFF OF BAILEY ROAD ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE UNIT.  MR. STORMS HAD DISPATCHED TWO TOW TRUCKS TO THE SCENE THAT HAD SECURED THE TRACTOR TRAILER TO PREVENT IT FROM SHIFTING AND ROLLING DOWN A HILL OF APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET.  THE ACCIDENT SCENE WAS SECURED BY THE SAN JOSE FIRE DEPARTMENT WHEN WE ARRIVED.  STEVE, MATT, AND ED ARRIVED AT SCENE APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES LATER AND WE MET WITH MR. STORMS TO DETERMINE AN ACTION PLAN FOR EMPTYING THE LEAKING TRAILER OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE.  SINCE THE TANKER TRAILER WAS APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS FULL, WE DETERMINED THAT THE SAFEST WAY TO TRANSFER THE PRODUCT WAS TO CUT A HOLE IN THE VAPOR SPACE OF THE TRAILER AND PLACE A STINGER INTO THE HOLE AND BEGIN TRANSFERRING PRODUCT.  AS WE CONTINUED TO EMPTY PRODUCT FROM THE LEAKING TANKER TRAILER, WE CONTINUED TO CUT HOLES IN THE VAPOR SPACE OF THE TANKER UNTIL ALL THE PRODUCT WAS REMOVED.  THE LEAKING TANKER TRAILER WAS ON A SLIGHT DOWNHILL FACING THE TRACTOR.  THE FIRST HOLE WAS CUT AT THE BACK OF THE TRAILER IN THE VAPOR SPACE AND AS PRODUCT WAS REMOVED, WE CONTINUE TO CUT HOLES TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER UNTIL ALL PRODUCT WAS REMOVED.  IT TOOK APPROXIMATELY 3 HOURS TO REMOVE ALL THE PRODUCT FROM TH","ON WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2005 WE HELD A SAFETY MEETING AT THE REDWOOD CITY BRANCH TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT WITH DAVE DOBRANSKY.

THE TRAINING INCLUDED A VIDEO AND POWERPOINT PRESENTATION.  WE TALK ABOUT SAFETY INCIDENTS AT EVERY SAFETY MEETING, WHICH ARE HELD ONCE PER MONTH.  THIS INCIDENT WILL BE DISCUSSED AT EVERY SAFETY MEETING THROUGH THE YEAR 2006.  WE WILL ALSO HAVE ROLLOVER SAFETY TRAINING AGAIN AS ONE OF THE SAFETY TOPICS IN 2006.

THE INCIDENT HAPPENED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:35PM ON THE 14TH OF SEPTEMBER AT THE PEPSI COLA PLANT LOCATED AT 4532 HIGHWAY 67 IN MESQUITE, TEXAS 75150. OUR DRIVER, MICHAEL HOOD, WAS ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A DELIVERY OF FOUR DRUMS (ECOLAB BILL OF LADMG 400-7939053) AND WAS INFORMED BY A PEPSI COLA EMPLOYEE AS HE GOT TO THEIR GUARD SHACK THAT SOMETHING WAS SPILLING FROM HIS TRUCK. THE EMPLOYEE WAS STANDING APPROXIMATELY 15 FEET FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT OF THE TRUCK. OUR DRIVER NOTICED ONE ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE APPROACHING THE TRUCK AS HE WAS GETTING OUR INVESTIGATING, AND THEN BOTH EMPLOYEES LEFT THE IMMEDIATE AREA. IT WAS LATER LEARNED THAT ONE OF THOSE MENTIONED EMPLOYEES TOLD SOMEONE THAT SHE HAD BEEN SPLASHED WITH THE CHEMICAL; HOWEVER OUR DRIVER HAS STATED TO ME THAT SHE WAS NO WHERE NEAR THE SPLASH AREA OF THE CHEMICAL, BUT MEDICAL PERSONNEL WERE CALLED IN AND I’M SURE WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT. MICHAEL HOOD OPENED THE REAR DOOR AND NOTICED THAT TWO OF THE FOUR DRUMS HAD FALLEN OFF OF THE PALLET (THE PALLET WAS SHRINK WRAPPED, BUT NOT TIED DOWN INSIDE THE TRUCK AS IS OUR REQUIREMENT. ONCE HE GOT INTO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK, THE FUMES WERE TOO SEVERE FOR HIM TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION. HE THEN EXITED THE TRUCK AND CLOSED THE DOOR AND IMMEDIATELY CALLED ME.     THEIR WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT CHEMICAL WAS LEAKING AT THAT TIME, SO I CALLED DENNIS MURRAY TO DETERMINE THE HAZARD INVOLVED WITH ALL THREE ITEM CODES ON THE PALLET. DENNIS FAXED ME MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETS (MSDS) ON ALL CODE NUMBERS AND I FAXED THE SAME TO PEPSI COLA. THE ITEM CODES ARE TWO (2) 54 GAL. DRUMS OF AC-30 CODE #47449, ONE (1) 50 GAL. DRUM OF BEVRO-SHEEN CODE #43943, AND ONE (1) 50 GAL. DRUM OF VORTEXX CODE # 43841. IT WAS NOW APPROXIMATELY 1:30PM AND I WAS INFORMED THAT THE ENTRANCE TO THE PLANT HAD BEEN CLOSED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THAT NO DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT WAS LEAKING HAD OCCURRED. I CALLED AND TALKED WITH STAN HATFIELD AND THE SAFETY MANAGER AT THE ECOLAB PLANT TO ASCERTAIN THE CLEAN-UP PROCEDURES FOR EACH CODE NUMBER LISTED SINCE WE STILL DID NOT KNOW. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD QUARANTINED THE TRUCK AND SURROUNDING AREA BY THIS TIME AND WAS NOT ALLOWING ANYONE TO COME NEAR THE VEHICLE. THE DALLAS HAZMAT RESPONSE TEAM WAS THEN SUITING UP WITH HAZMAT SUITS AND SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS (SCBA) TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS LEAKING. THEY HAD ALSO SHUT DOWN THE SOUTHBOUND ENTRANCE TO BIG TOWN BOULEVARD AND BIG TOWN BOULEVARD ALSO. I WAS INFORMED BY STAN HATFIELD AND THE SAFETY MANAGER THAT IF THERE WAS NOT A REALLY STRONG VINEGAR ODOR, WE COULD BE SURE THAT THE VORTEXX WAS NOT LEAKING, AND THAT THE CLEAN-UP CONSISTED OF ABSORBENTS.
