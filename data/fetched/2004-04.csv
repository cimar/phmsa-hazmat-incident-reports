THE RAIL CAR WAS LOCATED ON THE TERMINAL SCALES AT THE LOADING RACK.  DURING LOADING OPERATIONS, THE TERMINAL MANAGER HEARD A POPPING OR RATTLING NOISE THAT SOUNDED LIKE A PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE OPENING ON THE RAIL CAR.  THE PUMPS WERE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW OF PRODUCT TO THE RAIL CAR. FROM ATOP THE RAILCAR, THE TERMINAL MANAGER COULD HEAR A VAPOR RELEASE SOUND COMING FROM BETWEEN THE TANK AND SHELL OF THE RAIL CAR.  HE DISCOVERED A SMALL AMOUNT OF AMMONIA VAPOR ESCAPING FROM THE END OF THE RAIL CAR.  HE DISCOVERED A SMALL AMOUNT OF AMMONIA VAPOR ESCAPING FROM THE END OF THE RAIL CAR.  THREE (3) OPERATORS BEGAN SPRAYING WATER ONTO THE RAILCAR ANYWHERE GAS COULD POSSIBLY LEAK OUT BETWEEN THE TANK AND THE SHELL.  FIRE HOSES WERE UTILIZED TO SPRAY WATER TOWARD THE AMMONIA VAPORS THAT WERE ESCAPING.  WATER SPRAY WAS CONTINUOUSLY APPLIED FROM SHORTLY AFTER DISCOVERY ON 4/23/04 UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 3:00 PM ON APRIL 25, 2004. AFTER WATER OPERATIONS CONCLUDED, RESPONDERS CONTINUED TO SMELL TRACE AMMONIA VAPOR DUE TO VAPOR THAT REMAINED IN THE INSULATION BETWEEN THE CAR AND SHELL.  THE RELEASE WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE TERMINAL PROPERTY.  THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE RESULTED IN AN UNDETERMINED QUANTITY OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA (AMMONIA VAPOR).  NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE ILLINOIS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (IEMA) AND THE MORGAN COUNTY LEPC ON APRIL 23, 2004. FOLLOW-UP NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO IEMA AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER ON APRIL 26, 2004.  ALL OF THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WAS OFFLOADED BY 4:00 PM ON APRIL 25, 2004.  THE RAIL CAR WAS RETAINED ON TERMINAL PROPERTY.  ON APRIL 27, 2004 THE ILLINOIS DEPT. OF AGRICULTURE INSPECTED AND RED TAGGED THE RAIL CAR.  ON JUNE 8, 2004 A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE U.S. DEPT.

I ARRIVED TO THE INSPECTION AREA AT 0745.  I WENT THROUGH THE INSPECTION AREA & ARRIVED AT THE GUARDHOUSE AT 0810 & THEN THE SCALES AT 0820.  I WAITED AT THE SCALES UNTIL APP. 0930 AND WAS THEN TOLD TO GO TO THE UNLOADING AREA.  I WAS MET AT THE UNLOADING BY TWO BASF EMPLOYEES (KEITH PRINCE & JEREMY VOGEL).  I GAVE ONE OF THEM MY PAPERWORK & HE WENT TO GET APPROVAL TO OFFLOAD.  AT THAT TIME, I HOOKED UP THE PTO SHAFT & THEN PUT ON MY PPE.  I WENT TO THE BACK OF THE TRAILER & REMOVE THE LOCK FROM THE DOORS.  I NOTICED THAT THE BLEED OFF VALVE ON THE VAPOR LINE WAS HALF OPEN & BOTH SCREWS GOING INTO THE BLEED OFF VALVES WERE OFF.  I THEN HOOKED UP THE VAPOR HOSE & SECURED THE BLEED OFF VALVE.  I THEN OPENED THE HANDLE TO RELEASE THE PRESSURE ON THE LIQUID LINE & HOOKED UP THE HOSE & THEN SECURED THE BLEED OFF VALVE.  I THEN ASKED THE OPERATOR WHAT HIS TANK PRESSURE WAS & HE SAID ABOUT 80 POUNDS.  I LOOKED AT MY PRESSURE GAUGE AND IT READ 40 LBS.  THE OPERATOR THEN OPENED HIS VAPOR VALUES AND I OPEN THE VALVES GOING TO THE COMPRESSOR ON BOTH LINES.  I THEN OPEN BOTH INTERNAL & EXTERNAL VAPOR VALVES TO EQUALIZE THE PRESSURE ON THE CUSTOMERS TANK & MY TRAILER.  AFTER EQUALIZING THE TANK & TRAILER, THE CUSTOMERS TANK READ APP 70 LBS & MY PRESSURE GAUGE READ APP 60 LBS.  THE CUSTOMER THEN OPENED UP HIS LIQUID VALVES TO HIS STORAGE TANK WHICH IS IN THEIR STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE.  I THEN ATTEMPTED TO OPEN UP MY EXTERNAL & INTERNAL VALVES TO GET FLOW.  I THEN TURN ON THE COMPRESSOR.  AT THAT TIME I CLOSED MY INTERNAL LIQUID VALVE TO INCREASE PRESSURE ON MY TRAILER.  AT THAT POINT, THE PRESSURE GAUGE READING SLOWLY STARTED RISING. THE OPERATOR & I DISCUSS TEN WHEN SHOULD WE OPEN MY VALVE & I BELIEVE I SAID ABOUT 80 POUNDS.  THAT WOULD GIVE US ABOUT 10 POUNDS DIFFERENCE.  WHEN THE PRESSURE GAUGE READ BETWEEN 80 AND 85 POUNDS, I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF OPENING UP THE INTERNAL VALVE WHEN THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE WENT OFF.  THE OPERATORS IMMEDIATELY SECURED THEIR VALVES & I SECURED MY VALVES & THEN RAN TO THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK TO SECURE THE PTO SHAFT.  THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE WAS OPEN FOR ABOUT 15-30 SECONDS.  THE OPERATORS THEN CALLED THEIR FOREMAN & BASF AT THAT TIME WENT INTO A EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT MODE.  BETWEEN 5 TO 8 PERSONNEL SHOWED UP AT THE UNLOADING RACK AND THE OPERATORS & I INFORM THEM WHAT HAD HAPPEN.  I EXPLAINED THE PSI SETTING ON THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE, WHERE IT WAS LOCATED & THE READING ON THE PRESSURE GAUGE.  I THEN CALLED THE PENSACOLA TERMINAL & INFORM ERIC SCHAFFER WHAT HAS HAPPEN & TO GET VERIFICATION ON THE SETTING OF THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE.  AT THAT TIME, THE FOREMAN MOTIONED ME BACK TO THE TRUCK & TOLD ME SOMEBODY TAPPED THE PRESSURE GAUGE & THE NEEDLE WENT UP TO 125.  AFTER DISCUSSING WHAT WE SHOULD DO.

ARNDT, EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE TRACTOR-TRAILER, AND A SIGNIFICANT SPILL OF THE EMULSION THAT WAS IN THE TRAILER.  AN OFFICER OF THE WYOMING HIGHWAY PATROL, LOCAL FIRE AND RESCUE PERSONNEL, AND AN AMBULANCE FROM ROCK SPRINGS WYOMING RESPONDED TO THE ACCIDENT.  UPON ARRIVING AT BLACK BUTTE COAL COMPANY EARLY IN THE MORNING ON APRIL 18, 2004, GARY ARNDT WAS INFORMED THAT THE EMULSION STORAGE TANK IN THE PIT 8 AREA WAS EMPTY.  EMULSION WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PROCEED WITH THE LOADING OF BLAST HOLES THAT WAS PLANNED FOR THE DAY SO MR. ARNDT DROVE HIS COMPANY VEHICLE TO THE MSI FACILITY AT POINT OF ROCKS, WYOMING.  AT THE PLANT MR. ARNDT FOUND A SEMI-TRACTOR (T-002) AND TRAILER (0012), LOADED WITH EMULSION AND PARKED ON THE TRUCK SCALE.  MR. ARNDT THEN STARTED THE RIG AND PROCEEDED TOWARD BLACK BUTTE COAL COMPANY WITH THE INTENTION OF PUMPING THE CONTENTS OF THE TRAILER INTO THE STORAGE SILO AT THE PIT 8 AREA, RETURNING THE TRACTOR-TRAILER TO THE PLANT, AND THEN GOING BACK TO THE MINE TO BEGIN LOADING OPERATIONS.  TRAVELING ROUGHLY EASTWARD ON THE BLACK BUTTE ROAD AT APPROXIMATELY 0800, MR. ARNDT ROUNDED A FAIRLY SHARP 90-DEGREE CURVE TO THE RIGHT, PASSED UNDER INTERSTATE 80, AND BEGAN TO NEGOTIATE A SECOND, SIMILARLY SHARP, CURVE TO THE RIGHT.  AT A POINT VERY CLOSE TO THE APEX OF THE CURVE, THE SEMI-TRAILER ROLLED ONTO ITS LEFT SIDE AND PULLED TRACTOR ONTO ITS LEFT SIDE AS WELL (THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER REMAINED COUPLED UNTIL THEY WERE STOOD UPRIGHT BY A TOW TRUCK AND UNCOUPLED BY THE WRECKER CREW). THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER SLID ACROSS THE OPPOSITE LANE (APPROXIMATELY 25-30 FEET), AND CAME TO REST WITH THE TRAILER IN A SHALLOW DITCH AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH EMULSION SPILLING ONTO THE GROUND FROM THE ACCESS COVERS ON TOP OF THE TRAILER.  THE TRACTOR WAS ALSO ON ITS SIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ONCOMING LANE OF TRAFFIC.  MR. ARNDT WAS ABLE TO EXIT THE TRACTOR BY CLIMBING OUT THROUGH THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR (WHICH WAS, BY THEN, ON THE TOP OF THE TRACTOR).  HE THEN USED HIS CELL PHONE TO CALL FOR ASSISTANCE AND BEGIN MAKING NITIFICATIONS OF THE ACCIDENT.  LARRY LIPSEY, MSI TECHNICAL SERVICES REPRESENTATIVE AND MR.

KEVIN WAS TO UNLOAD AT NEW TANK SITE ABOVE; HE CHECKED FITTINGS AND PLUGS IN EACH END OF TANK BEFORE STARTING HIS UNLOADING OF PRODUCT.  WHEN HE STARTED PUMPING OFF HE NOTICED GASOLINE ESCAPING FROM UNDERNEATH THE TANK.  HE IMMEDIATELY REVERSED HIS PUMP AND CHECKED THE SITE.  HE CALLED BILLY PUCKETT AND MR. DENNIS WALTRIP SITE MANAGER FOR ALABAMA POWER.  BILLY PUCKETT IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED JODY HIGHTOWER OF TPE AND BOB RUTLEDGE.  JODY IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED BILLY TOLBERT AND SAM HOVIES TO THE SITE FOR IMMEDIATE EVALUATION.  ONCE BILLY, JODY, AND BOB HAD TIME TO GET TOGETHER, BOB RUTLEDGE NOTIFIED ADEM IN MONTGOMERY AND CALLED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE LINE. RODNEY PRICE, MOP SALES REPRESENTATIVE WAS NOTIFIED.  BILLY TOLBERT ESTIMATED APPROXIMATELY 100 GALLONS OF GASOLINE HAD BEEN DISCHARGED THROUGH A DRAIN PLUG INSTALLED BY MANUFACTURER IN THE BOTTOM OF THE NEW TANK.  THE GASOLINE WAS CONTAINED AROUND TANK AND THERE WAS NO DANGER OF RUN OFF TO STREAM OR WATER SOURCES.  THIS TANK WAS RECENTLY PURCHASED FROM A NEW TANK SUPPLIER AND THE TANKS WE HAD BEEN PURCHASING ONLY HAD DRAIN PLUGS FROM A NEW TANK SUPPLIER AND THE TANKS WE HAD BEEN PURCHASING ONLY HAD DRAIN PLUGS IN THE ENDS.  THEREFORE, OUR TECHNICIANS DID NOT KNOW TO CHECK FOR A DRAIN IN BOTTOM MIDDLE OF THE NEW TANKS.  KEVIN DUNN COULD NOT HAVE SEEN THIS FROM HIS INSPECTION.  JODY AND BOB FELT THE BEST ACTION WAS TO REMOVE AGGREGATE AROUND TANK AREA AND CARRY IT TO OUR SITE IN TRUSSVILLE AND PLACE IT ON PLASTIC AND TREAT IT WITH GATOR ABSORBENT.  JODY DISPATCHED LOCAL CONTRACTOR WITH BACKHOE AND DUMP TRUCK TO THE SITE.  BOB WAS CALLED BY, MR. DARREN HOLLIMAN OUT OF BIRMINGHAM ADEM OFFICE, WHOM WAS THE DESIGNATED ADEM RESPONDER.

BOB RUTLEDGED CALLED, MR DENNIS WALTRIP WITH ALABAMA POWER TO ADVISE HIM OF INCIDENT STATUS AND STEPS WE WERE TAKING.  HE SEEMED TO BE FINE WITH OUR RESPONSE.  CONTRACTOR REMOVED AGGREGATE AND SOIL AROUND TANK AND SPREAD FRESH AGGREGATE AROUND CUSTOMER TANK.  IN THE MEANTIME, BILLY TOLBERT HAD INSTALLED PLUG IN TANK. JODY HIGHTOWER INSPECTED ALL OF THE NEW TANKS WE HAD RECENTLY RECEIVED AND FOUND THEY ALL HAD DRAINS IN THE SAME PLACE.  WHEN THE MATERIAL FROM SITE WAS DELIVERED TO TRUSSVILLE YARD, JODY HIGHTOWER INSPECTED AND SUPERVISED UNLOADING.
