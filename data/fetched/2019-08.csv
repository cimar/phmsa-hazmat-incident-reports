The origin of the leak was two 5 gallon totes of Chem Aqua (Hazardous) at the rear of the trailer. These 2 tote were cracked when a pallet of forklift forks fell from the second layer.

Workers from TXDOT noticed that the tank was leaking product, so they proceeded to follow and flag down our unit.  The cargo tank came to a stop on the access or frontage road to access South Loop 250, Midland TX 79703.  Midland PD, Midland FD and TCEQ were notified and responded to the scene.  TCEQ confirmed the leakage was minimal and that soda ash could be used to neutralize whatever acid was spilled on the roadway.  The cargo tank was leaking from the front manhole cover assembly, technicians discovered that the manhole assembly was faulty and as a result the cause of the leak.  The cargo tank was then equalized with the rear compartment, since the rear compartment was empty.  This allowed the product level to go down enough to prevent leakage.  The cargo tank was then driven and escorted back to the loading yard for unloading and repairs.  From the time of stop to the time the situation was resolved, there was about an hour duration where the road had to be closed to the motoring public.","We will implement additional safety measure practices in order to prevent future leakages.  Drivers will be trained to stop before leaving a loading facility and do a walk around check of valves, closures, manholes, pressure relief devices to ensure no product is leaking.

A Veolia employee removed the 30 gallon fiber drum from the truck and placed it on the warehouse floor while they were finalizing the shipment count.  When the Veolia employee went back to the 30 gallon fiber drum they noticed that the bottom of the container was saturated from a  broken inner container that leaked.  The estimated amount of spilled material inside the 30 gallon fiber drum was estimated to be about 1 gallon.  There was absorbent (vermiculite) inside of the drum so the leak did not go beyond the outside of the 30 gallon fiber drum.  The 30 gallon fiber drum was  overpacked and shipped to its final destination.  It was determined that the 30 gallon fiber drum might not have had enough absorbent material to cushion the inner containers which resulted in an inner container breaking.",To help mitigate this from occurring again Veolia EHS Managers discussed the spill incident with the  Veolia field technicians during the weekly safety training on 8/21/19.  The training included steps to ensure that all packages contain an adequate amount of absorbent material to cushion the inner  containers.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

I came out to inspect the car and had found that Asphalt was leaking form the manway lid that was partially open about a half and inch.  All the swing bolts were in place and tight. I removed the old seal which I was not able to read the number of since it was covered in Asphalt.  I investigated before I opened the lid and found that the reason the lid did not close all the way was because the lid was stuck on the safety collars of the swing bolts not allowing the lid to close all the way.  I opened the lid all the way to check the lid gasket and found that it should be replaced.  I replaced the gasket with a new one.  I then adjusted the safety collars on the bolts and closed the lid and tightened the bolts.

I loosened the cap to see how much product would come out and after the initial gush of fluid, the leak drained down to a drip.  I took the cap the rest of the way off and looked up inside the valve and noticed that the seal around the ball was leaking through.  I put the cap back on and tightened it with a 36” pipe wrench.  The leak stopped.  I had the car set to the car shop tracks to eventually be transloaded.  This car was tranloaded by Enviroserve on 8/15/2019 and home shop stickers were applied.

THE SHIPMENT WAS TENDERED FOR GROUND SERVICE BY FERGUSON #2623 LOCATED AT 5722 49TH STREET, MASPETH, NJ 11378. THE CONSIGNEE WAS LISTED AS BLACKMAN PLUMBING SUPPLY (A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF FERGUSON) 900 SYLVAN AVENUE, BAYPORT, NY 11705. THE SHIPMENT SUBSEQUENTLY LEAKED DURING TRANSPORTATION AND AN ASSOCIATE WAS EXPOSED DURING RECEIVING. AFTER INVESTIGATION BY FERGUSON IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SHIPMENT CONTAINED SIX 1 QUART POLYETHYLENE CONTAINERS OF OATEY-HERCULES CLOBBER, IDENTIFIED AS UN1830, SULFURIC ACID, 8, PGII, LIMITED QUANTITY. THE BOTTLES OF ACID WERE NOT PLACED IN STRONG OUTER PACKAGING - THE BOX WAS A REUSED BOX THAT PREVIOUSLY HELD PIPE FITTINGS. THE PACKAGE WAS NOT ORIENTATED CORRECTLY DURING SHIPMENT (BECAUSE IT DID NOT HAVE ORIENTATION ARROWS) WHICH CAUSED ONE OF THE BOTTLES OF SULFURIC ACID TO LEAK AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE ACID DEGRADED THE FIBERBOARD BOX. WHEN THE RECEIVING ASSOCIATE PICKED UP THE BOX HE COULD NOT SEE IT WAS DEGRADED ON THE BOTTOM AND THE BOX FAILED RELEASING LIQUID ACID ON TO HIS CLOTHING AND SKIN. THE ASSOCIATE WAS ALSO UNAWARE THE BOX CONTAINED A LIMITED QUANTITY HAZARDOUS MATERIAL BECAUSE THE BOX WAS NOT MARKED. MANAGEMENT IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED AND WASHED OFF THE ACID, REMOVED IMPACTED CLOTHING AND CALLED THE INTERNAL NURSE LINE SERVICE. THE ASSOCIATE DID NOT REQUIRE FURTHER TREATMENT AND WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK THE NEXT DAY. THE RELEASED SULFURIC ACID WAS CLEANED UP WITH THE SPILL KIT AND DISPOSED OF BY OUR HAZARDOUS WASTE VENDOR, CLEAN HARBORS.","AFTER RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF THIS INCIDENT BY THE RECEIVING ASSOCIATES AT BLACKMAN, FERGUSON INVESTIGATED THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THIS SHIPMENT. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THAT ASSOCIATE WHO PACKAGED THE ORDER FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE PRODUCT REQUIRED SPECIFIC PACKAGING AS WELL AS SPECIFIC LABELING, AND HANDLING MARKINGS. THE ASSOCIATE HAS BEEN SUSPENDED FROM PACKAGING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FOR SHIPMENT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE AND WILL BE REQUIRED TO UNDERGO EXTENSIVE RE-TRAINING PRIOR TO BEING ALLOWED TO PACKAGE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FOR SHIPMENT. ADDITIONALLY, FERGUSON HAS MODIFIED THE INTERNAL SYSTEM MESSAGE THAT IDENTIFIES HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ON THESE SHIPMENTS TO HELP ENSURE THAT ASSOCIATES RECOGNIZE THESE ITEMS ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS.

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS PUTTING OUT ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND BOOMS TO TRY AND CONTAIN THE FUEL TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY.

Sulphur, LA. Management was notified immediately upon discovery and responded to the on-property location of the spill. It was discovered that the Dewatering Vacuum box that had been transported had a front side wall failure next to the cable hook on the box. This box had been inspected by the driver before departing the offeror facility and no failure could be detected at the time. The truck route was retraced from 7170 John Brannon Rd to the offeror facility and it was found that leaked material had come in contact with the roadway in between the two locations. A preliminary investigation determined that the type of material offered, was not the material listed on the manifest. This material degraded the front side wall of the box, which during transport, caused the wall near the cable hook to fail. The emergency response plan was enacted, and the emergency response coordinator made emergency notifications. The emergency response contractors were contacted and began cleanup of the affected areas.

However, the driver was not able to be present during the actual loading of the hazardous material, therefore the driver was unable to confirm the load securement to prevent forward movement and movement of the hazardous material from left to right. During this incident, the load appeared to shift forward, which was also due to improper securement from the shipper pertaining to the pallets used not being in sufficient condition for the hazardous material being transported, and improper load securement to prevent forward and left to right shifting.","Corrective Actions: All drivers operating for Speed Freight, Inc. will have hazardous materials training conducted with CellEx Consulting Group. The training will include: - Identifying hazardous materials - Verifying proper securement of all freight including hazardous materials - Verifying that the hazardous materials are properly listed on bills of lading including emergency response information - Bills of lading with hazardous materials are in the proper locations during transport - Placarding and labeling requirements for hazardous materials - Defensive driving and extreme weather training - All drivers are trained on what to do in the event of a hazardous material incident. - All existing and new office personnel will be trained in hazardous materials and the proper procedures that are required to be followed when a hazardous material incident occurs to prevent reporting violations Upon completion of the hazardous materials training, each driver will be required to pass a written test with a score of 80% or higher.

Explanation of Violation:  During the transportation of the hazardous material, the driver was able to confirm the load securement on the rear portion of the trailer only, which the driver did confirm to the best of his ability per the federal regulatory requirements.  However, the driver was not able to be present during the actual loading of the hazardous material, therefore the driver was unable to confirm the load securement to prevent forward movement and movement of the hazardous material from left to right.   During this incident, the load appeared to shift forward, which was also due to improper securement from the shipper pertaining to the pallets used not being in sufficient condition for the hazardous material being transported, and improper load securement to prevent forward and left to right shifting.  Per 49 CFR § 177.834(a) – Packages secured in a motor vehicle.  Any package containing any hazardous material, not permanently attached to a motor vehicle, must be secured against shifting, including relative motion between packages, within the vehicle on which it is being transported, under conditions normally incident to transportation.  Packages having valves or other fittings must be loaded in a manner to minimize the likelihood of damage during transportation.  In the case of the transportation of this hazardous material, the driver/carrier confirmed the load securement of the hazardous material for the rear portion of the hazardous material prior to the seal being placed on the trailer.  However, confirming all aspects of load securement from shifting forward or left to right was not possible for the driver/carrier prior to the seal being placed on the trailer, due to the driver not being able to be present during the loading process.  In this case it was necessary for the driver/carrier to rely on the shipper for proper load securement in the areas where the driver/carrier were not able to confirm load securement per 49 CFR § 392.9.  49 CFR § 171.16 – Failure to file a written hazardous material incident report within 30 days of discovering a hazardous material incident reportable under section 171.15(b) or 171.16(a).  Explanation of Violation:  Based on the violations for the forward and left to right securement of the hazardous material and the improper palletization of the hazardous material, which was the responsibility of the shipper at the time of loading, and listed in the “Explanation of Violations” for 171.15, it is still the responsibility of the carrier to confirm that proper load securement is adhering to the proper regulatory requirements.  It is also the responsibility of the carrier to inform PHMSA of the hazardous materials incident within thirty days of the incident occurring.","Corrective Actions:  Speed Freight, Inc. has corrected the violation for 171.16 by submitting the required notice to PHMSA, as should have been done within thirty days of the hazardous material incident. In addition to the training already received by all drivers and office personnel, the entire staff for Speed Freight, Inc. will be retrained in hazardous materials which will be conducted with CellEx Consulting Group.  The training will include:  - Identifying hazardous materials - Verifying proper securement of all freight including hazardous materials - Verifying that the hazardous materials are properly listed on bills of lading including emergency response information - Bills of lading with hazardous materials are in the proper locations during transport - Placarding and labeling requirements for hazardous materials - Defensive driving and extreme weather training  - All drivers are trained on what to do in the event of a hazardous material incident.   - All existing and new office personnel will be trained in hazardous materials and the proper procedures that are required to be followed when a hazardous material incident occurs to prevent reporting violations  Upon completion of the hazardous materials training, each driver will be required to pass a written test with a score of 80% or higher.  Each driver will also receive a certificate showing that the driver has completed the hazardous materials training required by the company.
