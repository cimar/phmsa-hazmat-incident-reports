The driver stopped and discovered he had product (propionic acid) leaking from the bottom center of the trailer.  The driver proceeded to a nearby parking area off the roadway which he thought would be a safer location to deal with the issue.  He immediately notified Johnsrud Transport of the problem.  At the same time law enforcement officials arrived on scene and notified the local fire department and Oklahoma Highway Patrol.  Sooner Emergency Services, an Oklahoma licensed hazmat response company, was notified and dispatched to the scene.  They diked the area around the trailer to contain the spill and placed containers under the trailer to catch the leaking product while waiting for another trailer to transfer the load to.  Approximately 210 gallons of product was captured in barrels which would leave about 80 gallons that were spilled on the ground.  Sooner Emergency Services cleaned and restored the area to the satisfaction of the Oklahoma Office of Emergency Management which reported the incident to the Oklahoma Dept of Environmental Quality (Incident #74772).  A subsequent internal inspection of the trailer by Stuart Tank, Elkhorn, WI indicated a 5"" crack on the curbside of the sump area.",,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,20527,Johnsrud Transport Inc,US,

John Vergis, Environmental Officer, was called and when he arrived confirmed the leak and called 911.  When the county HazMat team arrived they set up air monitoring. John Vergis went in with two HazMat team members to investigate the leak.  It was found that liquid was drippig from the housing and ice had formed on the bottom of the housing.  When the housing was opened, ice had consumed the liquid valve on the ""B"" end of the car.  John Vergis discovered that the valve was not fully tightened and when he cleared the ice away he also found that the plug on the valve was also loose.  The valve was tightened and leak stopped and then the plug was tightened and car was then secure with no further action necessary.",Better loading procedures need to be adopted.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

The driver, making a routine inspection of the  vehicle during that time, noticed a small leak coming from the vent line of the tanker.  A response crew was summoned who donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and cleaned up the leaked material. The clean up material  was placed into a suitable salvage container and taken back into the plant for later shipment.  The cause of the leak was a frozen vent line that did not properly seal. The line was thawed out, re-sealed properly, and the load continued to the intended  waste disposal facility without further incident.    The incident was reported to the State of Minnesota who assigned incident number 116521",Both the driver and the shipper's personnel who were involved with loading the tanker were cautioned to insure that all vent lines are properly closed during sub freezing temperatures,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, HCH Marketing, was contacted via CHEMTREC, Report 2011-01-06-00072. HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the cause of the release was due to the bottom outlet valve operating handle pinned and secured with a seal in the open position and the bottom outlet cap less than tool tight. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative, Sue Schwartz at 281-331-7766 ext. 104. HEPACO personnel placed the bottom outlet valve operating handle in the closed position and tightened the secondary securement cap with a wrench.

An initial investigation of the accident was completed and it was determined that there was no release of any free product.  Due to slippery road conditions on Interstate 30, a large stretch of the Interstate was shut down by local authorities.  On January 11, 2010, the Bayer Material Science emergency response unit began the product transfer.  The product was loaded into a new tanker provided by Slay Transportation Co., Inc.  The Bayer Material Science emergency response unit confirmed that there was no release of any product from the overturned tanker.","Since the release was accidental, and may have been related to slippery road conditions, no actions have been taken to prevent recurrence.

The Louisiana State Police, Steve Childers, was on site for response and identified this car. These release was not liquid material, but was vapor-odor emitting from defective closure. Leak found to originate from a loose four bolt flange below the liquid line valve connecting to the dip tube. The four bolts were found finger tight. The responders tightened this flanged fitting tool tight correcting the release. Appears when Exxonmobil unloaded this car, they connected to the four bolt flange located below the valve and failed to tighted it when finished.  Chemtrec was notified by KCS CID, who in turn notifed Exxonmobil. No Chemtrec call back was received from shipper Exxonmobil responding to this incident.  Mr. Mike Accettella, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, 318-308-1770, called requesting a verbal report which was provided.     KCS emergency mitigation services were activated to provide for special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, dedicated internal management oversight, train/yard crew delay, and regulatory reporting as appropriate.  KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 may apply as services require.    Report Notes:  Item 13; No consignee information was provided on the waybill. The UP Railroad is shown on waybill to delivery switch car to consignee at Bayport, TX. The consignee information is unknown by KCS. Exxonmobil or UP can provide this data.     Item 19: No liquid product was released by this car. Only product odor vapors were release. PHMSA DOT reporting system defects will not allow reporting release in units other than what is used for reporting capcity. Therefore this vapor odor release was reported as 0.1 gallon to make the PHMSA DOT system accept report.     Item 27, amount in package, was estimated by preparer. This action was to facilitate data acceptance by defective PHMSA DOT IT system edits. Specifically, this estimated quantity was required for two reasons:   (1)because the shipper only provided bulk quantity on shipping paper, as 1 Tank Car, per PHMSA DOT requirements; and   (2)because the PHMSA DOT e-system requires data in this field which use the same units of measure as found in the capacity field.   KCS will continue to report in this fashion unit instructed differently by DOT or PHMSA.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

Responder found two emissions from this car. One at the liquid line valve where valve thread connection is made to tank car. And a second at the threaded connection of the vacuum relief valve where valve threads to manway cover. Responder tightened the liquid valve  turn correcting the small leak. However, the responder tried to tighten the vacuum relief valve connection but couldnt tighten enough to correct leak. The tank car does have a nitrogen pad.  The shipper Exxonmobil was notified via Chemtrec and responded to the site replacing the vacuum vent valve. The new valve threads were prepared with teflon tape sealant when reapply correcting the release point.  A 4 PSI Nitrogen pad was re-applied to this car and a field leak test was completed and passed. This car now requires a formal leak test by a qualified provider or a FRA One Time Movement Approval before it can proceed in transportation.  Shipper Exxonmobil is working on securing either movement approval or leak test for this car. Louisiana state police was notified at 2:45pm, report number 11-00272. Chemtrec re-notify at 3:05pm, under same report number.     KCS emergency mitigation services were activated to provide for special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, dedicated internal management oversight, train/yard crew delay, and regulatory reporting as appropriate.  KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 may apply as services require.    Report Notes:  Item 27, amount in package, was estimated by preparer. This action was to facilitate data acceptance by defective PHMSA DOT IT system edits. Specifically, this estimated quantity was required for two reasons:   (1)because the shipper only provided bulk quantity on shipping paper, as 1 Tank Car, per PHMSA DOT requirements; and   (2)because the PHMSA DOT e-system requires data in this field which use the same units of measure as found in the capacity field. KCS will continue to report in this fashion unit instructed differently by DOT or PHMSA.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

They immediately notified the Yardmaster on duty and left the area until the car could be inspected.  Shipper (Southern Chemical/ITC) were notified of the incidnet and they sent a response team to the scene. Ruben Romero from Union Tank Car and Cory Guccione from ITC arrived on scene at 1220 PM along with PTRA Director of Safety and Environmental.  It was determined that the bottom outlet handle was loose and the valve itself was defective allowing product to bypass the valve and collect in the cap.  There were two gaskets inside the cap and product was able to bypass the gaskets and leak around the cap threads. Absorbent pads were inserted into the pipe below the valve, a new gasket was installed and the cap was replaced.

The FD responders reported that the bottom outlet valve's operating handle was in the open position and not secured or pinned which allowed product to leak out at the bottom outlet's closure cap (BOC) which was hand tight. The FD closed the BOV which ended any further product release by 1240 hrs. CST, 1/05/2011. Afterwards, BNSF contract responders arrived and checked securement of UTLX 209040. These responders tool tightened the BOC on UTLX 209040 and inspected the remainder of the train's entrained railcars for securement issues. The responders reported finding four other tank cars in the train with the BOV's in the closed position, but the BOC's were less than tool tight.

PTRA Trainmaster Young responded to the scene and contacted M&M Protection at INEOS' request to respond the the leak. M&M arrived on scene and determined that product was leaking from the connection between the 3"" to 2"" reducer and the valve/nipple assembly on the liquied line. They were able to tighten the valve assembly and nipple by approximately a three quarter turn stopping the leak. There was teflon tape on the threads however it appears it came off of the threads as the nipple/valve assembly was tightened onto the reducer allowing product to leak around the threads. Total product leaked was approximately one gallon with some product on the cross ties beneath the car.  M&M cleaned up all product on the ground and washed down the car and ground with a water/microbug solution. The car was secured and the scene was cleared at 0115 hrs on January 28.",INEOS has launched an internal ivestigation into the cause of the leak. It has been reported that this is the second load the car has had since it was requalified in 2009.

He stated that he had been moving it to the rear of our delivery trailer with a powered pallet jack and the throttle stuck.  He used the kill switch as the front of the pallet jack was off the rear of the trailer and the IBC had fallen off the back of the trailer.  When it hit the ground, it ruptured the bottom of the IBC leaking 2/3 of its contents.  The forklift operator of our customer lifted the IBC and placed it into a containment area, which collected in their wastewater system.  We then called IMS Environmental Services and notified them of the incident and requested a response team to assist.  While enroute to the incident, at approximately 1020, I called the NRC.  IMS arrived onscene and began pumping the material into another IBC.  Once all of the material was pumped, we began neutralizing the area and then powered washed it into a sump collection on the customer's site which would be processed in their wastewater system.",Industrial Chemicals is investigating the cause of the throttle sticking and also implementing a safety barrier as the driver brings items to the rear of trailers.,Yes,IBC,"Plastic, freestanding, for liquids",31H2,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,5373,"Industrial Chemicals, Inc.",US,

It is assumed that the ring failed when the drum bumped against another drum druing transport. The container was checked and resealed and checked again for a properly fitting closure ring and cover. The container was then shipped to the disposal facility originally destined. The material that leaked was cleaned up and sent to a proper waste disposal facility.

The transfer was immediatley stopped by the driver by shutting off the air supply to the tanker. Less than five gallons of dilute ammonium hydroxide was released into a concrete containment unloading area. An emergency response contractor was engaged to clean up the release.,"The chemical transfer hose utilzed for the transfer is a Fabcem hose manufactured by Goodyear which is compatible for use with ammonium hydroxide solution.  Chemical transfer hoses are pressure tested and visually inspected annually. The hoses are also inspected monthly , and daily prior to use. Preventative maintenance inspection and testing records of the hose were reviewed. The subject hose was pressure tested and visually inspected in June , 2010. The unloading hose was examined for signs of wear and tear. There were no obvious abrasions, cuts or evidence of wear and tear on the exterior of the hose.     The facility is evaluating the inspection frequency and service life for chemical transfer hoses.

Sooner Emergency Response Services, Inc. was contacted to perform remediation cleanup services.    Tractor/trailer had jackknifed after colliding with another vehicle while traveling north bound on a snow and ice packed roadway. The tractor/trailer slid into the center median and was leaking fuel. Sooner Emergency Service was requested to conduct an emergency response to the site and perform remediation cleanup services as required. Appropriate technicians and equipment were immediately dispatched to the site to perform the operations.    Technicians arriving on site found a Dynamex Operations East, Inc tractor/trailer  had slid into the center median and struck the DOT cable barrier. The barrier  performed as expected and prevented the tractor/trailer from entering the south  bound lane. The left fuel tank was ruptured by the jack down dolly on the trailer  and the center median barrier cable ruptured the right fuel tank.    A traffic directional arrow board and reflective traffic cones were set in place to  designate the area a work zone and aleli the motoring public of the situation as  they approached the site. The tractor/trailer was against the cable barrier and had  stretched the cable to a point that the truck could not be moved.    As the tractor/trailer set in the median against the cable barrier, fuel continued to slowly leak from the left fuel tank. This leaking could not be stopped until the  wrecker service could move the tractor from the site. The right fuel tank that was  ruptured by the bal1'ier cable had lost an unknown amount of fuel prior to technicians arriving on site. The cable had cut into the tank and was temporarily  mended to prevent fuliher leakage. The cable barrier system was not broken but  was entangled in and under the tractor and trailer. The system can only be  removed by qualified DOT personnel, who were notified. DOT personnel advised  that due to weather conditions, personnel would arrival on site on the following  day to perform the procedures which will allow the tractor/trailer to be freed from  the entanglement.    The leaking fuel was leaking onto a three foot wide concrete drainage slab in the  center median and migrating to the north. The fuel migrated along the slab for a  distance of 175 feet before entering a drop box and then into a shaft leading to an  underground stonn water runoff tunnel. The fuel dumped into a drainage tunnel  that was 6 feet by 6 feet in size and lUns from east to west under the roadway.  Technicians entered the tunnel and set absorbent booms, hydrocarbon absorbent  pads, and bio matrix in the tunnel to contain the fuel.    Absorbent booms were set in place along the drainage slab to contain the fuel as it  leaked fi·om the tractor's tanks. A micro blaze emulsifier was placed in the drop  box to eradicate and break down the filel that had entered the box and the drainage  tunnel.

The responder reported product wetness on one side of the tank shell that traced back to the 165 psi pressure relief valve/device (PRV/PRD) mounted atop UTLX 208140. Further inspection of the PRV/PRD revealed that the top stem cover and cover screw were missing which allowed the stem and stem washers to move freely with subsequent product expulsion from this orifice during rail movement.

The area was isolated and First Environmental Nationwide of Decatur, Georgia was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  First Environmental Nationwide performed an investigation and discovered one (1) drum.  Apparently the drum rubbed against a piece of broken plastic.  Approximately 5 ounces of free product were released onto the warehouse floor.  First Environmental Nationwide removed the leaking drum and placed into a recovery drum.  First Environmental Nationwide applied absorbent material to recover the free liquid on the impacted warehouse floor.  The cleanup materials were placed into the recovery drum, along with the leaking pail, pending disposal coordination.  No injuries or exposures were reported. The Material Safety Data Sheet was requested and received.

He started to cough and drifted onto the unpaved shoulder. The snow and slope of the shoulder/ditch pulled him further off of the road. The driver tried to correct and get back on the road. The truck rolled over and initial reports indicate damage was done to the manway causing leakage at the seal. The incident occurred at 1:45 am EST. The shipper was notified and local authorities were called. Once we were made aware the vessel was leaking we called Environmental Remediation Services and they departed out of Fort Wayne, IN at approximately 5 am. Upon arrival at the scene, efforts were made to prevent the spill from accessing some field drainage tiles close by. This effort was successful. The release was stopped at approximately 1 pm EST with the trailer emptied into another trailer and a vacuum truck. Excavation of the contaminated soil was done immediately after the release was stopped to limit the contamination area. The site and excavated soil were tested for contamination. The site clean-up is ongoing.","Designated routing will be implemented to restrict, where possible, travel on roads without shoulders or other potential hazards that can be avoided.

SCYPHERS,REGULATORY COMPLIANCE MANAGER,3510 BARRON WAY # 200,RENO,NV,89511,Carrier,"An H20 Environmental technician was consolidating Nitric Acid waste into a 30 gal poly drum at a customers facility to make ready for shipment. The customer  Contracted us to perform the consolidating of 16x1-gal non-DOT shippable containers of waste. The waste was identified by the client as all being the same so no compatibility issues were In question. The material was poured into a new unused 30 gal poly drum outside the building in the parking lot (loading area). After all containers were added a reaction began to occur producing orange Nitric Acid  vapors from the drum's bung opening. The technician notified his superior and was instructed to keep any people away and not to close the drum but to wait until the reaction had stopped (assuming it would reach an equilibrium shortly). A neighboring business employee called the fire department upon viewing the orange vapors emitting from the drum. The local agencies responded and established an isolation zone. Eventually, once the reaction was complete, they made entry and transferred the remaining acid liquid into another new drum that contained  approximately 20 gallons of water. It was their idea to dilute the remaining 5-6 gallons of acid into the half full drum of water. Between 1 and 3 gallons of acid had apparently bubbled out of the drum during the Initial stages of the  exothermic reaction and spilled onto some plastic sheeting that was placed under the drum prior to the bulking activities. Thus a total of not more than 10 gallons was released to the air In the form of vapors. No fire occurred, just an exothermic reaction creating an evolution of acid vapors. No one was injured as the reaction began slowly and people were excluded from the area. There was no release to any waterway or native soil. The incident did not happen during the course of transportation and the release was not caused by any container failure. It is believed that one of the waste containers identified by the client must have contained a different material (one bottle residue was later found to be a pH of 5). The entire incident took place on the customers property prior to shipping.","In the future this customer's waste (due to the potential of mismarked waste containers) will be managed by lab packing the containers Instead of consolidating.

While the driver was putting the fuel into the tank, the overflow protection valve  malfunctioned allowing the extra fuel out from the vent line. When the driver saw the fuel release he shut the release of fuel from the truck off. He then notified the clerk on duty and his terminal manager. The clerk then called the fire department. The terminal manager then called Eastern Environmental Management (EEM). At approximately, 9:05 p_m., EEM arrived on scene and met with Raleigh Fire Department to access the spill situation. It was determined that the fuel release was contained to approximately 1000' of storm drain. Containment and a vacuum truck was positioned at the out fall of the storm drain and approximately 275 gallons of water was introduced on three different flushings to move the fuel to the location where it could be vacuumed out. Once the drain tile was flushed for the third time, absorbent boom was placed into the storm drain and at the outfall to ensure that all the fuel had been captured. The oil dry that was put out on the surface spill was swept and drummed up for proper disposal. The faulty valve was replaced.

Said vapor became frozen upon egress due to atmospheric temperature of 22 degrees F.   Vapor cloud was immediately noticed by attending tankerman, who performed an emergency stop to all discharge operations. Duration of spill estimated as less than 60 seconds.   Area around pump, which is located forward on the barge, was segregated by caution tape, and a cleanup contractor, Clean America Inc., was called in to remove the slight iced spillage in proper PPE.","Following the cleanup operation, the pump well was placed under negative pressure and the mechanical seat was replaced by the manufacturer.   The failed seal, which was less than 6-months old, was returned to the manufacturer for forensic determination of the cause of the premature failure. The results of that investigation have determined that the most probable cause of the failure was a buildup on condensation in the line which may have frozen overnight due to the extremely fridgid ambient temperatures causing a temporary over pressurization of the seal’s sealing device.",No,OTHER,Barge (use only if spill occurred during loading or unloading),BARGE,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7400,"VANE LINE BUNKERING, INC.",US,

As he backed, the right rear tire ran over the delivery hose and eventually tore it in two approximately three feet from the hose reel. As the liduid propane escaped from the hose it found an unknown source of ignition and caught fire. The driver exited the vehicle, activated the emergency shut down as he did so he received minor burns to his hands and face. The emergency shut-off system worked as designed and stopped the flow of gas. The driver was transported to a local hospital were he was treated and released. He returned to work a few days later.",All company drivers were reminded of the importance of staying focused on the task at hand while delivering propane.

THIS PRODUCT IS A HEATED PRODUCT THAT IS TOP-LOADED INTO A NON-SPECIFICATION CARGO TANK.  IT IS ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT FALL PROTECTION IS MINIMAL AT THIS LOCATION.  THE DRIVER STANDS ON THE TOP OF THE TRAILER TO DO THE LOADING.  THE PROCEDURE IS FOR THE LOADING PIPE TO BE CHAINED TO THE TOP OF THE TRAILER TO PROTECT AGAINST SURGES IN THE LOADING PIPE THAT MAY OCCUR FROM OVERHEATED AIR OR STEAM THAT MAY BE IN THE STREAM OF OIL.  THIS PROBLEM IS OFTEN MADE WORSE WITH STEAM-TRACED OIL LINES THAT HAVE BEEN HEATING ALL WEEKEND.  IT APPEARS THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST LOAD LOADED FROM THAT RACK ON THIS MONDAY MORNING.  MR. CLOUTIER HAD INSERTED AND SECURED THE LOADING PIPE, OPENED THE PRODUCT VALVE AND STARTED THE PUMP.  THAT IS ABOUT ALL HE REMEMBERS.  HE WAS FOUND ON THE GROUND WITH THE LOADING PIPE OUT OF THE TRAILER.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF OIL WAS ALSO ON THE TRAILER AND THE GROUND.  THE DRIVER HAD SERIOUS INJURIES FROM THE FALL, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY CONTACT WITH HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (FUEL OIL).  THE TRACTOR OR TRAILER DID NOT FAIL.  THE CARGO TANK DID NOT FAIL.  THE LOADING MACHINERY DID NOT FAIL.  IT APPEARS THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN FORCES THAT ACTED TO BLOW THE PIPE OUT OF THE TRAILER.  THIS CAUSED THE DRIVER TO BE KNOCKED FROM THE TRAILER TO THE GROUND.

WE DETERMINED THAT BUTANE HAS A BOILING POINT OF 31 F, A LEL OF 1.6% AND A UEL OF 8.4% AND ITS VAPORS ARE HEAVIER THAN AIR. THE AIR TEMPERATURE WAS COLD ENOUGH FOR THE BUTANE TO STAY MOSTLY IN A LIQUID STATE. READINGS FROM THE 5 GAS MONITOR READ NORMAL OUTSIDE OF THE IRRIGATION CANAL. WE DECIDED TO OPEN UP THE SOUTHBOUND LANES OF COLO. 85 WHILE LEAVING THE NORTHBOUND LANES CLOSED. GREG BERKHEIMER WITH CDOT SUPERVISED THE HIGHWAY CLOSURE. COLORADO STATE PATROL TROPPERS MAINTAINED A SAFE AREA SURROUNDING THE INCIDENT SITE BY DENYIMG ENTRY TO PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT A PART OF THE INCIDENT MITIGATION. RENEWABLE FIBER IS OWNER OF THE PROPERTY ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE INCIDENT CITE. THEY ALLOWED RESCUE AND HAZMAT CREWS ACCESS ONTO  THEIR PROPERTY BECAUSE IT WAS SAFER FOR THE RESCUE CREWS AND HAZMAT MITIGATION TEAMS TO OPERATE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE INCIDENT. APPOXIMATELY 150FT OF THEIR 65 FOOT FENCING WAS REMOVED TO ACCESS THE INCIDENT FROM THEIR PROPERTY.    MONITORING INSIDE THE CANAL READ 0 LEL AND THE HIGHEST VOC READING OF 9. ED FERGUSON, AN EMPLOYEE OF AMERIGAS AND A SPECIALIST WITH BUTANE AND MC331 CARGO TANKS ARRIVED ON-SCENE AND ASSISTED US WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRODUCT AND THE INTERNAL PIPING OF THE CARGO TANK. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS SAFE TO MAKE AN OFFLOAD CONNECTION AT THE REAR OF THE CARGO TANK TO OFFLOAD AS MUCH BUTANE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT MOVING THE CARGO TANK. FORT LUPTON FIRE APPLIED A FOG LINE ACROSS THE CANAL BEFORE EACH ENTRY INTO THE IRRIGATION CANAL TO DISPLACE ANY BUILDUP OF VAPORS THAT MAY HAVE ACCUMULATED BETWEEN ENTRIES.

Another company crude truck as well as a vac truck was dispatched to the scene immediately. The vac truck was sucking up the contained leak while the second truck was pulling the load off the overturned trailer through the vapor recovery line. As soon as it was safe to do so the tow truck flipped the trailer over and the truck finished unloading the little bit of crude remaining. A total of 9 bbls was spilled and lasted for 2-3 hrs.,The driver was terminated due to taking the turn to sharp and not taking the adequate precautions for his job. He was trained well and had ample experience.   Our operations manager suggested to the township manager that the intersection could be widened to prevent any reoccurence due to the fact that another truck overturned at the same intersection only days later.

The tank is located underground in the cafe's parking lot located at the rear of the business.  The driver attached the hose-end fill nozzle to the tank's fill valve and initiated the process of transferring propane into the tank.  The ACME threaded portion of the tank's fill valve, which was the connection point to the hose-end fill nozzle, tore from the body of the fill valve.  As a result, we believe approximately 20 gallons of propane were released.  The resulting propane vapor cloud came in contact with an unknown source of ignition, thus resulting in an explosion and fire.       The incident is under investigation by the Naples Fire Department, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (LP Gas Bureau) and the Florida Fire Marshal.  Notwithstanding the ongoing investigations, the specific cause of the failure of the fill valve on the ASME storage tank is unknown.  The only known witnesses to the incident are the delivery driver employee and Donald Kingston, an employee/contractor of a restaurant/bar service company who was present working on the beer tap lines at the restaurant and had parked his Nissan automobile within several feet of the hose-end nozzle assembly, and who advised the fire investigators to having seen ""fog"" coming from the area of the nozzle.  Reporting party does not believe Mr. Kingston has provided any information suggesting the cause of the failure of the hose-end nozzle-fill valve connection.  Reporting party's employee has been unable to provide a written or verbal statement concerning the cause of the failure of the hose-end nozzle-fill valve connection due to the extent of his injuries.","This incident remains under investigation by the authorities identified in Part VI above, as well as by OSHA.",Yes,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,3,0,2,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,750040,HERITAGE PROPANE,US,
