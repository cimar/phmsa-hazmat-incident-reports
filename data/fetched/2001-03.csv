THIS IS A SINGLE LANE ROADWAY IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA.  HEROUX NOTICED THAT THERE SEEMED TO BE MORE VAPOR COMING FROM THE TANK VENT THAN USUAL.  HE PULLED OVER AND PARKED THE TRUCK SO THAT HE COULD INSPECT THE TANK.  HE FOUND WHAT APPEARED TO BE A MALFUNCTIONING VACUUM VALVE ALLOWING PRESSURE TO BUILD AND VENT THROUGH THE ROAD VALVE.  WHILE HE WAS DOING HIS INSPECTION, A DERRY FIRE DEPARTMENT TRUCK PULLED IN BEHIND HIM.  BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE VENTING AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS RAINING AND VERY HUMID THERE WAS A CLOUD OF VAPOR THAT SOON ENGULFED THE TRUCK.  A LIEUTENANT FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT INQUIRED INTO WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND IF THE VAPOR WAS NORMAL. HEROUX ADVISED THAT IT WAS NORMAL FOR IT TO VENT BUT THAT AT PRESENT IT WAS A LITTLE EXCESSIVE.  HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO STAND AWAY FROM THE TRUCK.  THE LIEUTENANT HAD FIRE FIGHTERS (ASSISTED A FEW MINUTES LATER BY THE DERRY PD) STOP TRAFFIC ON THE ROAD AND CALLED THE BATTALION CHIEF.  IN APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES THE BATTALION CHIEF ARRIVED.  HE INSTRUCTED THE LIEUTENANT TO HAVE THE AIR PURITY LEVEL TESTED.  THE TEST FOUND THAT THE PURITY LEVEL WAS WITHIN LIMITS.  ED BRINKMAN, LEAD PATIENT SERVICE TECHNICIAN, ARRIVED FROM THE BRANCH OFFICE.  THE BATTALION CHIEF ALLOWED HIM TO INSPECT THE TANK. BY THIS TIME THE VAPOR CLOUD WAS LIFTING AND THE TANK WAS FOUND TO HAVE 0 PRESSURE.  THE BATTALION CHIEF SAID THAT NEITHER THE TRUCK OR THE SCENE PRESENTED ANY DANGER.  THE ROADWAY WAS REOPENED, HAVING BEEN CLOSED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 45 MINUTES.  THE LIEUTENANT TOOK HEROUX AND BRINKMAN'S NAMES AND ADVISED THEM THAT THEY WERE FREE TO LEAVE.
