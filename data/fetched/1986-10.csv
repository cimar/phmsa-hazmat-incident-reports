I TOLD THE DRIVER TO PUT THE DRUM O N ITS SIDE WHILE I GO AND LOOK FOR SOMETHING TO PLUG THE PUNCTURED DRUM, HO WEVER SINCE I COULDN'T FIND ANY PUTTY TO PLUG THE DRUM I TRIED TO PLUG IT U P WITH MY GUM. THE PUNCTURE WAS TO SEVERE SO I HAD THE DRIVER MOVE THE TRL IN THE YARD AWAY FROM THE DOCK.  I THEN REPORTED THE ACCIDENT TO SAM BERMAN , JERRY DERRICK & RICK GROVER.  THE GATES FIRE DEPT WAS CALLED TO THE SCENE .  THEY WERE HERE WITHIN 15 MINUTES. THE POLICE AND AMBULANCE WERE ALSO ON THE SCENE. WHILE THE FIRE DEPT WERE TAKING ALL THE FACTS THE AMBULANCE ATTE NDENTS WERE MAKING SURE THE EMPLOYEES WERE GIVEN MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE FIR E DEPT PUT THE PUNCTURED DRUM INTO A RECOVERY DRUM. THIS WAS THERN RETURNED TO THE SHIPPER. TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL THEY USED A FLOOR ABSORBENT. THE CAU SE OF THE ALARM WAS THE FUMES AND BEING FATAL IF INHALED.
