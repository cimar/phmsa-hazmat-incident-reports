The driver pulled out of the loading bay with the hose still connected to the trailer and to the loading lines inside the bay.  While pulling away, the coupling on the facility loading line broke and the hose was dragged away with the trailer.  Employees stopped the driver and shut both the valves on the trailer and on the facility loading lines immediately.  Some sodium hypochlorite was released outside of the loading bay and as such outside of containment.  An estimated 33 pounds of Sodium Hypochlorite 12.5% solution were released into a stormsewer line located outside of the loading bay.  Sand bags were placed in a manhole that the stormsewer lines were connected to block the flow and the storm sewer lines and associated manhole were cleaned by North Shore Environmental Services, an environmental response/remediation company.",The company supplying the driver involved in the incident was issued a corrective action request regarding the incident.

The transfer was about 50% complete when the product (Ferric Chloride) began to leak between the railcar product flange and the unloading connection flange that had been attached to the railcar for transloading. The employee supervising the transfer went on top of the railcar to shut the transfer down. As he got to the flange to shut the valve off, one of the 4 bolts that hold the flange to the railcar pulled through the flange hole on the railcar flange connection. And since the railcar had been pressurized with air for this transfer, the result was that product sprayed out of the flange hole on the railcar. The supervising employee forced the flange down and then opened the air valve to release the air off the railcar. Once the air pressure was relieved from the railcar, the release of product stopped. Approximately 20 gallons of Ferric Chloride was released. Supervising employee was not injured. No product was released off-site or impacted any waterways or drains. An environmental remediation company was called to assist in the clean-up of the released material.     AWARENESS ITEMS:   1. Two transfers of product were unloaded from the railcar the day before without a release of product.   2.Upon inspection after the release it was determined that the flange bolts were missing two of the four washers on arrival.","ROOT CAUSES:     1.EQUIPMENT FAILURE- Inadequate tools and equipment.  There is no specified standard for securement of the 4 bolt flange to the railcar.      CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:   1. Make recommendation to TRANSFLO equipmennt manager that a larger, ½ moon shaped metal plate be used on all 4 bolt flange fittings to secure the transloading fitting to railcar.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8200,Kinder Morgan Materials Services,US,

Emergency notifications were made and emergency responders were activated. Responders arrived at 1:55 PM CST and met with appropriate KCS personnel. The tankcar was secured and responders began root cause investigation.    Upon further inspection of the car, it was determined that lading was dripping from the Bottom Outlet Valve (BOV) secondary containment cap reducer unloading plug and that the plug was just barely threaded on. It was also noted that the manway on top of the tankcar had 4 loose manway bolts (3 swingbolts in the down position). The plug was tightened with a 24-inch pipe wrenchand the cap secured tightly. Also, the car was found with 1 foot+ of heel remaining in the car.    The manway bolts were tightened to tool tightness with 24-pipe wrench in the appropriate pattern. Once it was determined the leak had been stopped, the car was secured and responders demobilized.    * No injuries reported    File Note Item 19the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27--Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:  The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence.

FSTZ 814989 was carefully deramped and placed in the facility's containment area for leak source determination and remediation of spillage. Contract responders found two palletized 5 gallon pails of paint that had been compromised at their bottom seams during in-transit load shift. These damaged pails were stacked atop a wooden pallet missing top cross slats which did not provide a stable base for lading stacked atop this pallet. Insufficient blocking and bracing was also noted at the rear of the load in FSTZ 814989. Response contractors cleaned all FSTZ 814989's  interior/exterior paint spillage, as well as the spillage on the rail flatcar. Lading removed from FSTZ 814989 was returned inside FSTZ 814989 properly block and braced for further transportation. The compromised pails were earmarked for disposal along with all the spent supplies required to clean the paint spillage.","Ensure that lading within intermodal trailers/containers are properly loaded and secured for rail transit, including the use of suitable pallets for palletized lading.",No,PAIL,"Pail, open head, capacity 10 gallons or less",PAIL,No,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8200,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The car was isolated, appropriate notifications were made, and emergency responder was activated.    Upon further inspection, it was found that the shipper had offered the tank car into transportation with the ""pressure build inlet valve"" left in the open position. This caused liquid Argon to charge the onboard vaporizor. The onboard vaporizor is utilized for flashing the liquid to a gas for unloading to highway cargo trucks. The onboard vaporizor unit had several holes/cracks which caused the lading to release from this ancilary vaporizor unit. Also, the car was found with a depleted vacuum to the annular space which caused lading product to build pressure and occasionally vent from the regulator valve more often. The ""pressure build inlet valve"" was manually closed to prevent any further venting of lading from the vaporizor unit.    Air Liquide sent a representative to make sure car didnt need any further repairs before being sent to its final destination. The following day the tank car was vented of pressure and thus de-icing the half frozen regulator valve making it completely operable again.  Air liquide notified carrier that all valves and devices were working properly and that the package was DOT compliant for transportation.     *No injuries were reported    File Note Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:  The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.    The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs.",No,TANK CAR,,113A90W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

RDWY 121610 was carefully deramped off its rail flatcar and placed in the facility's containment/unloading dock area for leak source determination and remediation of spillage. Contract responders found one palletized 5 gallon pail of paint that had been compromised during in-transit load shift. The damaged pail sustained a bottom seam split possibly initiated by the down force of heavy lading stacked atop these palletized paint pails. Insufficient blocking and bracing was also noted at the rear of the load in RDWY 121610. Response contractors cleaned all RDWY 121610's interior/exterior paint spillage, as well as the spillage on the rail flatcar. The compromised pail was placed into an overpack drum.

LAKEVILLE MOTOR EXPRESS HAD DISCOVERED THE RELEASE AT APPROXIMATELY 0100 HOURS. LAKEVILLE MOTOR EXPRESS INFORMED ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT THAT THE RELEASE WAS FROM A 330-GALLON TOTE TANK CONTAINING A SODIUM HYDROXIDE SOLUTION 30% (LIQUID). THE RELEASE HAD IMPACTED THE TRAILER FLOOR, THE PARKING LOT, LOADING DOCK AND HAD ALSO IMPACTED A STORM DRAIN CATCH BASIN. ENVIRONMENTAL  MANAGEMENT MOBILIZED ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION, LLC (SUBCONTRACTOR) TO RESPOND TO THE RELEASE. ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION ARRIVED ON SITE. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE TOTE TANK WAS IN A HARD-PLASTIC OUTER CONTAINER. THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE WAS COMING FROM AN UNKNOWN LOCATION ON THE BOTTOM OF THE INNER TOTE TANK. THE PRODUCT IN THE LEAKING TOTE TANK WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER TOTE TANK. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT APPROXIMATELY 50 GALLONS OF THE PRODUCT WERE RELEASED. ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION THEN BEGAN CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS OF THE IMPACTED AREAS. ABSORBENTS WERE APPLIED TO THE IMPACTED AREAS TO RECOVER THE FREE LIQUIDS. THE IMPACTED ABSORBENTS WERE RECOVERED AND PLACED INTO TWO (2) 55-GALLON DRUMS. ABSORBENT BOOM WAS PLACED IN THE STORM DRAIN CATCH BASIN AND WOULD BE LEFT IN PLACE UNTIL A RAIN EVENT TO ENSURE ANY  REMAINING RESIDUE IS RECOVERED. THE TRAILER FLOOR, PARKING LOT AND THE LOADING DOCK AREA WERE THEN DECONTAMINATED UTILIZING VINEGAR. AFTER CLEANING ALL SURFACES WITH VINEGAR, THE AREAS WERE TESTED FOR PH. ALL PH READINGS FOR THE AREAS WERE NEUTRAL. ON 10/09/2012 ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION RETURNED TO THE SITE AND REMOVED THE ABSORBENT BOOM FROM THE STORM DRAIN CATCH BASIN AND PLACED THE BOOM INTO A 30-GALLON DRUM.  ALL DRUMMED WASTE WAS STAGED ON SITE PENDING DISPOSAL ARRANGEMENTS TO BE MADE BY LAKEVILLE MOTOR EXDPRESS. DUE TO THE DAMAGED TOTE TANK BEING INSIDE OF THE OUT PACKAGING, IT COULD NOT BE DTERMINED AS TO THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE RELEASE OR HOW THE INNER CONTAINER FAILED. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO HAVE THE DAMAGED CONTAINER SHIPPED BACK TO THE SHIPPER. THE SHIPPER IS TO INSPECT THE DAMAGED CONTAINER AND DETERMINE THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE RELEASE.","Our company will make every effort to prevent any future incidents like this from happening in the future. We recently formed a hazardous materials team of qualified instructors who will provide training that's in addition to what's already in place. All dockworkers and drivers will be retrained on the proper handling of hazardous materials, the proper procedures to follow in the case of an emergency and the need to be aware of their surroundings. Our facility is closed Saturday afternoon through Sunday when this incident began. We do, however, have regional drivers that arrive throughout the weekend and will be sending out notifications to them to perform yard checks of the facility and to alert us of any leaks or spills.

The free product released to the soils adjacent to the roadway.  Live Oak Sheriff’s Department, Local Fire Department, and local responders were dispatched to assess the site.  The diesel fuel released to the soils adjacent to the roadside.  There was no impact to waterways or threat to enter state waters.  MidState Environmental was contracted to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, MidState Environmental used a vacuum truck to recover the free liquid, and secured the site, pending excavation of impacted soils.  MidState Environmental returned to excavate impacted soils, pull confirmation samples, and restore site to preexisting condition.  Environmental consultant was also hired to oversee response actions and site closure.  There were no injuries or exposures as a result of the release.","C.L.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected PROX 40968 and determined that the closed liquid valve was leaking from its loose closure plug. The responder tool tightened the loose closure plug which significantly slowed the product release. A follow-up inspection by contract responders discovered that the liquid valve's 3 inch ball valve was not seating properly due to Teflon tape debris caught between the ball valve and the valve's gasket seat. The responders depressured PROX 40968 and removed the debris. Afterwards, no further product seepage was observed after the responders restored the 15 psi nitrogen blanket within PROX 40968.

Approximately 2 ounces of  2-Ethyl Hexyl Acrylate leaked into the rock ballast and evaporated. A catch pan was placed under the railcar to catch additional leaks.  No tank car to cargo tank transfers had been taken out of this tank car. A tank car arrival inspection had been conducted with 24 hours and no leak was discovered that time. No unloading connections had been attached and no valves were operated. The shipper (DOW) was notified and contacted RESCAR to coordinate repairs. Less than a liquid ounce of 2-Ethyl Hexyl Acrylate was collected in the catch pan between 10/24/2012 and 11/2/2012.    RESCAR technicians arrived at the terminal on 11/2/2012 to attempt to repair tank car and stop the leak. They made contact with DOW and were told to attempt to tighten the bolts on the bottom flange to stop the leak. Only two of the eight bolts even moved slightly. The RESCAR crew re-inspected the tank car about 90 minutes later and could still see moisture around the gasket. No drips have been witnessed or product seen in the drain pan in over a week. No railcar switches on Track 9 will be conducted until advised to do so. Exact cause of leaking flange is unknown.",Root Cause: Possible leak or damage to the flange gasket.     Corrective Actions:  1. Notify railcar shipper of leaking railcar.- COMPLETED- 10/24/2012  2. Work with RESCAR to attempt repairs on-site.- COMPLETED-11/2/2012  3.

The transload pump operator immediately shut the pump down and reported the release to the terminal manager. There was an estimated two liquid ounces of ethanol that was released onto the asphalt from the leaking strainer basket. Oil absorbents were placed over the release and swept up. The investigation revealed that the O-ring of the filter lid was mis-aligned and did not properly fit when lid was closed. The O-ring on the lid was re-adjusted and the lid was tightened to stop the leak. The O-ring was then replaced to prevent re-occurrence. No stormwater drains were impacted by the ethanol release.  Notifications were made to the Chief dispatcher of Norfolk Southern, the terminal owner.","Roanoke transloading pump operators were re-trained to inspect O-rings more closely before closing the filter lid. Any warped, worn, or damaged O-rings will be immediately replaced. Spill pans will be placed under the filters for the first transfers after the O-rings are replaced or re-aligned as a precautionary measure to capture potential leaks.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Kinder Morgan Materials Services,US,

The car was placed in bad order hold status pending contact with the shipper. On 10/26 the shipper authorized repairs and remediation to be performed by M&M Protection. Once authorized the car was moved to the repair track. M&M responded on 10/29 and discovered that the manway gasket was cracked/brokemn. They installed a new gasket and sealed the tank car. They also found a defective o-ring on the vacuum relief valve and replaced the o-ring.

The weight of the palletized lading partially crushed and cracked the inner receptacle releasing product within. The remaining product in this IBC was transferred into another suitable IBC. Interior and exterior spillage on FSTZ 813860 and the railcar was cleaned with a hot water/detergent solution.

V1 stated that this impact caused V1 to run into the guard rail and then flip over the guardrail. V1 stated that both the truck and trailer rolled completely over, landing in the ditch along side I-95 Northbound at Mile Marker 90.3 just before theTydings Bridge. V1 contacted the Pilot Flying J management team, as well as the first responders that came to the scene for mediation. Pilot Flying J then contacted their third party clean up contractor to survey and then clean the affected areas. V1's trailer sustained damage to the front compartment, which resulted in 3,200 gallons of Diesel Fuel being spilled.","All Pilot Flying J drivers receive safety training, which teaches them to always be alert and defensive when driving. After reviewing the details of the event, it appears that it was not a lack of driver ability/awareness that lead to this taking place.

The hopper car was isolated. The shipper, Orica Canada Inc., was notified via Chemtrec, report #2012-10-18-00117. SWS Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the Stanley Yard. SWS met with the CSXT Mechanical Department and found the hopper bottom slide gate closure partially opened. The hopper slide gate was properly secured, all spilled material was removed from the tracks and drummed for disposal. The shipper representative, Paul Kaupas, was notified of the situation found. The product release was secured and NAHX 508645 was released for disposition.  This incident did not require a special move.

At approximately 6:47am Mr. Lewis failed to maintain control of the MMU causing the vehicle to leave the road, striking a guardrail and overturning down an embankment, coming to rest against a tree. The MMU was loaded with approximately 22,000LBS of Oxidizer emulsion (UN3139),  90 1.1 B Detonators (UN0030) and 90 1.1D Boosters (UN0042). No emulsion was spilled from the tank and a small amount leaked from the broken line (Less than 1 Gallon). Both Dets and Boosters remained secured in their IME-22 magazines undamaged. A small amount of diesel fuel, engine oil, and antifreeze leaked from the vehicle and Hepaco, LLC, an Orica third party environmental Response Company cleaned incident scene.

UNIVERSITY AVENUE,URBANA,IL,61801,Carrier,"On 10/3/12, between 7:00-7:20 a.m. Illini FS Inc. employees Joe Graning & Ted Toliver were in the process of filling two 1,450 gallon anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks that were placed onto a single trailer. The dual 1,450 gallon nurse tanks were on the southeast side of the anhydrous ammonia riser. At the time of the incident Mr. Graning was making connections to the 1,45O gallon nurse tank stationed closest to the anhydrous ammonia riser. Also, during this time Danial Gaskin another Illini FS Inc employee was in the process of disconnecting dual 1,450 gallon nurse tanks place onto a single trailer from a truck on the west side of the anhydrous ammonia riser closest to the 30,000.•gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tank. Mr. Graning had just completed making the connection of the vapor host end valve at the riser to the liquid/vapor fill valve on the 1,450 gallon nurse tank. Just prior to Mr. Graning making the connections, Mr. Toliver had retrieved an acme gasket as Mr. Graning was having some difficulty making the connections. Mr. Graning informed Mr. Toliver that he was able to make the connection of the vapor hose end valve to the liquid/vapor fill valve on the 1,450 gallon nurse tank and the acme gasket that Mr. Toliver originally retrieved was not needed.    Mr.Granlng then proceeded to connect the liquid line hose end angle valve to the liquid/vapor fill valve on the 1,450.gallon nurse tank. Mr. Graning is unsure as to what happened next, as anhydrous ammonia released from the liquid line hose end angle valve. Mr. Graning stated he yelled ""OH EXPLETIVE"" & the next thing that he recalls was anydrous ammonia releasing from the end of the liquid line hose end angle valve. Mr. Gmning stated that possibly the valve hand wheel on the liquid line hose end angle valve turned in the open position, but is unsure of how it might have occurred. Mr. Toliver had his back to Mr. Graning facing north as he was putting the unused acme gasket back onto a wire storage hook. During the on-set of the release of anhydrous ammonia, Danial Gaskin avoided the release by heading west under the 30,000 & 18,000 gallon anhydrous ammonia storage tanks & ending north of the anhydrous .ammonia riser near the 150 gallon emergency water container.  Mr. Gaskin asked Mr. Toliver where Mr. Graning was, Mr. Toliver stated he was unsure as to the location of Mr. Graning. Mr. Gaskin instructed Mr. Toler to stay in the emergency water as he went to find Mr. Graning. Mr. Gaskin stated he found Mr. Graning between the anhydrous ammonia riser and the fuel storage tanks in the anhydrous ammonia vapor cloud. Mr. Gaskin went into the anhydrous ammonia vapor cloud and led Mr. Graning out of the vapor cloud & then guided Mr. Graning into the 150 gallon emergency water container that Mr. Toliver was currently in.    Mr. Gaskin then instructed Joe Cannon, an employee of Iilini FS Inc. to contact 911 & stop the leak from the liquid line hose end angle valve at the anhydrous ammonia riser.

Each compartment had a capacity of 1000 gallons.  The front compartment contained 700 gallons of diesel fuel, compartment 3 contained 650 gallons of diesel fuel and compartment 3 was empty.  The truck was heading northbound of I29 and just north of exit 73 out driver heard a loud band under the truck.  He  looked in his mirrors and saw something laying on the road.  He then looked ahead to check traffic so that he could get to the side of the road, stopped and exited the truck which was quickly engulfed in flames.  911 was called and the SD Hwy Patrol, Tea Police and Fire departments from both Sioux Falls and Tea responded along with the SDDOT Hwy Dept.  Northboud traffic had already stopped and once responders arrived the northbound traffic was detoured.  Once the fire was extinguished and the remains of the truck cooled down, it was determined that compartment 1 which had contained 700 gallons of diesel fuel was empty. Compartment 2, which still contained fuel had a small leak on the emergency valve on the bottom of the tank.  The leak was contained with absorbent socks and pads until another of out trucks arrived to pump the fuel out of the compartment.  We also pumped the fuel out of the engin fuel tanks, which were not leading, to prevent another release.  While we were pumping the fuel the Hwy Department cleaned up the inside lane, set up the inside lane, set up cones and opened one nortbound lane to taffic.  As to what caused the release and fire, first responders found a U-joint with the slip joint attached at the start of the fuel stain on the pavement.  They also found a 2 inch Victualic pipe connecting clamp and part of an emergency valve a short distance away.  Looking at the truck, when we got it back to out facility, we found taht the driveshaft between the hanger bearing and the first differential had come off.  One of the U-joint cup clamps was still in place but the other one was missing.  One boldt that holds that clamp in place was missing and the other bolt was broken off.  We are assuming that the missing bolt came loose and vibrated out, putting excessive stress on the remaining bolt until it failed causing the driveshaft to drop down and swing aroung wildly under the truck.  the shaft hit the emergency valve and broke the casting, damaging it so severely that it leakedit also appeared to have hit the 2 inch pipe that runs from the gasoline pump under the truck to the meter at the rear of the truck, breaking the victaulic clamp and causing the gasoline residue in the line to ignite and this in turn caused the leaking diesel fuel to ignite.  Most of the diesel burned up as it leaded from the truck.  The report we have from out environmental consultant states that we will have to remove some topsoil and replace it with clean soil and seed it.  We will also have to have some of the concrete road sur",,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC306,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,63739,Stern Oil Co. Inc.,US,

He found the 1900 tank with 25 gallons inside and began to make his connections. This location has a concrete wall around the tank he is filling. Jose started the unload process and after a while noticed that there was an unusually strong smell of bleach coming from the area. As he went walking back to the tank location he noticed that the tank had just over 800 gallons in it but immediately noticed that there was bleach coming from under the door of the fill room, so he ran back to the tanker and closed all his valves. The driver ran back through the alley to the tank, climbed up on the fence and noticed that the main valve and the valve coming out of the containment were both left open. He climb to the top of the fence and lay his body across it, and was able to close the outside valve.    It was later discovered by Jaimie Johnson (AUC Miami Branch Manager) when the owner of Luli Pool arrived onsite and opened the fill room that the leak was due to a broken pipe approx 3 feet downstream of the valve outside of the containment. The pipe had a folded pool liner laid across it and footprints as if it had been used as a stepping point to gain access to the tank. This appears to be the cause of the broken pipe and there is no way that the driver could have seen this from outside the fill area.    Cliff Berry (Chemical Cleanup Company) was called to the scene to handle the recovery of the bleach, but by the time they arrived all the product was either down the drain in the parking lot or absorbed into the pervious soil next to the tank.  NRC was contacted and a report was made # 10257414.  After completing the investigation and concluding that this was not the drivers fault but the customers, NRC was again contacted by the VP of Operations and was told that a reversal NRC report would be made under # 1027436.","The owner of the pool company mentioned that they had been victims of a robbery 2 nights prior to this  event. He stated that the robbers gained access to their tank and fill-room and were able to drain the  tank completely dry (claiming 1300 gallons lost to theft). Though the pipe could have been broken during  the robbery as it appears to have been used as a stepping point, the spill could still have been avoided  if the pool company would have followed procedure and ensured that the main valve was being closed  at the end of business each day. The tank would have been filled by the driver according to standard  procedure, and the pool company staff would have discovered the leak when they started working as they  attempted to open the main valve.",Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,1535,Allied Universal Corp,US,
