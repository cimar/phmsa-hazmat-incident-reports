ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WERE WARM WITH LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND VERY LITTLE WIND.  NO SIGNIFICANT RAIN FALL HAD OCCURRED WITHIN THE PREVIOUS 30 DAYS.  THE PRODUCT WAS BEING FILTERED THROUGH A TWO INCH STAINLESS STEEL, ONE MICRON FILTER CANISTER VIA CHEMICAL HOSE.  THE EMPLOYEES WERE FOLLOWING AN ESTABLISHED STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR TOP LOADING AND FILTERING WITH A MICRON FILTER.  THE TANKER, FILTER AND LOADING RACK WERE ALL APPROPRIATELY BONDED AND GROUNDED.  THE PRIMARY LOADING EMPLOYEE WAS VISUALLY OBSERVING THE LOADING OF THE TOLUENE IN THE NEAR VICINITY OF THE FILLING OPERATION.  JUST AS THE TANKER WAS NEARING 100% OF THE SCHEDULED DELIVERY AMOUNT A FLASH FIRE OCCURRED IN THE VAPORS ABOVE THE MANY WAY.  THE LOADER WAS LIFTED OFF OF THE TANKER LOADING PLATFORM BY THE INITIAL SHOCK WAVE AND THROWN TO THE GROUND.  THE EMPLOYEE RECEIVED SECOND AND THIRD DEGREE BURNS PRIMARILY TO THE HANDS, FOREARMS AND BACK.  THE LOADING ASSISTANT WAS IN THE ADJACENT AREA CONVERSING WITH THE LOADER AT THE TIME OF THE FLASH FIRE.  BOTH EMPLOYEES INDICATE THAT NO GAUGING, SAMPLING, HOSE HANDLING OR OTHER OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY WAS TAKING PLACE AT THE TIME OF THE FLASH FIRE.  THE LOADING ASSISTANT RECEIVED ""SUNBURN"" LIKE BURNS TO THE FACE AND LIPS AND FIRST TO SECOND DEGREE BURNS ON THE LEFT FOREARM.  BOTH EMPLOYEES AT THE TIME OF THE FLASH FIRE WERE FOLLOWING SUPERIOR'S PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT POLICY FOR THE TASKS THEY WERE COMPLETING.  TWO UV/IR DETECTORS WITHIN THE AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION SYSTEM ALARMED AND INITIATED AN AUTOMATIC DELUGE FOAM-WATER FIRE SUPPRESSION SYSTEM.  THE FIRE ALARM PANEL MADE IMMEDIATE AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATION TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND RELEASED THE SECURITY GATE FOR FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONSE.  THE FACILITY WAS EVACUATED IN THREE MINUTES AND FOURTEEN SECONDS.  THE FIRE WAS COMPLETELY EXTINGUISHED IN ONE MINUTE AND SEVENTEEN SECONDS FROM THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE FOAM WATER SOLUTION. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND AMBULANCE SERVICE ARRIVED ON SCENE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES OF NOTIFICATION TO TREAT AND TRANSPORT THE INJURED EMPLOYEES.  NO RESPONSE ACTION WAS REQUIRED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TEAM.  THE FIRE WAS COMPLETELY SUPPRESSED BY THE TIME OF THEIR ARRIVAL AND NO LIQUID RELEASE OF TOLUENE HAD OCCURRED.

INITIAL REPORTS SUGGEST THAT TECHSOL DID NOT OPERATE THE VALVE ROD AS REQUIRED UNDER 49 CFR 174.67(F) TO ENSURE THAT THE BOTTOM OUTLET VALVE WAS PROPERLY SEATED BEFORE OPENING THE OUTER, REDUNDANCY VALVE.  ULTIMATELY, APPROXIMATELY 18,500 GALLONS OF COAL TAR LIGHT OIL WAS RELEASED THROUGH THIS BOTTOM VALVE. TECHSOL INITIATED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE.

OUR BACK UP DRIVER, GLEN GEIHL ARRIVED TO HELP CONTAIN THE PROBLEM ABOUT 12.45 PM.  GLEN REMOVED 196 GALLONS FROM THE TRAILER # 30, THAT WAS DELIVERING THE FUEL. THE ORIGINAL B/L 72407 SHOWS 2200 GALLONS OF ""TAX EXEMPT"" DIESEL.  I TOOK A PICTURE OF THE METER ON THE 2ND TRANSPORT TO ARRIVE AS IT FINISHED REMOVING DIESEL FROM THE CON-VAULT.  THE METER SHOWS 5877 GALLONS REMOVED FROM THE CON-VAULT.  AFTER I LEFT THE SCENE, THE METER MOVED UP TO 5960 GALLONS.  THE VAULT ONLY HOLDS 6, 000 GALLONS.  IF WE REMOVED 5960 FROM THE CONTAINER, 196 FROM THE DELIVERING TRAILER = 6156. FRED, THE PURCHASING AGENT FOR THE LARAMIE HIGHWAY DEPT. HAS BEEN ORDERING FUEL FOR THAT TANK FOR MANY YEARS.  IT IS NOT LOGICAL THAT HE WOULD ORDER MORE THAN THE TANK WOULD HOLD BY OVER 200 GALLONS.  CONSEQUENTLY, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT MORE THAN 100 GALLONS WERE SPILLED ON THE GROUND.  THE SPILL WAS CONTAINED BY THE LARAMIE HIGHWAY BY STACKING SAND AROUND THE AREA. EVERYONE ACTED QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE DIESEL FUEL.  WE CONTACTED THE PROPER AUTHORITIES ASAP.  WE LEFT OUR TRAILER #22 TO CONTAIN THE PUMPED OFF DIESEL UNTIL THE HIGHWAY DEPT. COULD MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FUEL.  THE VARIANCE BETWEEN THE PICTURE AND THE ACTUAL REMOVED GALLONS IS CHALLENGING.  NORMALLY, WHEN THE METER STOPS THE TANK IS EMPTY.  THE ONLY LOGICAL ANSWER FOR THE INCREASE IN GALLONS IS THAT SOME OF THE FUEL WAS ALREADY IN THE AREA BETWEEN THE CONCRETE AND THE INTERIOR BLADDER.  THE FUEL THAT WAS IN THIS AREA DRAINED OVER TO THE SPOT WERE OUR TRUCK WAS PUMPING THE FUEL OUT AND INTO TRAILER #22.  WHILE GLEN AND I WERE AT THE SCENE, GLEN TESTED THE EMERGENCY VENT.  WE CHECKED WITH EATON METAL OF CASPER, WY WHO REPORTED TO ME THAT THE EMERGENCY VENT WILL OPEN WITH AS 8 OZ OF INTERNAL PRESSURE.  GLEN AND I WERE ON TOP OF THE TANK AND GLEN TRIED TO LIFT THE EMERGENCY RELIEF VENT.  IT WOULD NOT BUDGE.  THE VENT HAD FAILED TO OPEN DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH I AM NOT AWARE.  BUT AT THE MOMENT HE TRIED TO LIFT IT, THE EMERGENCY VENT WOULD NOT OPEN.  THE PICTURES THAT WERE TAKEN SHOW MINOR SPILLAGE RUNNING NORTH FROM THE CON-VAULT.  THE PICTURES OF THE TANK, SHOW MANY SPLITS IN THE CONCRETE. THE",,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,250,,US,

UPON ARRIVAL AT THE CWM-LCH FACILITY CONTAINER MANAGEMENT UNIT, SITE PERSONNEL OPENED THE VAN TRAILER AND IMMEDIATELY DISCOVERED THE LEAK; SEE THE ATTACHED PHOTOGRAPH.  IT APPEARED THAT ONE TRANSFORMER LEAKED SOME PCB OIL (CAS NO. 1336-36-3, DOT ID NO. UN2315, HAZARD CLASS 9) AND A SECOND TRANSFORMER CAME IN CONTACT WITH THIS LEAKED PCB OIL.  NO PCB'S LEAKED FROM OR THROUGH THE STEEL FLOOR OF THE VAN TRAILER.  CWM-LCH PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY OVER PACKED THE TWO TRANSFORMERS WHICH HAD PCB'S ON THEIR OUTSIDE CASINGS; THE SIX OTHER TRANSFORMERS IN THE LOAD WERE ALSO OVER PACKED AS A PRECAUTION.  ALSO, IN THE AFTERNOON OF OCTOBER 14, 2004, THE AREA OF THE SPILL IN THE VAN WAS CORDONED OFF TO PREVENT TRACKING OF THE PCB'S FROM THE VAN TRAILER AND THE SPILLED MATERIAL WAS CONTAINED AND LATER REMOVED.  BY NOON ON OCTOBER 15, 2004, THE TRAILER WAS DECONTAMINATED BY TRIPLE RINSING THE SPILL AREA WITH DIESEL FUEL IN ACCORDANCE WITH 40 CFR 761; CONFIRMATION OF DECONTAMINATION USING PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN 40 CFR 761 IS UNDERWAY WITH LABORATORY TESTS OF SWABS BEING CONDUCTED.  THE REPORTABLE QUANTITY (RQ) FOR PCB'S IS ONE POUND AND THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF THE SPILLED MATERIAL WAS ABOUT ONE POUND.  TO PROVIDE A CLOSER ESTIMATE OF WHAT VOLUME (AND WEIGHT) ACTUALLY SPILLED, A TEST WAS DONE TO OCTOBER 20, 2004.  WATER WAS SPILLED ON THE SAME SURFACE UNTIL IT VISUALLY APPROXIMATED THE EXTENT OF THE ""FOOTPRINT"" OF THE ORIGINAL SPILL.  FROM OBSERVATIONS OF THIS TEST, IT IS NOW CONCLUDED THAT ONLY ABOUT ONE-QUARTER OF A PINT, OR ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF A POUND OF PCB'S ACTUALLY SPILLED IN THE VAN TRAILER.  THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE SPILL IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.  PRELIMINARY, IT APPEARS THAT THESE TRANSFORMERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PACKAGED WITHIN SECONDARY CONTAINMENT DUE TO THEIR AGE AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE LOADED ON THE VAN.  THE GENERATOR OF THE WASTES IS: THE TERMCO CO 1249 JOEL BLANCHARD ST. PARKS, LA 70582 THE FIRST TRANSPORTER OF THE WASTE WAS: CEI 1129A FLORIDA BLVD. WALKER, LA 70785  THE SECOND TRANSPORTER OF THE WASTE WAS: CWM TRANSPORTATION, INC. 7123 JOHN BRANNON ROAD SULPHUR, LA 70665  FROM THE ATTACHED ""NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE MANIFEST NO. WM-015054, CEI PICKED UP THE LOAD ON OCTOBER 13, 2004 AND DELIVERED IT TO THE CWM 10-DAY STORAGE FACILITY LOCATED AT THE CWM FACILITY.  CWM TRANSPORTATION THEN DELIVERED THE LOAD TO THE CONTAINER MANAGEMENT UNIT ON OCTOBER 14, 2004.  PRESENTLY, THE TRANSFORMERS ARE OVER PACKED AND STORED IN THE PERMITTED CONTAINER MANAGEMENT UNIT, AWAITING TRANSPORT OFF-SITE TO AN APPROVED DISPOSAL FACILITY.

THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN BY APRIA HEALTHCARE EMPLOYEE CHRIS L FRAUENDORFER FROM THE APRIA HEALTHCARE, LIVERMORE, CA OFFICE.  FRAUENDORFER WAS TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 55 MPH WHEN HE LOOKED DOWN TO PICK UP AN UNKNOWN OBJECT.  IN DOING SO HE ALLOWED THE VEHICLE TO DRIFT ONTO THE RIGHT SHOULDER.  HE THEN LOOKED UP AND OBSERVED A 1998 FORD CONTOUR PARKED ALONG THE RIGHT SHOULDER. HE SWERVED TO THE LEFT IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID THE PARKED VEHICLE.  HE WAS UNABLE TO AVOID A COLLISION WITH THE REAR OF THE PARKED VEHICLE.  BOTH VEHICLES OVERTURNED AND CAME TO REST DOWN AN EMBANKMENT.  THE LIVERMORE-PLEASANTON FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED AND TREATED FRAUENDORFER FOR MINOR INJURIES.  HE WAS TRANSPORTED TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR EXAMINATION AND LATER RELEASED WITH MINOR INJURIES. THERE WERE NO PASSENGERS IN THE FORD CONTOUR.  FIRE PERSONNEL FOUND A WHITE VAPOR CLOUD COMING FROM THE APRIA HEALTHCARE VEHICLE AND CYLINDERS, MEDICAL COMPRESSED OXYGEN, LYING ON THE GROUND.  UPON MAKING ENTRANCE TO THE VEHICLE CARGO AREA THEY FOUND THAT THE LIQUID OXYGEN THAT WAS LEAKING FROM THE CARGO TANK WAS DISSIPATING IN A NON-HAZARDOUS AREA.  THE MSDS WAS LOCATED IN THE VEHICLE.  A SECONDARY INSPECTION FOUND NO OTHER PRIMARY HAZARDS.  THE EXAMINATION CONDUCTED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL FAILED TO FIND A LEAK IN THE CARGO TANK.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE LOSS OF LIQUID OXYGEN WAS A RESULT OF THE CARGO TANK BEING INVERTED AND LIQUID ESCAPING THROUGH THE VENTING SYSTEM.  THE LIQUID OXYGEN HAD FINISHED VENTING OFF BEFORE CAL TRANS ARRIVED ON THE SCENE FOR ACCIDENT RELATED CLEAN UP.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NO FIRE HAZARD AND DEPARTED.  THE CYLINDERS (OXYGEN, COMPRESSED) WERE RECOVERED BY APRIA HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL WHO RESPONDED TO THE SCENE.
