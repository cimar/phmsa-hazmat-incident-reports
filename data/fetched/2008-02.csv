The same was corrected and the dome cover was dogged down properly.,The shipper should always do a shake tesk before allowing the trucker to proceed on the road with a hazmat shipment.  This would involve the trucker pulling forward or backwards at a speed of about 5 miles per hour and hitting the brakes on his rig.  This will reveal a leak before the shipment is moved over the road.,No,TANK INTERMODAL,Steel portable tank,IM101,Yes,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,500,"Horizon Lines, LLC",US,

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder immediately inspected GATX 16375. The responder noted that all seals were intact and the odor was emanating from the manway cover closure. Some dampness mixed with dried commodity residue was noted around the base of the manway nozzle. The responder found all six manway securement bolts less than tool tight (five approx. 1/2 turn loose and one at a full turn loose). Responder properly tool tightened these loose securement bolts, but the commodity odor persisted. Afterwards, GATX 16375 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard awaiting further inspection of the manway gasket seal and the cleaning of the spillage around the manway nozzle. At 0945 hrs. PST, 2/09/08, a shipper response team arrived and installed a new manway gasket after they discovered that the manway gasket was missing in GATX 16375. The gasket was applied and the manway resecured by 1030 hrs. PST, 2/09/08. Another shipper contractor neutralized the spillage on the shell on GATX 16375 which was completed by 1230 hrs.

We dispatched our maintenance crew to go to the scene of the incident to verify what type of material was leaking.  Without entering the container, our maintenance crew was able to determine that the leaking substance was paint from visual and from the fumes released from the container.  At that point, we dispatched a environmental crew for remediation of the container.  From photos as well as the reporting from the environmental crew, the cause of the spill was due to package failure of one of the pails.  It was damaged due to having too much weight put upon the packaging.  The environmental team took the necessary steps to properly clean up the spill and dispose of the product.",Notification has been sent to the shipper of this cargo that a release had happened.

The car was dripping product from the bottom outlet valve because the bottom valve operating handle was not secured and had fallen into the open position.  The car was isolated and the shipper, Cargill, Inc, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report # 2008-02-12-00033). Sunpro, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that railroad personnel had closed the bottom outlet valve operating handle and pinned it in the closed position.  Contractor personnel removed the bottom outlet cap, turned over the cap gasket, and secured the cap wrench tight. The leak was secured and the car released for transport.

Once this happened the valves at the two compartments were closed, the material on the pavement was contained and the clean up began.

SWS arrived around 1330 hours and tracks were locked and flagged by TASD Carmen on duty and SWS employees began work on the car. SWS employees discovered a 3"" top ball valve handle was loose. They tightened the valve packing gland nut and closed the valve and observed valve for sometime allowing pressure to build up. No product leaked from the valve stem or the ball as it had done before.

Driver preformed walk around on trailer to look for any problems. During this walk around he opened the internal and external valve on the trailer to inspect them. Driver left the valves open and went on top of trailer and began inspecting the trailer and getting prepared to begin loading process. This is a facility that requires the driver to do all the loading himself. The driver spent some time on top of trailer to familiarize himself with the loading process. While doing this the driver forgot that he had left the valves open on the rear of the trailer. The driver began loading the product into the tank, and realized he had left the valves open. The driver shut down the product and ran to the rear of the trailer and shut the valves. Before he could get the valves shut 70 gallons of product had leaked on the ground.","Superior Carriers Inc., typically does not allow a driver to load his or her own trailer without very specific training for a specific facility.

The last delivery to this tank was Friday 2/29/08 @ 3:30PM.  The exact time the valve was opened and/or close can not be determined because product can be unloaded with the bleeder valve in either position. The bleeder valve is not in plain view of the driver unloading the product.

The car was bad ordered and the car was not sent over the yard hump. The shipper was notified via Chemtrec, and the car was isolated on the shop track. CSXT Hazmat manager T. J. Mannas inspected TIMX 65759 on 02/15/08, and noted one of the tote bins protruding from the ""R"" side door approximately 24 inches. The entire load (32 bins in 2 x 16 pattern) had shifted. A ""toe"" board (2"" x 10"" on edge) at the base of the ""R"" side door was splintered by the protruding tote bin. A tarp was placed over the ""R"" side door to prevent moisture from entering TIMX 65759. T. Mannas discussed this with Elkem Metal Company personnel at Pittsburgh, PA and Ashtabula, OH. Dryburg Company, Pittsburgh, PA personnel and Eagle Construction + Environmental Services (ECESI), Findlay, OH personnel along with T. Mannas opened the ""L"" side door on 02/19, 2008. A completely deflated D.I.D (disposable inflatable dunnage) as blocking and bracing was found in the center of the load. The D.I.D. was punctured. Several of the tote bins inside TIMX 65759 had released product inside the boxcar. No product had exited the boxcar. On 02/25/08, T. Mannas met Elkem Metal Company, Ashtabula, OH representative and ECESI representative. All concurred that the transfer and repair of the containers should not be attempted until weather conditions permit, (i.e. no  rain nor snow).

During the container filling process the operator noticed a drop in material volume,checked the transfer line and discovered an open valve.Aluminum Sulfate 48% leaked from a damaged 1.5 inch drain valve located in the transfer line. Prior to unloading the tank trailer, operators discovered that the three 1.5 inch drain valves in the transfer line were frozen in the open position. Steam was applied to the valves and apparently when the operator closed the valves the stem connecting the ball assembly to the handle broke on one of the valves, this allowed the handle to turn to the closed position and the ball assembly to remain in the open position.The Aluminum Sulfate leaked into a swale area of approximately 3,300 sq. ft. UNIVAR employees responded by covering spill and creating a dam of Soda Ash to contain and neutralize the material. Our Emergency Response Contractor responded with heavy equipment and secured the spill and began the recovery process. Due to theweather conditions (temperatures in the thirties and snow on the ground) the Aluminum Sulfate tended to solidify assisting in the clean up process. The contractor was able to scoop up the material and contaminated soils into sixcontainers totaling approximately 200 tons, they remained on site until the evening of February 2 to ensure all cleanup was completed.",The CPVC transfer pipeline that connects the tank trailer unloading area to the container fill room is approximately 200 feet long and has three drain valves in the line to allow drainage of residues. After each use the line is flushed with water to prevent cross contamination of materials. Our investigation of this incident has determined that due to weather conditions the water flushed through the line after the prior use froze in the drain valves.

Josh gave me the tracking # and I found it was loaded in an AKE ULD on FedEx flight 1413 MEM - HNL. At the time ofthe discovery the flight was four hours out from HNL. Along with FedEx Flight Safety & Global Operations Control we decided to let the aircraft continue to the destination while advising the crew. That decision was based on the fact that since the aerosols were a non-flammable gas and could be loaded inaccessible to the crew, it made no sense to land at an airport that wasn't on the flight plan. The flight landed without incident and the shipment was recovered from the ULD. The FAA was notified, I spoke to SA Mike Givens in LAX.

Driver was delivering fuel to a client location. Upon arriving the driver had the client sign off on a product integrity form. The form stated that 7005 gallons of ULSD was to be delivered to the above ground 10000 gallon tank. Once the driver had done this he began to unload. As the driver finished unloading he began to walk his hose to ensure that the remaining fuel in the hose was out, fuel began to leak out of the tank vent. Driver immediately stopped draining the hose but approximately 20-30 gallons had leaked in to the concrete area around the tank. No product reached soil or drains. The customer and driver used saw dust to absorb the spill.

During the course of transportation, the shipment was stored in-transit at Clean Harbors' service center located in West Sacramento, CA.  During the course of this temporary storage, it was discovered that the 4 container developed a minor release whereby approximatley 1 liter in total escaped from the package onto the floor of the van trailer.  Facility personnel, using suitable protective equipment inspected the containers and determined that a small amount of residual water separated from the solid material and escaped through a pinhole leak in the liner of the IBC.  A suitable absorbent material was added to the containers to absorb all freee liquids and the clear liquid that was relesed was observed and placed into a suitable container and was sent for disposal along with the original containers.  The containers were observed and was determined that the leak had been stopped and contained.  Once secured, the containers were sent to the intended waste management facility for disposal.","At the time the container were accepted for transportation, no evidence of residula liquids was observed and the containers appeared to be intact and non-leaking.  The shipper of the material was contacted and it is believed that the material in question was removed from the filter press and immediatley containerized rather than allowing a suitable amount of time to completely dry out.  During the course of transportation, it is believed that residual liquid believed to be water separated from the solid material and leaked from the package.  In order to prevent a recurrence, the shipper will insure that the material, once removed from the filter press, is affored enough time to dry before containerizing and sending for disposal.

The vehicle was moved to a secured location  and a containmnet device was plced udner the valve to collect any material that escaped from the valve.  A maintenance crew was dispatched to the scene and it was discovered that a loose bolt, not evident at the time the driver departed for the trip allowed a small amount of product to drip from the rear valve.  The service technician tightented all bolts and the leak was stopped.  The truck was followed to the destination facility where the contents were unloaded.  After the vehicle was off-loaded, the trailer was placed out of service pending an inspection of the rear valve assembly.  Upon inspection, it was determined that the components of the valve did not fail but rather a bolt of the flange became loose due to what is believed to be vibration of the value during loading.  The valve was re-assembled and all bolts tightened according to all required specifications.  Due to the minimal amount actually released, there was no clean-up required.","AT the time of loaidng, the driver inspected the vehicle and no evidence of leakage was observed.  In order to prevent a recurence, the driver has been re-instructed to insure that a proper pre-trip inesection is performed and any deficiency noted and addressed prior to departure.  IN addition, the driver has been reminded to take all appropriate measures should an issue be discovered during routine load inspections while in transit.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

MAT.,800 NORTH LINDBERGH BLVD,SAINT LOUIS,MO,63167,Other-HAZMAT MANAGER,"Two (2) 55-gallon drums of an acidic liquid were shipped by a common carrier from our Luling, LA plantto our laboratories in St. Louis, MO. When the dock personnel moved the pallet in the truck, they noticed that the drums had leaked while in transport. The tops of the drums and an approximate 10X6 foot section of the trailer floor were wet (estimated spill 500-1000 ml).The dock personnel notified our site security office who notified our site safety group. The site safety responders tightened the bungs on the drums. They then used sodium bicarbonate to neutralize the liquid on the drums and the truck bed. All materials were swept up, cleaned and appropriately disposed.When the floor bed was dry, the carrier left the site and the drums were delivered to the intended recipient on the site.Upon investigation, it was determined that while the closure instructions for the drums were available and followed, the torque setting on the wrench was set incorrectly (9 Ibs/ft versus 20 Ibs/ft in the instructions).",We will institute a check list with a check off boxes to verify compliance. A second person will be responsible for reviewing the closure procedures and the torque wrench settings. We will add a tamper-proof seal to bung openingsand verify the filling of the drums to ensure the proper fill levels (outage and ullage).

Trailer was secured, a Material Safety Data Sheet was referenced, and SET Environmental, Inc. of Bridgeview, Illinois was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, SET Environmental, Inc. discovered one (1) steel tote, had a faulty weld on the drainage valve, which resulted in the release.  Approximately 5 gallons of free product were released to the trailer floor, and a minimal amount affected the gravel surface beneath the trailer.  SET Environmental, Inc. proceeded to apply oil dry to the free product, which was containerized into one (1) 55-gallon drum, along with the cleanup materials, pending disposal.  SET Environmental, Inc. proceeded to pump the remaining product from the damaged tote, into a compatible replacement tote, and one (1) 55-gallon recovery drum.  Two (2) 55-gallon recovery drums will be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  The compatible tote was sent along with the remainder of the shipment for disposition.

Forty minutes into unloading the driver went on top of the trailer to check all connections and gauges when the product hose from the rear of the trailer came apart at the bands of the hose.  The driver utilized the emergency shut off valve to stop the acid from spraying.  All acid was contained in the customer’s containment area.

Once the cause of the spill was determined the repair shop was contacted.  Presently all hoses that are used in our acid applicaiton are banded in two spots to connect the hose to the fitting.

BNSF contract responders after inspecting SCMX 4324 reported product seepage was observed between the tank car's belly flange and the BOV mounting flange with no other securement exceptions noted. It was suspected that the gasket seal failed.  A vacuum truck pulled the vacuum from SCMX 4324 and the product drips subsided. SCMX 4324 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard with a containment pool placed under SCMX 4324. On 2/21/08 by 1600 hrs. CST, all the remaining contents of SCMX 4324 was transferred into tanker trucks without further incident. No measurable product heel was observed afterwards, but a bag of oil dry was poured into SCMX 4324 to ensure the interior of SCMX 4324 was liquid free. All used absorbent pads and a small amount of liquid product collected from the containment pool were placed into a 55 gallon recovery drum for appropriate disposal. SCMX 4324 was forwarded to a qualified tank car repair facility to determine root cause of this leak.

Mr. Cooper advised no waterways were effected, there were no exposures involved, and digging was not required. Mr. Cooper stated Transloading Environmental would remediate the concrete as well as around the outside the container and within the container. A single floor- loaded 275 gallon IBC tote had been punctured and damaged from a tote being placed on top of it. the top tote shifted in transit. The resulting puncture released an estimated 3 gallons of product. A second floor-loaded tote was also damaged from a tote being placed on top if it, however it did not leak. There was no bi-level separation between the floor loaded totes and the two top loaded second tier totes. The top tier totes slipped from their stacking configuration, damaging the cage on the bottom tier totes, resulting in impact and damage to the poly totes. The damaged tote product was transfered into a new tote and placed back into the original container with the remaining lading. The leaking tote product was transfered into a new tote, and is awaiting disposal per the shipper.
