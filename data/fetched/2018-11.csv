OUR DRIVER LEFT A STOP AT 201 SPRING ST. AND WAS ON ROUTE TO NEXT STOP. APPROXIMATELY 200 YARDS FROM 201 THE TRUCK STARTED TO LEAVE THE ROAD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. THE TRUCK TRAVELED 150' WITH THE PASSENGER SIDE TIRES IN THE MUD ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WHEN THE TRUCK FINALLY GOT BACK ON THE PAVEMENT THE TRUCK SHOT ACROSS THE ROAD STRUCK A TREE AND SPUN AROUND SO THAT NOSE OF THE VEHICLE WAS HEADING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM IT'S PREVIOUS TRAVEL DIRECTION. THE TRUCK LANDED ON IT'S PASSENGER SIDE.  THE CAB WAS DEMOLISHED, THE PROPANE TANK WAS DENTED, BUT NOT COMPROMISED. THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT WITH THE GROUND SNAPPED THE BACK CHECK VALVE IN HALF WHERE IT ENTERED THE TANK. EVEN THOUGH THE EXTERIOR PORTION OF THE VALVE WAS DAMAGED THE BACK CHECK PERFORMED IT'S INTENDED JOB OF CONTROLLING THE AMOUNT OF LEAKAGE, THE VALVE HAS A SMALL HOLE (#56 DRILL SIZE) TO ALLOW PRESSURE TO EQUALIZE BETWEEN PORTIONS OF THE PIPING. PROPANE IS ALSO A REFRIGERANT, SO THERE WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF FROST OF FROST AT THE POINT OF THE LEAK MAKING AN ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS OF THE DAMAGE DIFFICULT. BECAUSE OF THIS WE COULD NOT TELL THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO THE PIPING.  THE DECISION WAS MADE TO TAKE THE SAFEST REMEDIATION WHICH WAS TO TOTALLY EVACUATE THE CONTENTS OF THE TRUCK. WE WERE ABLE TO PUMP APPROXIMATELY 600 GALLONS INTO ANOTHER TRUCK, AND THE REST OF THE LOAD WAS BURNED OFF. THE TANK WA SPURGE WITH WATER BEFORE RIGHTING THE TRUCK. THIS PROCESS WAS THE SAFEST BUT ALSO THE LONGEST IN TIME, ACCOUNTING FOR THE LENGTH OF THE INCIDENT.","WE WILL BE INCREASING OUR TRAINING FOR DRIVERS IN THIS AREA.

The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Mr. Albert Daniel, phone 919-291-4832. Contractor personnel secured all valves and secondary closure. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move. 7.1 will be completed against Midland Manufacturing for this particular valve model.

Prior to transport, free liquid was observed in one of the drums and a decision was made to solidify. Solidification at that time was accomplished with absorbent clay. Upon delivery, more free liquid was observed in the same drum. Solidification was again attempted. This time corn cob material was mistakenly used. The organic material reacted with the acid starting a fire in the drum. Personnel were immediately removed from the area and emergency services called. Upon arrival a single drum was found to be burning. This drum had been placed over secondary containment prior to the solidification effort. Emergency service personnel opted to allow the drum to self extinguish. Once cleared, Field Service personnel re-entered the building in proper PPE and supplied air. The remainder of the involved drum and material was repackaged into appropriate containers and set out for a 72 hour fire watch to ensure no re-ignition.

BNSF Hazmat responders inspected the car and found no evidence of leakage from the car.  On 11/10/18, the UP again reported that the car had a slight odor from the BOV threads on the car.  BNSF Hazmat and Dow Chemical responders responded and found the BOV threads to be intermittently releasing a small amount of vapor from the threads at the nozzle to the BOV Cap assembly.  Responders removed the cap to inspect.  The valve was intact and not leaking by, the threads were very dirty/greasy but the gasket was in good condition and in place.  The threads were cleaned and the cap assembly was re secured to the nozzle with a 36"" pipe wrench.  All released vapor dissipated to atmosphere.  No environmental impacts were noted.",Shipper should review maintenance procedures for this component on the cars.

SUNPRO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a release of lading from the liquid eduction line at the flanged connection below the valve due to a pinched gasket. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Mr. Ralph Mikida, phone 267-422-2405. Contractor personnel covered the external valve with polypropylene sheeting and removed all spilled material from the car. The valve will require repair from an AAR approved Mobile Repair Unit; to replace the damaged gasket and requalification. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

The leak was identified by white whispy fumes coming form near the base of a group of drums.  Upon further investigation, the employee moved the drum and found a small amount of material on the floor of the trailer.  Tipping the drum on its side showed that the source of the material on the trailer floor and the white whisps was a small hole on the bottom of the drum.  The employee evacuated the immediate area and notified his immediate supervisor.  Representatives of the Veolia Safety Department and Reactive Chemicals Group responded to a call for assistance from the supervisor.  A review of a the packing slip summary indicated that the contents of the drum was metal chloride clean up debris.  Given the small amount of material released (<25 mL debris, <5 mL metal chloride), the favorable conditions present at  the spill location (well-ventilated), and the employee expertise on hand, the following steps were used to manage the  incident safely, quickly, and efficiently: additional PPE was donned, a salvage drum was secured, absorbent material  was applied to all effected areas and to the bottom of the salvage container, the leaking drum was double-bagged and  placed into the salvage container, the spill clean-up debris (<5 lbs) was added to the salvage drum, and the salvage drum  was closed per manufacturer's specifications/closure instructions. In total, the response activities lasted <45 minutes.  To ensure safe and expedited transportation and material management, the transporter (Veolia driver) was fully informed  of the situation (minimal hazard and risk post-response), the drum was immediately transported to the disposal facility  (with intentional placement at the back end to the trailer, and the disposal facility was fully notified of the situation to  ensure safe and expedited management upon receipt.","Post-incident, an Incident Investigation and a Root Cause Analysis were conducted and yielded the  following actions item: contact a generator representative to discuss the incident causes & and  preventative measures to prevent recurrence.

The Package Handler immediately notified trained hazmat personnel who donned PPE, placed the hazmat into an approved hazmat salvage bag, and removed the hazmat to an isolated area. The trained personnel then performed an inspection on the package. The inspection concluded that the bottom corner on the body of the plastic jerry can had been punctured or abraded to the point of allowing the contents to leak out. Once the inspection was concluded the package was placed into an approved hazmat salvage drum and quarantined away from untrained persons. Station is now awaiting disposition from PGH.

The top on one of the IBC's poped open and approx 150 lbs of material leaked out. The other IBC appeared to be okay, but some small leakage may have come from the bottom of IBC. As soon as this happend our driver reported to local dispatcher and he then called ABF safety and security ho tline to report. Haz mat clean up team was contracted to clean up. Exposed material was contained in 55 gallon drum and the IBC's were loaded back on ABF trailer and taken back to local service center. Waiting on disposition of disposal of contaiminated material and sent the 2 IBC's to consignee on 11/21 so they can inspect.","In future loader/checker of any haz material should secure actual shipment independently and not rely on other freight to block and brace. A load bar was utilized in front of IBC's and then another load bar was used behind them, but with two other shipments in-between. I would also note that on the bottom feet of IBC's a (plastic-nylon type foot) applies to each of the 4 legs, this makes the IBC's slide easily and with any type incline would allow them to move fairly easy.

It was reported that the customer refused the freight. At 2035 ET, Environmental Works (EW) personnel arrived on site at the customer's location and confirmed there were (2) 55-gallon steel drums of the HAP 30 White material still on the trailer but only one was damaged. The damaged drum was dented towards the bottom and released an estimated 1/2 a cup of material to the trailer floor. EW placed granular absorbents on the area to get it cleaned. The second drum has some type of material at the bottom weld of the drum and was also rejected by the customer. Due to the integrity of both containers being questionable, ERTS instructed EW to overpack both containers and place the original labels back on the truck.

The customer has a 275 gallon basement tank, the driver was outside filling the tank while listening for air. When he felt that it was filled more than he thought was correct, he stopped to check the meter, it noted 281.5 gallons. The driver then alerted the customer and they went inside the customers home to check the tank in the basement and it had overfilled. The tank gauge and cap were off and were sitting on top of the tank, which is why the air could not be heard while it was being filled. Lykins was immediately contacted by the driver and made aware of the spill. The Director of Safety, Environmental, and Maintenance contacted the National Response Center (NRC# 1231407), The Kentucky EPA (EPA#20186233), and Environmental Management Specialists, Inc. on 11/27/2018 and met their representatives at the spill location. They assessed the spill and any property damage and environmental concerns then concluded that the family was to stay in a hotel while the basement was cleaned up. The basement is being remodeled, everything that was damaged has been removed and will be replaced. The basement remodeling is ongoing.","In our spring safety meetings we will be emphasizing the importance of taking your time and being overly cautious when filling tanks. We want to make sure that the drivers know they can always stop the flow,check the meter, and then continue the flow again if they are unsure of how full the tank is.

VEOLIA NORTH AMERICA, GERMANTOWN, WI WAS CONTRACTED TO DO THE REMEDIATION AT THE SCENE.  VEOLIA DISCOVERED THAT A RATCHET OR BUCKLE FROM A STRAP HAD BROKEN OFF ONE OF THE RAILS FROM THE WALL WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT PUNCTURED THE TOP SIDE CORNER OF THE WHITE PLASTIC BOTTLE OF THE IBC. THE PUNCTURE RESULTED IN A HALF DOLLAR SIZE OPENING IN THE PLASTIC WALL OF THE IBC.  THE DRIVER HAD PUT FOUR IBC'S INSIDE OF THE VERY BACK OF THE TRAILER. HE PLACED ONE STRAP BEHIND THE IBC'S (WALL TO WALL), AND ANOTHER STRAP IN FRONT OF THE FOUR IBC'S, ALSO WALL TO WALL. WE BELIEVE THE FRONT STRAP BROKE LOOSE WITH A LOT FORCE, HITTING THE CORNER OF THE IBC, RIPPING RIGHT THROUGH THE PLASTIC.  VEOLIA APPLIED HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF ABSORBENTS TO THE INSIDE OF THE TRAILER AND THEN TRANSFERRED ALL THE CORROSIVE LIQUID FROM THE PUNCTURED IBC TO A NEW EMPTY IBC. THE ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE REMEDIATION FROM VEOLIA WAS APPROXIMATELY 9:45 P.M. TO 11:35 P.M., JUST UNDER TWO HOURS.","WE BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF THIS IBC PUNCTURE WAS THE RESULT OF THE DRIVER FAILING TO APPLY STRAPS TO THE IBC'S PROPERLY. OUR INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT HAD THE DRIVER STRAPPED TWO EACH OF THESE FOUR IBCS SECURELY TO EACH SIDEWALL, THIS EVENT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED. STRAPPING THE FOUR TOTES WITH ONE STRAP IN FRONT AND ONE IN BACK CREATED TO MUCH SLACK, WHICH IN TURN PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE RATCHETS AND RAIL CLIPS. ADDITIONAL TRAINING INFORMATION ON PROPER IBC SECUREMENT HAS AND IS BEING FORWARDED TO BOTH OUR DOCK PERSONNEL AND OUR DRIVERS THROUGH A VISUAL PRESENTATION IN OUR DRIVERS ROOM TELEVISION DISPLAY AND THROUGH OUR THREE COMPANY DRIVER TRAINERS.",No,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10900,N+M TRANSFER CO.,US,

THE 2 WITHDRAWAL HOSES THAT TRANSFER THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FROM THE NURSE TANK TO THE ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BAR EACH GO INTO THEIR OWN SAFETY QUICK RELEASE COUPLER.

Lone Star HazMat Response (Lone Star) responded and used sand to contain the flow of the hot liquid asphalt (tar) and to recover it as it cooled. The train tracks were scraped with a skid steer so that rail traffic could continue. The locomotive and commuter railcars were removed by another engine to an alternate track and Lone Star placed thick plastic sheeting around all ends to contain any possible tar runoff. Sand was mixed into the cooling tar and collected into a roll-off container. Tar on the ground was excavated into three additional roll-off containers for disposal.  Lone Star returned to the site on November 26, 2018 to perform two separate activities: A) begin completion of recovering all tar from the impact site; and B) clean tar from the railcar which was directly behind the locomotive. (NOTE: The locomotive was scheduled to be transported to Canada for repairs, which is estimated to take several more months; therefore, the locomotive damages are under a separate claim). November 26, 2018:   A) Lone Star excavated the tar-contaminated gravel below the railroad tracks (ballast) and loaded it into a dump truck for disposal. A specialty non-hazardous, tar­removing chemical compound (Bess Solution) was delivered.in a 375-gallon tote and sprayed on the sides of the railroad tracks. A heated pressure washer with surfactant was then used to clean the tracks. The tar-contaminated ballast and contaminated soil from this process was excavated into one roll-off container for disposal. · B) The railcar was moved to a TRE train shop. Lone Star placed plastic underneath · and around the railcar to contain the runoff from the cleaning process. Lone Star personnel used safety harnesses and cables while on a scissor lift for the cleaning of this double-decker commuter railcar. Bess Solution was applied to the railcar and a heated pressure washer with surfactant was used to clean the railcar. The runoff from this process was channeled to a shop drain, which leads to an isolated, underground oil/water separator. This process continued on November 27, 28, 29, 30, 2018, and December 3,4,5, and 7, 2018.  November 27 and 28, 2018:  A) Lone Star excavated contaminated ballast underneath the railroad tracks with hand tools, to prevent potential damage of the tracks by heavy equipment. Ballast removed from below the tracks was then placed into two dump trucks by an excavator. Twenty-Four (24) cubic yards of new ballast was used to replace the excavated ballast.  November 29, 2018:   A) Lone Star used a heated pressure washer with a surfactant to clean the metal barriers and crossing arms on both sides of the track.
