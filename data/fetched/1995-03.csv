TWENTY NINE CARS OF 90 CAR TRAIN DERAILED (9TH THROUGH 27TH CARS AND 42ND THROUGH 51ST CARS) DUE TO LESS THAN REQUIRED INNER COIL SPRINGS ON CAR BM5270 AT THE BL LOCATION ON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE, EXAGGERATED BY A WHEEL FLANGE HEIGHT DIFFERENTIAL ON THE L1 91-31/64) AND THE L2 (1-16/64) WHEEL COMBINED WITH A SUSPECTED DEVIATION IN CROSS-ELEVATION. WITHIN FRA SPECIFICATIONS, CAUSING THE L2 WHEEL TO LIFT AND SPREAD RAIL.  OF THE 29 CARS DERAILED, ONE HAZMAT, CAR CGLX 690, SODIUM CHLORATE, WAS DELIVERED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE TRACKS PARTIALLY SUBMERGED IN A SMALL INLET OF WATER. SHIPPER/MANUFACTURER EKA NOBEL ADVISED RAILROAD NOT TO OPEN THE SODIUM CHLORATE CAR DUE TO THE SPILLED LUMBER AROUND CAR.  TESTING OF WATERS AROUND CAR AND IN LAKE CHAMPLAIN WAS BEGUN BY ADIRONDACK TESTING LABS (FOR DELAWARE AND HUDSON) AND C.T. MALE ENGINEER (FOR NEW YORK STATE DEPT. OF CONSERVATION).  ALL TESTS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE - NO PRODUCT DETECTED IN WATERS.  MARCH 5, 1995- UNDERWATER VIDEO DEPLOYED TO SEARCH FOR DAMAGE TO CAR AND PRODUCT IN WATERS.  NO OPENINGS DISCOVERED OR VISIBLE PRODUCT. MARCH 10, 1995- ALL LUMBER WAS REMOVED FROM AROUND THE SODIUM CHLORATE CAR.  MARCH 15, 1995 - HATCHES WERE OPENED ON CAR REVEALING THAT SUBMERGED COMPARTMENT HAD FILLED WITH WATER TO THE LEVEL OF THE POND AND WATER HAD FROZEN.  TESTS WERE TAKEN OF LAGOON, AREA AROUND CAR, LAKE AND IN THE SUBMERGED COMPARTMENT.  RESULTS OF TESTING INDICATED NO PRODUCT DETECTED IN ANY OF THESE AREAS. THE TOP COMPARTMENT OF CAR WAS FOUND TO BE INTACT, STABLE AND DRY.  THE PRODUCT IN THIS COMPARTMENT WAS NOT IN DANGER OF RELEASING.  MARCH 17, 1995- UNDERWATER INSPECTION REVEALED A LARGE RIP IN END OF CAR.  VISIBILITY AND DEBRIS FROM DERAILMENT DID NOT ALLOW FOR A THROUGH INSPECTION OF AREA.  AREA WAS NOT PREVIOUSY INSPECTED DUE TO LUMBER LYING AGAINST CAR.  NO PRODUCT WAS VISIBLE BELOW CAR OR AROUND HOLE.  LOW AREA OF LAGOON WAS ALSO INSPECTED AND NO PRODUCT NOTED.  TESTS WERE AGAIN PERFORMED BY ADIRONDACK TESTING LABS AND RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE. AGAIN, NYS DEC WAS PRESENT FOR ALL TESTING AND INSPECTIONS.  TWO TANK TRUCKS WERE SUPPLIED BY WEST CENTRAL ENVIRONMENTAL TO TRANSLOAD SODIUM CHLORATE IN UPPER COMPARTMENT OF CAR.  LIQUIDIFIED AND PUMPED APPROXIMATELY 50% OF SODIUM CHLORATE IN UPPER COMPARTMENT FILING ON E OF THE TWO TANK TRUCKS.  DURING INITIAL PUMPING PROCESS A HOLE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE ""B"" END OF CAR.  HOE WAS 6"" IN DIAMETER AND WAS PREVIOUSLY OBSCURED BY THE SODIUM CHLORATE FROM THE INSIDE AND BY THE RAILWAY EMBANKMENT ON THE OUTSIDE.  PUMPED PRODUCT TO A LEVEL BELOW THIS HOLE AND RETAINED THE LIQUIDIFIED SODIUM CHLORATE BELOW THIS HOLE.  NYS DEC, US EPA AND NYS DOT WERE PRESENT AND MADE AWARE OF THIS BREACH.

ON MARCH 31, 1995 AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 A TRAILER CONTAINING THE AFOREMENTIONED HAZARDOUS MATERIAL WAS GOING THROUGH OUR SAFETY LANE FOR INSPECTION AT OUR HENDERSON COLORADO TERMINAL FACILITY FOR A ROUTINE INSPECTION WHEN A LOOSE PLACARD HOLDER WAS DETECTED.  UPON DISCOVERY OF THE LOOSE PLACARD HOLDER THE TRAILER WAS ROUTED INTO THE SHIP IN ORDER TO HAVE THE PLACARD SECURED TO THE TRAILER WITH A RIVET.  A MECHANIC WAS IN THE PROCESS OF DRILLING A HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE TRAILER WHEN HE DRILLED INTO THE SIDE TOO FAR PUNCTURING A THIRTY (30) GALLON DRUM CONTAINING CORROSIVE LIQUIDS, N.O.S. (POTASSIUM HYDOXIDE, SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE), 8, UN1760, PG 11.  AFTER IT WAS DISCOVERED THE DRUM HAD BEEN PUNCTURED, THE TRAILER WAS MOVED TO A REMOTE AREA OF THE TERMINAL FACILITY WHERE IT WAS SECURED AND THE SPILLED MATERIAL WAS CONTAINED.  A SPILL RESPONSE FIRM WAS IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED IN ORDER TO CLEAN UP THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL.  THE L.E.P.C. AND FIRE DEPARTMENT WERE ALSO NOTIFIED OF THE SPILL, HOWEVER, DID NOT RESPOND TO THE SCENE SINCE THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL WAS CONTAINED.  THE SPILL RESPONSE FIRM (WEST HAZ MAT) ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND OPENED THE TRAILER DOORS AND WENT IN TO INVESTIGATE.  THEY LOCATED THE PUNCTURED DRUM AND PLACED IT INTO AN OVERPACK.  THE MATERIAL THAT HAD SPILLED ONTO THE GROUND WAS SCRAPED UP AND PLACED IN A DRUM FOR DISPOSAL.  THE REMAINDER OF THE FREIGHT WAS UNLOADED AND CLEANED OFF.  THE TRAILER WAS WASHED OUT AND THE MATERIAL WAS RE-LOADED.  THE MECHANIC WHO HAD DRILLED THE HOLE IN THE TRAILER WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL, DUE TO SOME OF THE MATERIAL THAT HAD LEAKED ONTO HIS HAND.  THE MECHANICS HAND WAS CHECKED AND HE WAS RELEASED BY THE DOCTOR TO RETURN TO WORK.  SINCE THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED, A DECISION HAS BEEN MADE THAT A TRAILER CONTAINING HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CANNOT BE WORKED ON WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FROM A SHOP SUPERVISOR.  EXTRA PRECAUTIONS WILL BE TAKEN WITH ANY TRAILER CONTAINING HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CANNOT BE WORKED ON WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FROM A SHOP SUPERVISOR.  EXTRA PRECAUTIONS WILL BE TAKEN WITH ANY TRAILER CONTAINING HAZARDOUS MATERIAL.  ALL OF OUR EQUIPMENT IS MAINTAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS AND IS NOT UTILIZED UNTIL IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED.

ON HWY 29-32 WEST, JUST AFTER EXITING HWY 41 NORTH, THE DRIVER WAS CUT OFF IN TRAFFIC AND HAD TO BRAKE HARD TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT.  THE RESULT OF THIS ACTION WAS THE SHIFTING OF FREIGHT INSIDE THE TRAILER.  THREE OF FOUR TOTE CONTAINERS, SEPARATED FROM THEIR SKIDS CAUSING ONE OF THE TOTES TO RUPTURE.  THE DRIVER WAS FLAGGED DOWN BY A PASSING MOTORIST.  HE STOPPED HIS VEHICLE IN AN AREA AWAY FROM MAJOR TRAFFIC AND DWELLINGS, ABOUT 1 1/2 MILES AWAY. LOCAL D.N.R. OFFICIAL AND A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CLEAN UP CREW WERE CALLED WITH TO THE SCENE.  THE SPILL WAS PRIMARILY CONTAINED TO THE TRAILER WITH SOME MATERIAL LEAKING TO THE GROUND THROUGH THE TRAILER FLOOR BOARDS. THIS MATERIAL WAS CONTAINED TO A SMALL AREA BY BUILDING UP DIRT AROUND THAT AREA.  THE MATERIAL IN THE TRAILER WAS COLLECTED AND PUT INTO 55 GALLON DRUMS FOR DISPOSAL.  WHEN THE CLEAN UP AT THE SCENE WAS FINISHED, THE TRAILER WAS TAKEN TO KRUEGER INTERNATIONALS GREEN BAY PLANT FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL THE FUMES FROM THE SPILL DISSIPATED AND A CREW COULD ENTER THE TRAILER AND SECURE THE REMAINING FULL TOTES.  THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON MARCH 17TH.  THE TRAILER WAS BROUGHT BACK TO WEST BEND WHERE THE REMAINING MATERIAL WAS CLEANED OUT.  THEN THE REMAINING GOOD  MATERIAL WAS RETURNED TO THE COOK COMPOSITES & POLYMERS SAUKVILLE PLANT ON MARCH 20TH FOR SALVAGE.  OUR INVESTIGATION AS TO WHY THE LOAD SHIFTED PROVED TO BE IMPROPER LOADING AND SECURING OF FREIGHT.  THE TOTES WERE ONLY SECURED AT THE REAR AND SINCE THE TOTES WERE NOT IN THE NOSE OF TRAILER, THE MATERIAL IN FRONT OF TOTES WAS NOT ABLE TO PREVENT THE TOTES FROM SHIFTING OFF OF THEIR SKIDS WHEN THE DRIVER HAD TO BRAKE HARD.
