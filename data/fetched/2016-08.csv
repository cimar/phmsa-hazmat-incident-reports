HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a leak from the base of the liquid line valve. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Geocycle-AR George Colvin, 662-549-2860. Contractor personnel removed the valve and placed a cap/plug and decontaminated the car treated the ballast impacted by the spilled material. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did require a special switching move. 7.1 required? yes     Cause Code: 282. Threaded valve was tool-tight but just barely.

A PROPER SCALE CHECK HEIGHT/WEIGHT TEST WAS PERFORMED THE MORNING IN WHICH THE CYLINDER WAS FILLED AND THERE WERE NO ISSUES WITH THE SCALE. THE CYLINDER PRIOR TO BEING FILLED WITH THE CURRENT TARE HEIGHT BEING 85 POUNDS VERSUS OF THE ORIGINAL TARE WEIGHT OF 86 POUNDS WHICH IS WELL WITHIN THE 5 TOLERANCE LEVEL. THE VALVE OF THE CYLINDER WAS ALSO INSPECTED AND TESTED PRIOR TO THE CONTAINER BEING FILLED WITH NO PROBLEMS NOTED.

Here is why.  Our driver (Donnie)went to the delivery area and met with the plant operator.  The operator indicated that he couldn't open the cap on the valve on the customer fill line.  Our driver looked at it and told the operator it should come open and he pulled on the valve.  The cap popped off in his hand and there was some pressure behind the cap which sprayed a mist out on the right side of his face, on his right hand, and abdomen.

The car was isolated and BNSF Hazmat responders were dispatched to inspect and mitigate the release.  BNSF responders assessed the cabinet and determined liquid to be leaking from the threaded cap on the liquid line.  The valves were inspected and found to be what appeared to be in the closed position but were noted to be frozen.  Responders were able to tighten the cap which stopped the visual and audible release from the car.  There were no environmental impacts as the argon vaporized and dissipated.  The LTCX 1919 was placed on an inspection track with a hold applied.  Praxair was contacted and requested for a car technician to inspect the car prior to further movement.  On 8/4/16, a Praxair Technician inspected the car, replaced the liquid line cap gasket and secured the car.  No defects with the valve were noted or observed by the technician.

During unloading Hub personnel also noticed this unit had a leaning condition, making it unsafe to move in its condition. In the interest of safety, this unit was placed on hold from OG and was placed on the ground pending interior inspection of the cargo. WB showed unit to be loaded with hazardous materials, for safety reasons United Pumping Services was called out to asses the spilled product and to test the leaking material to determine if it was hazardous or nonhazardous.    Interior inspection found unit to be loaded with a mix freight of shrinkwrapped palletized pales, case products and two large IBC totes, stowed two rows wide with a partial second layer. A rear bull board was applied as a form of rear door securement, however there were several lateral voids that did not have any form of securement and resulted in some of the cargo to shift towards the left sidewall and creating a leaning condition. The responder found the leak to have been coming from a damaged pallet loaded with 5 gallon pails of a concentrated chlorinated bleach, a class 8 hazardous material  UN1791. Approximately 10 gallons of product spilled due to one of the nails from the damaged pallet puncturing holes on two 5 gallon pails, with approximately 1 gallon of product spilling on the ground.     United Pumping Services was able to clean up the spilled product and remediate all of the affected areas, the cargo had to be adjusted and secured in order for this unit to be placed onto a chassis and moved away from the trackside where it was placed.

Upon arrival SPSI determined the point of release to be the top mounted liquid line ball valve - thread interface into the valve assembly plate was found less than hand tight, resulting in the release of hazardous materials. SPSI secured the release by proper application of the valve to tool-tightness, and removed all material on the exterior of the car.

SERVICES",7300 W. Bradley Road,Milwaukee,WI,53223,Carrier,"On August 17th, 2016, a Hydrite Chemical Co. delivery was made to Miller Electric on behalf of Americo Chemical Co., our customer.        Hydrite manufactures the bulk chemical for our customer, and delivers bulk products for them.    The order of Americo Spray Clean 1117B at Miller Electric was for 9,990 gallons, and in this case 1,085 gallons were made and loaded for delivery to Miller electric.   The actual batch size for this load is typically over the order quantity due to adjustments in manufacturing.   The actual batch size may vary.    Our driver, Jerry Golata, arrived at the Miller site, and was directed to dock 17.   Jerry hooked up compartment #2 to the unloading connection.   Tom H. from Miller Electric came out to the unloading area.   Jerry asked Tom to sign the Bill of Lading to verify the load and delivery.   Tom looked at the connection and signed the BOL.   (The pre/unload safety checks on the BOL stated 1. the product is what was ordered, 2. there is adequate capacity available in the storage tank, 3. the hoses are connected to the correct inlet, and 4. the valves are in the correct position.)  Jerry Golata then signed both copies of the BOL and put the customer copy of the signed BOL in a nearby plastic tube on the fence.      Tom told Jerry to grab a radio and ask for Tom if he needed anything and then he went into the building and did not return.   After a while, Jerry connected the air hose to the trailer and the pump on the tractor, opened the valves slowly and began the transfer.   After a while, Jerry went to the overhead door to see if he could check on the tank, but the overhead door was locked.   About 30 minutes later, the hose made a slight shake indicating it was empty, so Jerry closed the internal and then external valves.   He then closed the valve at the building and shut off the air to pump the trailer.   He bled the pressure off of the hose and disconnected the air from the trailer and tractor.   Then he released the pressure from compartment #2.   He capped off the hoses and put them away along with the bleeder bucket.    Jerry walked around the truck to inspect before he left.   He went to the northwest end of the lot to fill out the log book and customer information sheet and left around 8:00 AM.   At the time he left, Jerry was unaware that the storage tank had been overfilled and that material had leaked out of the vent and into the containment area.   It had also splattered on the overhead door.     Miller Electric found the release some time between 8:00 and 8:20 AM, and contacted Americo Chemical Products Co.    Americo contacted Hydrite sales (Jerry Colarassi), who contacted Ryan Griffin, Operations Manager at Hydrite Chemical Co., to notify him that the storage tank had overflowed.   The material was in containment and impacted an overhead door.    There were no injuries or releases to the environment.   Hydrite called in Northshore Environmental services to respond.   In the meantime, folks at Mille","Hydrite Chemical Co. lists both the order quantity and the actual quantity of a delivery on the BOL.    Many of the batches are made to order at our plant, and loaded directly into a tanker.   When possible, we contact the customer prior to shipment to verify if they can accept the full volume, but on off hours this may not be possible since the delivery and driver times may be when the customer is not operating.   In order to address this, we have pre/unload safety checks on the BOL that include customer check of adequate capacity available in the storage tank(s).    We have reviewed this overfill event with our drivers.   Our customers must have adequate capacity to receive our loads.   Although written on Bills of Lading, our drivers will now highlight to the customer when the delivered quantity exceeds the order quantity, and ask them to verify that they have adequate capacity to receive that amount before they sign the pre/unload safety check and we unload.  We often schedule a bit more than the order, since we may have transfer losses.   Recognize that each foot of hose can hold nearly 2 gallons, so these must be considered in scheduling.        We need customers to manage their storage tanks and know the available capacity.   Companies may have gauges, level meters, and some have controllers that can be used to prevent overfills.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8623,Hydrite Chemical Co.,US,

The shipper and our driver inspected the CTMV and did not find any product release.  Our driver departed for the consignee, stopping in Anna, Ohio for fuel.  At the fuel station, our driver noticed product fumes, and checked the CTMV, finding no release.  Our driver departed the fuel station, but thought he heard the pressure relief valve cycling.  He pulled over on the highway on-ramp to re-inspect the CTMV.  Our driver observed a release at the front bulkhead, placed a bucket under the CTMV to contain the hazmat, and called our 24/7 call center for assistance.  We dispatched a hazmat contractor.  Shortly after, the CTMV failed catastrophically.  The tank shell burst, releasing the contents to the on-ramp pavement and surrounding soil.  We called local and county fire and hazmat.    Local fire department crews and hazmat teams arrived, followed shortly by the hazmat contractor.  The incident commander mitigated the effects of the release by cordoning off the area, which included closing the on-ramp.  Subsequently, the impacted pavement was cleaned, and the impacted soils were removed.  Damages are not available at this time.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation.  A labpack drum containing one pint glass bottle of solution fell 1' from storage pallet onto warehouse floor into containment.  Inner glass bottle leaked.  The 5 gallon labpack drum also leaked from its lid while drum was on its side.  Approximately 3 ounces of material leaked onto floor.  Drum was immediately up-righted.  Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised container into a suitable salvage drum. Spilled material was cleaned with absorbent.  Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed. Drivers will continue to inspect each container during staging period as well as before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity. IN addition, the shipper has been advised of the situation and have been asked to inspect all container used for the transport of waste materials to insure they meet all required  specifications.  It is suggested the officer should provide its staff with additional training on the correct preparation of labpacks for transportation.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc",US,

Reportedly, there was product around the top and noticeable on the side of the tank car.. The tank car was located within the classification yard tracks and was isolated. The shipper, Reagent Chemicals, was notified via Chemtrec, report #2016-0824-00169. Environmental Management Specialists, a CSXT emergency response contractor and a CSX Hazardous Material Manager, was dispatched to the Queensgate Terminal. It was suspected due to a deteriorated portion of the tank car and evidence of acid in that location that there was a possible breach in the vapor space of the tank car just below the pressure housing flange where the weld attaches to the tank car. The shipper representative, KEVIN CALLAIS, was notified of the situation found and preparation was made for a possible transfer of the product. A temporary patch was put over the suspected area with a sealant caulk in order to safely move to an accessible location within the Terminal. During movement and after the tank car was placed in an accessible area it was checked and no visible product was found nor any hydrochloric vapors were evident. The entire flange assembly was wrapped in a plastic sheet to secure the area from impending rain.    Environmental Management Specialists, CSXT Hazmat Manager and a Reagent Chemical employee returned to the yard on August 25, 2016 to further inspect the tank car and determine if the tank shell was leaking. After further inspection hydrochloric acid was visible inside of the plastic sheeting which showed there was an issue with a component on the housing of the tank car. It was determined that the fill hole was improperly secured and that was the point of release. The fill hole was properly secured for transportation and the tank car was neutralized to remove any residue hydrochloric acid. The tank car was then released for transportation.  .

BNSF Hazmat Manager responded to the car and upon arrival found an active release in the form of vapor slightly hissing from the pressure relief valve.  Further examination and disassembly of the pressure relief valve revealed an improperly sized O-ring on the stem side of the movable valve.  The O-ring was replaced with the proper fitting O-ring and the car was monitored for any evidence of release.  Pressure was at 165 psi and held with no further release.  The following day, BNSF contractor United Pumping measured pressure, outage, and monitored for any evidence of release via use of CGI to detect LEL - no evidence of further release was found.  No remediation necessary, FRA Steven Wolfe was contacted for advice on movement of this car and whether or not OTMA would be required.  Wolfe replied indicating OTMA would not be needed if bubble leak test was performed.  Bubble leak test was performed by Union Tank Car on 9/13/2016 and car was released from hold status for furtherance and delivery.","Shipper was notified of the incident.  Cars used in transportation of hazardous materials shipment must be properly equipped and have functioning valves, fittings, closures, and seals to prevent release.

OUR CURRENT PROGRAM CONSISTS OF TRAINING REGULAR SAFETY MEETINGS, SAFETY AWARDS AND OTHER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF VEHICLE ACCIDENTS. WE WILL CONTINUE THOSE EFFORTS IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, DUE IN PART TO THE SEVERITY OF THIS INCIDENT, WE HAD A SPECIAL SAFETY MEETING FOLLOWING THIS ACCIDENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFOCUSING OUR DRIVERS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ATTENTIVE AND SAFE DRIVING. WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR NEW AND BETTER WAYS TO INSTILL THE VALUE OF SAFE DRIVING IN ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES WHO OPERATE OUR VEHICLES, PARTICULARLY OUR LARGER TRUCKS.     THE DRIVER OF THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE WAS ONE OF OUR MOST EXPERIENCED DRIVERS AND HAD BEEN THROUGH A THOROUGH TRAINING PROCESS TO ASSUMING HIS DUTIES AS A TRANSPORT DRIVER. HIS DRIVING RECORD WAS EXCELLENT AND HIS JOB PERFORMANCE PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT HAD BEEN VERY SATISFACTORY. FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, WE REASSIGNED HIM TO ANOTHER POSITION IN THE COMPANY WHERE HE IS NO LONGER DRIVING LARGE VEHICLES.

THOMAS STEEL STRIP CORPORATION (TSSC) HAD A RELEASE OF 880 POUNDS (LBS) OF FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION (REPORTABLE QUANITY [RQ] = 100 LBS) ONTO GRAVEL. THIS RELEASE WAS IMMEDIATELY REPORTED BY TELEPHONE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (CASE # 1157580) AT 9:24AM. AND THE OHIO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (OHIO EPA) (ID # 1608-78-1747) AT 9:29AM. ALTHOUGH AN RQ OF FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION DID NOT LEAVE TSSC’S PROPERTY BOUNDARY, THIS CORRESPONDENCE SERVES TSSC’S WRITTEN FOLLOW-UP NOTIFICATION OF THE REPORTABLE SPILL EVENT.     TSSC IS LOCATED ON DELAWARE AVENUE N.W., IN WARREN TOWNSHIP, TRUMBULL COUNTY. THOMAS PROCESSING COMPANY (TPC), PART OF TSSC, OPERATES A HYDROCHLORIC ACID PICKLING LINE FOR TSSC’S STEEL STRIP THAT IS PROCESSED FURTHER THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY. A BYPRODUCT OF THE PICKING PROCESS IS FERROUS CHLORIDE (CAS # 7758-94-3) SOLUTION. TYPICALLY, TPC USES ON-SITE REGENERATED FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION IN THE HYDROCHLORIC ACID PICKLING LINE SO THE FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION IS NOT TRANSPORTED OFFSITE. HOWEVER, THE ON-SITE FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION REGENERATION PLANT WAS DOWN FOR REPAIRS, AND ON AUGUST 29, 2016 THE FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION WAS BEING SHIPPED VIA TANKER TRUCK FOR RECLAMATION TO AMROX IN ALLENPORT, PENNSLYVANIA (SEE THE ENCLOSED BILL OF LADING).     THE RELEASE OF FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION OCCURRED DURING LOADING WHEN THE TANKER TRUCK OVERFLOWED. UPON DISCOVERY OF THE OVERFLOW, THE TSSC OPERATOR QUICKLY RESPONDED BY SHUTTING THE LOADING PUMP OFF. ONE WEEK PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT, THE LOADING PUMP WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW HIGH VOLUME (150 GALLON PER MINUTE) ELECTRIC PUMP TO SPEED UP THE TANKER TRUCK LOADING PROCESS.     THE RELEASED MATERIAL OVERFLOWED THE CONTAINMENT TRENCH INSIDE THE LOADING BAY AND FLOWED ACROSS THE CEMENT ROADWAY ONTO THE GRAVEL ACROSS THE ROAD. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND SUNNY AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE, AND FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION DID NOT ENTER ANY STORM DRAINS. AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, A HEAVY RUBBER SPILL PAD STORED NEAR THE LOADING AREA WAS PLACED ON TOP OF A STORM DRAIN LOCATED SIXTY FEET FROM THE SPILL AREA. THE RELEASED MATERIAL WAS THEN NEUTRALIZED WITH SODIUM BICARBONATE OVER AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 40 SQUARE FEET. THE AREA IMPACTED BY THE RELEASED MATERIAL WAS MONITORED WITH PH PAPER. THE DISCHARGED TO THE OHIO EPA PERMIT NO. 3IC00456*KD, OUTFALL 3IC00056001 WAS ALSO MONITORED, AND A SAMPLE WAS COLLECTED AND ANALYZED (SEE ENCLOSED LABORATORY ANALYSIS). NO PERMIT DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THIS FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION RELEASE. THE FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION RELEASE DID NOT RESULT IN DAMAGE TO ANY WILDLIFE TO ANY WILDLIFE OR VEGETATION OR A THREAT TO HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY. THE AMOUNT OF FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION RELEASED WAS VALUED AT $10, AND THE COST OF THE SODIUM BICARBONATE USED NEUTRALIZE THE RELEASED MATERIAL WAS VALUED AT $1,765.

The driver built a dirt berm to prevent further spreading. Company personnel responded, called a clean up crew and Michigan DEQ. Puddled spillage was vacuumed up. Impacted soil was excavated clean in accordance with Michigan DEQ requirements and removed from the site for disposal.

THE SPILL WAS THE RESULT OF A ROLLOVER AND SUBSEQUENT BREAK IN THE REAR COMPARTMENT OF THE TANKER TRAILER. THE SPILL OCCURRED ON HIGHWAY 125 AT MILE MARKER 68 OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. NO CRUDE SPILLED INTO ANY WATER SOURCE AND  WAS QUICKLY CONTAINED,    BACKGROUND AND PRIOR TRAINING: TURNER HAS CONDUCTED SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR DRIVERS PRIOR TO THEM GOING OUT IN THE FIELD, AND CAN CONFIRM IT CONDUCTED TRAINING WITH MR. CLAY, INCLUDING DRIVING TESTS, REQUIRED SAFETY VIDEOS, RIDE A LONGS WITH OUR CERTIFIED TRAINER, AND STANDARD DIVER SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS. MR. CLAY HAS BEEN WITH TURNER FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 MONTHS AND CAME TO TURNER WITH OVER 5 YEARS OF CRUDE EXPERIENCE, AND APPROXIMATELY 20 YEARS DRIVING EXPERIENCE OVERALL. HE HAS NO MAJOR ACCIDENTS, SPEEDING OR OTHER PRIOR CITATIONS ON HIS MVR THE LAST 5+ YEARS DRIVING. FURTHERMORE, HE HAD BEEN HAULING CRUDE OIL ON THE SAND RIDGE ROUTE SINCE SHORTLY AFTER JUNE 1 (OVER 60 DAYS), AND HAS BEEN ON THIS ROUTE MULTIPLE TIME PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT WITHOUT ANY PRIOR ISSUES.    TUNER GAS HAS CONDUCTED OUR PRELIMINARY INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, RECEIVED THE DRIVER DRUG/ALCOHOL RESULTS AND THE HIGHWAY PATROL VERBAL REPORT.     1 DRIVER REPORT: MR. CLAY INDICATED THAT IT WAS RAINING OUT AND HE WAS GOING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH.  HE HAD CRESTED OVER A HILL ON THE ROAD HEADING NORTH ON HIGHWAY 125, THE ROAD LEVELED OFF, AND BELIEVES HE HEARD A ""POP"" IN THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE TRUCK WHICH CAUSED THE TRUCK TO PULL TO THE RIGHT.  THERE IS A LIMITED SHOULDER ON THIS ROAD TO PULL OVER/CORRECT AND NEXT THING HE KNEW HE WAS IN THE DITCH ROLLED OVER.    2 HIGHWAY PATROL REPORT: TURNER HAS REQUESTED THE FORMAL WRITTEN COLORADO HIGHWAY PATROL REPORT ON 8/ 15, AND THEY SAID IT MAY TAKE UP TO 10 DAYS. WE WILL FORWARD AS SOON AS WE RECEIVE. THE HIGHWAY PATROL DID NOT ISSUE A CITATION TO THE DRIVER AT THE SCENE. IN A VERBAL CONVERSATION WITH MARK MERRITT ON 8/1 5, THE REPORTING OFFICER STATED THAT HE WILL NOT BE ISSUING A CITATION TO THE DRIVER OR TO TURNER FOR ANY EQUIPMENT RELATED ISSUES. THE OFFICER SAID HE DID NOT FIND ANY SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT RELATED ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE CAUSED THIS INCIDENT, BUT ALSO DOES NOT HAVE ANY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE TO LEAD TO THE DRIVER BEING AT FAULT. THE HIGHWAY PATROL ESTIMATED THE DRIVER SPEED LIT BETWEEN 40 AND 45 MPH.    3: TURNER REPORT : THE DRUG/ALCOHOL SCREEN BOTH CAME BACK NEGATIVE (SEE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION), WE HAVE INSPECTED THE EQUIPMENT AS WELL AND CAN FIND NOTHING THAT CAUSED THE ''POP"" THAT THE DRIVER REPORTED THAT WOULD HAVE DIRECTLY CAUSED THIS I INCIDENT. OUR GPS REPORT ON SPEED ALSO CAME BACK UNDER 45 MPH. WE DO NOTE THAT THERE IS LIMITED CELL RECEPTION ON THIS ROUTE SO WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT TO BE A FACTOR. THIS WAS ALSO THE FI","ACTION ITEMS TURNER IS TAKING TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING AGAIN IN THE FUTURE:    1)TURNER HAS CONDUCTED SAFETY TRAINING SINCE THE INCIDENT, AND WILL CONDUCT ADDITIONAL TRAINING SESSIONS OVER THE COMING WEEKS TO REINFORCE PROPER TRAINING/SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EXERCISING MORE CAUTION. DISTRACTIONS ARE PRESENT WITH DRIVING ESPECIALLY ON MOUNTAIN TERMINI. WE ARE THEREFORE CONDUCTING FURTHER SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR THE SAND RIDGE HAUL. THESE TRAINING SESSIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN PERSON IN SMALL 3 PERSON CLASS SETTINGS, AND WILL ALSO INCLUDE ONLINE TRAINING VIDEOS ON DEFENSIVE TANKER DRIVING, SAFE DRIVING, AND A FOCUS ON ANTI-DISTRACTION PROTOCOLS.    2)WE WILL CONDUCT MORE FREQUENT AUDITS TO ENSURE PROTOCOLS ARE BEING MET TO THE STANDARDS TURNER AND SINCLAIR/PRODUCERS REQUIRE.
