Our driver did not observe any failure at the time of shipment nor following the package delivery at Terminal for temporary storage. Following loading of the IsoTank from temporary storage onto a chassis, another driver was conducting a pre-trip inspection when he observed a slow drip of hazardous material onto the chassis from the external cap of the discharge. Duration of the release is estimated at 52 hours. The release stopped after all of the HazMat trapped between the discharge valve and the cover had dripped out.

The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Evonik Corp (Ottis, 251-591-8172).  Hepaco checked the outage, the car had 7 inches of outage.  Hepaco conducted a partial offload and relieved the pressure on the car securing the release.  Evonik will be sending an MRU for repairs.        532 - Thermometer well valve seat    2(5+1+1) x (2+0) = 28 NARRI     Montgomery, AL – 10/12/17 – GATX26787 – Sodium Methylate Solution",(NAR: 532 connection between Thermo well pipe and pressure plate defective and leaking),No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,11050,CSX,US,

He was able to hear it from the ground and also smell it.  He called the Brewster Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis Environmental Officer for WLE.  When I arrived and investigated, I found that the B end liquid valve was not shut all the way and it was leaking through the valve plug which was loose.  I initially could not get the leak to stop by tightening the valve handle.  I had to work the valve open and closed several times to get it to seal.  I think it just had ice in the valve seat since the valve had ice formed on it.  I finally got the valve to seat and the leak stopped.  I tried to open and close the valve several times again to make sure that it was going to stay sealed and it did.  I then put sealant on the valve plug and tightened it.  I removed old seal 0209639 from the protective housing and installed new seal 971789 and then released the car for service.

The driver attempted to stop behind the vehicle but realized he could not do so he veered to the right of the vehicle onto the unimproved shoulder. While maneuvering to the right, the driver immediately tried to steer back to the left causing him to lose control and the weight of the cargo tank caused the truck to overturn onto it's right side.  The truck was traveling at an estimated speed of 23 mph when the vehicle initially began to roll-over.  Due to the truck overturning, product slowly leaked from a loose man way.  Approximately 30 gallons of methanol released from the compartment before emergency services could respond and extract the product from the tank.  The fire department and other emergency services were on scene and provided support while the vehicle was emptied and then uprighted back on it's wheels.  After the truck was removed from the scene, An Environmental contractor performed a site assessment and ensured no further action was needed.",An investigation was completed on this accident and it was determined that the driver had slow reaction time to the truck abruptly stopping in front of him.  He also turned his steering wheel back to the left too aggressively after navigating around the vehicle in front of him which caused his truck to overturn.  This drive had been assigned remedial training to address these deficiencies.  This is the first accident this driver has had in over 20 years as a professional driver.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,104060,Altas Oil Company,US,

A fork lift was then used to try to stabilize the shifted/leaning drums and the fork punctured the drum at the bottom, spilling about 15 gallons (300 #) on the floor of the truck and onto the ground of the loading dock.  The puncture was about 6 inches long x 1 inch.  The spill lasted less than 10 minutes as the driver and customer were able to turn the drum on its side, raising the hole above liquid level in the drum stopping the spill. The hole was temporarily plugged and the drum was placed in an overpack/salvage drum. An absorbent berm was placed on the ground to stop the spread of the liquid. The spill was cleaned up with soda ash, lime and absorbent materials.","To prevent recurrences stronger pallets are being used, improved banding procedures have been implemented, additional training on load securement has occurred, additional driver training regarding control of the delivery of his load will occur.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Maryland Chemical Co.

When he opened 7513 on the 96 dock line he noticed No.2 oil coming from a new flange on the new platform area at tank 7510. The IMTT Field Operator reported the incident to his supervisor and the IMTT Supervisor had him shut the tank immediately.  The incident was then reported to the IMTT Traffic who then called US Ecology (IMTT's OSRO) to respond to the area with a vacuum truck. The IMTT Supervisor contacted the IMTT Maintenance and was informed that a crew will be sent  to tighten up the flange.  The IMTT Operations Supervisor was able to get a box wrench off one of the IMTT Maintenance trucks and started to tighten the flange. The leak stopped and the IMTT Maintenance crew arrived to properly torque the flange.  The US Ecology vacuum truck recovered as much oil on the ground and adjacent storm water collection system as possible.  The IMTT Operations Supervisor was able to confirm that the collection system was shut down and would not be an environmental concern.  US Ecology also dispatched a clean up crew to the area later on during daylight hours.,IMTT conducted a thorough investigation and determined that flange on a new platform area was loose.  It had been tagged to indicate it was properly torqued however upon interviewing the individual who was working on that project he indicated that he failed to confirm that he properly torqued the flange.  The individual was an employee of a contracted company hired by IMTT.  The contractor implemented a program to re-train all employees on the proper torqueing techniques before being allowed to continue working on similar projects at IMTT.,Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,4000,IMTT,US,

It was determined HOKX 112252 was involved in a handling event inside the terminal that resulted in the reclosing pressure relief device to activate and release lading onto a total of 4 freight cars. Joseph Taylor, a CSXT Hazardous Materials Manager performed a visual inspection of the HOKX 112252 pressure relief device and discovered no evident external device defect and in the closed position. The Federal Railroad Administration informed Joseph Taylor the findings of the initial investigation of these freight cars indicated a rough handling and overspeed incident occurred resulting in the hazardous materials release. The car was isolated and Occidental Chemical Corporation, National Response Center, and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation were notified.  SUNPRO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and removed all product from the exterior of the impacted freight cars. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Mr. Gary Blasius of Occidental Chemical Corporation, phone 716-525-5839. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move. 7.1 is not required.

This error caused material to be pulled from the storage tank thus backing up into the trailer.  Approximately 165 gallons of Exxsol D60 was released out of the top manway of the trailer before the pump was shut off. The Exxsol D60 released was completely contained in the sump underneath the unloading area, and was subsequently pumped into drums for disposal. Residual product on trailer was rinsed off, before advising driver and Dana Trucking's safety coordinator to proceed to a truck wash bay. Residual product on the offloading area surface was absorbed with Speedi-Dri and collected.

Contractor estimates that approximately 2 quarts of product has been released to the side of the tanker and asphalt. Contractor will use absorbents and portland cement to clean the release.  Contractor has finished initial cleanup activities. Contractor indicated that they have taped absorbent pads to the tanker as a precaution. Contractor believes that the released was caused due to the gasket of a washout cap. Contractor indicated that the gasket may be incompatible with the product. Contractors are onsite and confirm the leak is coming from a weld crack between the tanker shell and manifold, not the washout caps as previous thought.Contractors confirm the transfer is complete and they are getting ready to leave site.

Two of those bulging drums had ruptured their venting cap membrane, leading to a very small release of less than one ounce of waste, combined. These drums were in containment; no ground, soil, or water sources were impacted. An emergency response crew was summoned. Outfitted with the appropriate personal protective equipment, this crew safely relieved the pressure on all the affected drums, took analytical samples to determine the nature of the pressure build up. The generator was contacted, and a plan to chemically treat this waste was implemented. After the waste was fully stabilized, the bulging drums (including the ones which had leaked) were transferred to new drums of the appropriate UN specification. As of this writing, there is still one bulging drum with stabilized waste to be transferred into a fresh drum. The newly packaged drums have been shipped to their final destination without incident. The one remaining drum will be shipped to it's final destination soon.     This was initially reported and updated to the State of Connecticut DEEP Case #2017-5168.","At the time these drums were initially transported, there was no sign of pressure buildup, bulging, or of a release from damaged drum vent diaphragms. This particular waste stream had been an issue in the past, which had caused CHES to suspend this waste stream until arrangements could be made with the generator to amend the manufacturing process that produced this waste, and to have the generator take additional steps to ensure this waste stream was stable through the temperature and vibrations of transit. This load was one of the first after re-accepting this waste profile. As a result of this continuing issue, CHES will no longer accept this waste stream into transit.",No,JERRICAN,Non-removable head plastic jerrican,3H1,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc.,US,

The pump was being used to load the barge B-280 on Pier 1/W when he and another IMTT Field Operator noticed the release on their pump check. They immediatley shut down the pump from the sub station. The IMTT Emergency Response Team was called as well as IMTT Maintenance, Safety, and US Ecology (IMTT's OSRO).  The responders along with IMTT Maintenance dept. were able to stop the release which was coming from a broken nipple on a pressure relief line. The IMTT Maintenance dept. replaced the nipple and the IMTT Emergency Responders suppressed the vapors by laying a foam blanket down and diverting the flow gasoline to a collection point.",A preliminary investigation determined that the nipple cracked off the discharge side of the Pit 3 south pump due to vibration and metal fatigue.  A Root Cause Analysis will be performed and Action Items assigned including changing the relief thread from schedule 80 to 160; perform a Pressure Cycle Fatigue Analysis on all similar reliefs; and a survey of all pump pad and relief piping.

These loads are transferred by pump. The railcar vent valve is connected to the truck trailer during this process and a small amount of pressure is built up in the car. The loader closed all the valves before disconnecting the hoses. He then removed the loading adaptor from the railcar siphon pipe before equalizing the pressure (These cars are not equipped with a siphon pipe valve) resulting in a spent acid release. There was minimal pressure in the car from the pump transfer, a different loader went up the railcar and opened the vent valve and the spill was stopped. The car spilled for approximately 30 seconds on to asphalt containment. We contacted Clean Harbors and they responded and cleaned the spill. I notified the National Response Center and the Oregon Emergency Response System of this incident.","As a result of this incident we reviewed the transfer SOP focusing on disconnecting after transfers and the dangers of built up pressure. A new procedure has been written specifically for spent acid transfers which specifically targets this incident with a step by step system designed to prevent this and other possible failures. PT Railroad Services is a very small company of 8 employees and we take our commitment to safety very serious. We have safely handled transfers with out a lost time injury for 2,173 days.

One of those vehicles stopped in the road and was rear-ended by the other vehicle. This pushed the stopped vehicle into our driver and to avoid a head-on collision, our driver swerved to the right but couldn't avoid contact with the vehicle. This caused our CTMV to over-turn on the roadway. The overturned vehicle began to leak liquid propane from a sheered off vapor return valve that connect the meter vapor eliminator to the cargo tank. Liquid was released through the excess flow valve that functioned properly and only leaked past the weep hole. This is a vapor valve in the cargo tank but it leaked liquid because the cargo tank was on its side. The local fire service controlled the leaking propane by using water fog patterns to dissipate the propane vapor. There was no physical damage to the cargo tank other than the lifting lugs being bent. Propane leaked an estimated 10-12 hrs. Propane liquid was removed from the overturned cargo tank except for approx. 300 gallons before the CTMV was uprighted. Once uprighted the remaining 300 gallons was removed and the vehicle was hauled away.","I don't have any recommendations in this case as to how our driver could have avoided this accident.

AS IT HAPPENED IN THIS INCIDENT, THE TRANSFER HOSE WAS ATTACHED ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE RAIL TANK CARAS THE BOTTOM VAVLE HANDLE. WHEN THE THREE INCH HOSE RUPTURED, IT PUSHED THE RAIL TANK CAR VALVE HANDLE OUT OF THE RETAINING PIPE AND THE VALVE HANDLE FELL TO THE GROUND, IN A PUDDLE OF RELEASED PHOSPHORIC ACID. IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SAFE FOR A PERSON TO RETRIEVE THE VALVE HANDLE IN A PUDDLE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE RELEASE. A SUGGESTION IS TO EXAMINE THE DESIGN OF THE HANDLE OF THE TANK CAR.  VERDEGGAL BROTHERS, INC. HAS MADE A POLICY CHANGE, TO ALWAYS POSITION THE TRUCK TANKER ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TANK CAR WHERE THE VALVE IS LOCATED. THE TANK CAR WILL BE POSITIONED ON THE RAIL SIDING SO THIS CAN BE DONE. THIS WAY, THE OPERATOR CAN IMMEDIATELY GO TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TANK CAR AND CLOSE THE VALVE.

When he crossed the tracks his dolly legs struck the track. The legs were forced up and ruptured compartment #2 that had 1500 gallons of UL E87. The hole was approximately 2"" in diameter in the bottom of the compartment.(About the size of a quarter). The fuel didn't start to come out of the compartment until he got a few hundred yards down the road. Mike drove about another quarter mile before realizing something was wrong. He stopped and saw his trailer was leaking fuel out. Mike then called Dispatch. Lykins notified local emergency services. Liberty Fire Department was first on the scene. The Safety Dept. was notified and made all necessary reports. Then headed to the scene where the environmental company (SES), local sheriff and IDEM met up with Lykins Safety Department. Liberty Fire and Rescue was able to slow the leak and Union County Co-Op pumped out the gas from the compartment and delivered it to Camden BP. SES proceeded to clean up the gas that was spilled according to the requirements by IDEM.","We have advised our drivers that if they have a new location to deliver to, to verify with dispatch on an appropriate route to take.

He immediately applied his brakes but was unable to avoid contact with two other vehicles.  One vehicle impacted the bulk liquid tanker.  The impact to the trailer damaged a temperature gauge and resulted in product being released onto the roadway.  The Port Arthur fire department responded and applied a sealing putty to the tanker to minimize the release and oil booms to contain the spill.  The product was transferred out of the damaged tanker.  Once the damaged tanker was removed from the scene, SWS Environmental Services began a clean-up of the scene.  They utilized absorbent pads, absorbent booms and floor dry to clean-up the spill.  No product was released onto the soil or any waterways.",This bridge does not have any shoulder available for disabled vehicles and is of an older construction with a very steep grade.  The steep grade does not allow visibility of issues with traffic until after you crest the bridge.

Two walk-around oxygen cylinders had been used by the Flight Attendants during the emergency.  Upon landing in LNK, the cylinders needed to be replaced to make the aircraft airworthy.  Two replacement cylinders were ferried from ORD to LNK.  An AA Aircraft Mechanic was on-board Flight 272 and volunteered to replace the oxygen cylinders in the cabin.  After completion of the work, the Aircraft Mechanic, Captain of the ferry aircraft or ground personnel with the FBO in LNK inadvertently loaded the used cylinders into the cargo compartment of the ferry aircraft for return to ORD.  One cylinder was completely empty.  However, the other used cylinder had approximately 250 PSI of oxygen remaining.  The cylinders were placed back in the American Airlines owned DOT31FP compliant boxes but not declared as required and not reported to the Captain via NOTOC as required.  The packages were discovered by American Airlines Stores personnel after they had been offloaded from the returning ferry aircraft as which time they reported the discrepancy to management.","Better training of Aircraft Mechanics and Flight Crew to understand that these are hazmat parts that cannot fly unless all regulatory requirements have been satisfied.
