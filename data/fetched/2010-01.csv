No further first aid was required.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT  After the caustic trailer was unloaded, the driver disconnected the unloading hose while under pressure.  The driver assumed the hose and line pressure had been bled from the system.  The driver and unit process technician were splashed with caustic (approximately 2 gallons sprayed/spilled).  Both employees had minimal skin contact and were flushed with water immediately (first aid only).  No additional first aid treatment or any medical treatment was required.","All drivers are to verify with the plant operator that the unloading hose has been depressurized prior to disconnect.

Upon arrival at the disposal facility, the roll-off container was being removed from the vehicle when approximately 50 pounds of material escaped from the top of the roll-off container onto the fully contained off-loading area.  Facility personnel immediately halted the off-loading procedure and initiated a clean-up.  Wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, facility personnel removed the material and placed it back into the roll-off and then proceeded to decontaminate the off-loading area.  All materials used in this operation were placed into the roll-off and was disposed of at the intended waste management facility.","At the time the shipment was accepted for transportation, the load was inspected and no evidence of liquid was observed and the load was evenly distributed within the container.  Upon arrival at the disposal facility, it is believed that during the course of transportation, residual liquid separated from the solid material causing a small amount of sludge to form. It is believed that the liquid component was rainwater that had collected under the tarp during the time the loading was complete and the container was accepted for transportation.  Due to the angle at which the container was off-loaded from the roll-off frame, this sludge was able to flow over the top of the container.      In order to prevent a recurrence, the driver and off-loading personnel have been instructed to insure that the load is inspected prior to removing the container from the frame.  If evidence of liquid or sludge is observed, steps must be taken to either solidify the liquid or reduce the angle at which the container is off-loaded to preclude the unintentional release of material from the package.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

Later on 01/06/2010, the customer also informed us that the delivered container to NYCT had no placards.  That is why I am filing the incident report of undeclared dg cargo.     The customer removed out the container from NYCT, and applied placards.  The customer also submitted a dg declaration to us in order for us to process our approval.  Afterwards when we approved the dg declaration on 01/13/2010, the placarded container was re-delivered to NYCT. The dg cargo will be shipping out with APL Malaysia 142ET (eta NYC: 01/20/2010) to Bremerhaven port, Germany.  Should you require anything else, please contact.

The fill line for the storage tank was near the top, on the side.  At first the driver didn't think anything was moving through his hose but he thought he heard it going into tank.  When the hose went light, he figured the trailer might be empty.  There was no shut off valve on the customer storage tank and driver was concerned about that because it was on the side of the tank and he didn't know the level of the product in the tank.  Driver had trouble reaching the connection so he got a stick to carefully work the ear loose on the hose connection.  At that time, product starting leaking out into the containment area.  The driver had full PPE on just in case but no product got on him.  It drained into the containment area until the tank level was below the fill line.

The unloading operator pressured up the tank with nitrogen for off loading.  During this process the operator noticed liquid dripping from underneath trailer skin about five feet from nose of trailer.  At that time the operator placed a catch bucket under drip and released the pressure off the tank.  Detemination was made by the plant operator and safety staff to transload material to another trailer.  This was properly done without any incident.  After unloading the tank was taken to local tankwash and cleaned.  After that to the shop where it was inspected by the shop foreman.

Approximately 50 gallons of sodium hydroxide solution were released from the tank on the vehicle.  The free product released to the asphalt roadway, dirt along the road shoulder, and within a nearby storm drain catch basin.  Sarasota County Environmental responded to assess the site, along with the Venice City Fire Department.  Free product was contained with the application of absorbent material to the asphalt surface.  The Venice Fire Department also applied vinegar to the free liquid and water within the drain, to neutralize the free product.      Southern Waste Services of Cape Coral, Florida was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Southern Waste Services pumped one (1) drum of free product and water from the impacted drain, which was pH tested, and returned neutral.  Southern Waste Services also tested the free liquid within the connecting storm drain system, which also returned neutral.  Southern Waste Services proceeded to recover the spent absorbents, and hand shoveled the impacted soil along the road shoulder.  All waste was containerized into two (2) 55-gallon drums, pending disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.      Alison Eggleston, Sarasota County Environmental Specialist, along with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, discussed cleanup actions taken, and were satisfied with course of action.  No further action was required.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.    Two (2) 55-gallon drums of spent absorbent material, contaminated soil, and PPE were transported by SWS First Response to Clark Environmental, Inc. of Mulberry, Florida for disposal.

GATX 53416 was cordoned off in the railyard. A BNSF contract responder reported that the spillage emanated from the manway closure. The manway cover had no seals applied and 5 of 6 of the square nuts applied on the manway securement bolts were less than tool tight by up to 10 turns. The responder properly tool tightened all manway securement bolt nuts in the prescribed ordered pattern. Dried spillage on the top and side shell of GATX 53416 was diluted and washed with a bleach/water solution. Response was concluded by 1330 hrs. CST, 1/04/10.   Later, GATX 53416 was relocated to the facility repair track for air brake related repairs. While on the repair track, a chemical odor was reported emanating from GATX 53416. The same BNSF contract responder reinspected GATX 53416 and this detailed inspection of the manway closure revealed that the manway gasket was missing. This deficiency was not detected at the 1/04/10 response. The responder applied a new manway gasket and resecured all manway securement bolt nuts. Now that the manway closure was completely sealed, no further product odor was evident. Response was concluded by 0900 hrs.

Impose a temporary embargo on transportation of shipments of hazardous materials/dangerous goods on passenger aircraft from Argentina to the United States (embargo will continue until the Department of Operation Security is satisfied following a review and audit of new hazardous materials/dangerous goods handling procedures (described below) in our Argentina stations).    2. The Contact Center (Cargo Reservations) in Argentina has been instructed to notate “CAO USG13” on all applicable bookings at the time of reservation. This notation will be printed in the manifest used by our Export Department in Argentina to prepare the corresponding flight.    3. The Operations Department in Argentina has been instructed to place a stamp on all hazardous materials/dangerous goods check lists using one of two colors:     BLUE: For shipments that may be transported on PAX flights and comply with the USG13.    RED: For shipments that must be transported on CAO flights with final destination in the United States or in transit via the United States as per USG13.    4. The Export Department in Argentina has been instructed to ensure better control of booking information, review/completion of hazardous materials/dangerous goods check list, and review of the dangerous goods declarations, manifests, and air waybills of the corresponding flight. Export Department personnel as also been instructed to ensure detailed review and briefing regarding all documentation provided to flight dispatchers    5. Additionally, the Export Department will ensure better recordkeeping of booking documentation/information as a proof that the shipments comply with USG13 (such documentation shall include a record of the signature, and the date and the time of the Export Department employee who receives the documents). All relevant records will be retained in the corresponding flight folder.    6.

(VESTS) personnel were making three hazardous material pick-ups during the day.      The first material pick up occurred at Nippon Express USA, in Grove City Ohio.  The customer had 2 boxes of the lithium batteries in blister packs.  The crew decided to package these materials by unpackaging the expired button cell primary lithium batteries and consolidating them into a 5-gallon poly container.  The battery terminals were not secured or protected in violation with the VESTS battery packaging guideline requirements and USDOT hazardous materials regulations.  The 5 gal pail was loaded onto the truck and secured for shipment.      At customer pick up #2, the VESTS employees loaded four (4) 55-gallon drums of flammable liquid, n.o.s.  The VESTS employees then proceeded to customer pick up #3 and loaded an additional two (2) 55-gallon containers of flammable liquids, n.o.s.  There were no signs of heating or off gassing of any of the materials at the time of departure.    Approximately 15 minutes into the trip on Highway 161 westbound a VESTS employee heard a loud bang and thought that the truck lift-gate had fallen to the ground.  He stopped immediately to inspect the vehicle.  It was determined that the vehicle was on fire and the VESTS employees enacted the transportation contingency plan.      One employee contacted 911 and the other stopped vehicles and bystanders from approaching the vehicle.      Arriving at the fire was the Columbus Fire Department Unit Four Fire division.  Also responding was the Ohio EPA Division of Emergency and Remedial response, the Columbus police, and the Columbus investigation fire team.      The Columbus FD cut the driver’s side of the box away to gain access.  They proceeded to hit the back of the truck (to include the drums of waste) with a water/foam extinguishing media.  It appears they actively fought the fire for 15-30 minutes.  Once the fire was extinguished, they continued to monitor with heat guns and thermal imaging as a precaution.    VESTS conducted the remediation of the clean-up with oversight by the OEPA.  All debris from the fire was removed from the F-750.  VESTS generated 4 debris drums from the charred contents on the floor of the box of the F-750.  The drums that had been exposed to fire and had integrity issues were repacked and over-packed.  The hazardous drums were shipped utilizing the original manifests.  A manifest was generated for the shipment of the fire debris.  All of the material involved or generated from the fire was shipped off of the site Wednesday evening.  VESTS’ West Carrollton Ohio facility was the destination location for all of the containers.","Veolia ES Technical Solutions, L.L.C. has a battery packaging guideline policy with respect to shipment of Lithium Batteries.  The employees involved in the shipment had access and training to the policy.  However, they did not follow the mandated policy which requires terminal protection against short circuiting.  Had the policy been followed, this incident would most likely not have occurred.     Immediately following the incident, Veolia suspend all movement of Lithium Battery shipments nationwide until all containers could be inspected for proper terminals securement.  All employees involved with the packaging and shipment of Lithium Batteries were retrained on the policy requirements and DOT requirements to secure battery terminals.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Allied Universal (contact Todd Tucker - 903-987-3248) was notified via CHEMTREC (Report # 2010-01-09-00088). SWS/Eagle, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene. Upon arrival, SWS/Eagle representatives removed intact seal #380642 from the protective housing and found the A + B end liquid valves and the left side vapor valve not properly closed and all plugs less than tool tight. The valves were tightened one and one half turns and the four plugs were tightened one full turn. The leak stopped after the valves and plugs were secured and the car was released for transport.

SRIX 83106 was cordoned off in the railyard. After further inspection, SRIX 83106 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard. BNSF hazardous material responders reported intact valve housing seal WRC 1119935 was removed from the valve housing cover for valve inspection. The vapor valve closure plug was found not tool tight, but it wasn't the leak source. This closure plug was properly tool tightened. The threaded liquid valve was found loose on its threaded connection and was the leak source. The responders removed the liquid valve, cleaned its threads, applied new thread sealant, reinserted the valve into its orifice and properly tool tightened this liquid valve. Afterwards, no further liquid product release was observed from the threaded liquid valve connection. The vacuum relief valve on SRIX 83106 was also removed to provide clearance when the liquid valve was removed. The vacuum relief valve had new sealant applied to its threads and then was reinserted and tool tightened. A BNSF contractor assisted and cleaned spillage from the shell of SRIX 83106 and absorbed non-evaporated spillage that had puddled under SRIX 83106.  The valve housing cover was then closed, secured and resealed.  The side specification stencil on SRIX 83106 indicated that the last tank qualification was completed in the year 2000 and next due in 2010.

Initially, CPCX 102010 and CPCX 102019 were identified as possible odor sources, but these tank cars were found all secure and not the odor source. Further investigation revealed PSPX 22149 (DOT 105J500W tank car) as the odor source. BNSF responders, assisted by contract responders, reported that the A-end liquid valve on PSPX 22149 was emanating residue product vapor via the valve stem of this liquid valve. The valve was in the closed position and its packing retainer nut was tight; therefore the valve stem packing was suspected as the cause of the residue product vapor release. Responders inserted additional valve stem packing material around the valve stem and then retightened the packing retainer nut. Afterwards, the vapor release ceased and all odors dissipated. The valve housing cover was resealed with a BNSF seal. Securement was completed by 1100 hrs. CST, 1/13/2010.

(VES-TS) is a hazardous waste Transfer, Storage, and Disposal Facility (TSDF) that operates in West Carrollton, OH.  The facility receives containers of hazardous waste from various locations within the United States of America.  VES-TS had received an IBC that had a modified valve from a generator.  The modified valve allowed the valve outlet to extend beyond the IBCs body.  VES-TS loaded the IBC with the modified valve onto a trailer next to another IBC for transportation to the disposal.  Veolia ES Industrial Services (VES-IS) conducted the transportation of the trailer.  While VES-IS was transporting the trailer, the IBC with the modified valve punctured a small hole in the body of the IBC containing Hydrochloric Acid (HCL).  The hole was located approximately 8 inches from the bottom of the IBC.  The hole was approximately ¼ inch tall and ½ inch long.    Approximately 133 gallons of HCL acid was released.  The emergency response clean-up crew used absorbent to clean-up the liquid in the truck and on the road.  The spill-up material and impacted soil was containerized and removed from the location.  The remaining 35 gallons of HCL in the tote was decanted off into another UN-rated drum.","The following corrective/preventive measures will be  implemented:  1) Review the incident with effected employees.  2) Retraining all of all effected employees on the  shipment requirements for Totes:  a.

Quality Carrier arrived at Vertex with a tractor-trailer to pick up a load of Sodium Hydroxide (UN1824) for Dow Chemical.  The driver spotted the trailer in the trailer loading area.  This area is designed to contain any spill  and this spill was completely contained.   The Vertex operator set the load meter to transfer the product from the tank to the trailer.  The Vertex operator started the pump and loading began.  The meter was reading slow and the operator thought the hose might be frozen and contacted the plant maintenance personnel.  While maintenance personnel were trying to determine why the meter was reading slow, the trailer overflowed for approximately 20 seconds.  Approximately 140 gallons overflowed the trailer into the containment area.  No product was released into the environment.  It was discovered that the meter was incorrectly calibrated for a ¾ inch pipe instead of a 4 inch pipe.  The meter had been recently replaced and had not been re-calibrated per Vertex Procedures.  Dow Chemical requested that Vertex call Chemtrec to report the spill.",Re-training was completed with the operators and plant maintenance personnel to review meter operation and calibration.

Subsequent investigations revealed that the liquids were rainwater and snowmelt that contacted F037 sludge left from prior deliveries of the same waste. Buckets were placed beneath the leaks. Chemical Waste Management of the Northwest (CWMNW) provided response personnel. The CWMNW personnel determined that the drain pipe caps on the open gondola railcars were not tight - allowing the dripage. The two railcars were unloaded on the afternoon of January 4 and the morning of January 5. There was no evidence that rainwater contacted any materials inside the inner packaging in the railcar. On January 11, the spill area was excavated and confirmation sampling conducted to make sure all impacted material was removed.","In order to minimize similar future events, personnel will tarp gondola railcars containing hazardous waste to prevent precipitation from entering gondolas when rain or snow is forecast while gondola loads are in the transfer station yard.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1200,CWMNW,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, Bowater, Inc. was notified via CHEMTREC (Report # 2010-01-27-00034). Hepaco, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that the 20"" manway nozzle gasket was damaged due to misalignment.  In addition, the response team found one (1) manway securement bolt/nut less than tool tight.  The proper size gasket was initially unavailable so a temporary gasket was installed.  Hepaco personnel returned to the railcar on January 28th to replace the nozzle gasket and properly secure the container for transportation.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to Bowater's representative, Calvin Cato at 803-981-8659.  This incident did require a special switching move.

PSPX 22142 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard. A BNSF hazardous material responder was called and inspected PSPX 22142. Intact seal CPC 240965 was removed from the valve housing cover for valve inspection. Product odor was present when the valve housing cover was lifted. All valves and fittings were found secure. Visual leak detection using soap/water solution did not reveal any leak source. A photo-ionization detector (PID) was then used and the PID registered a maximum reading of 20 ppm of product near the vapor valve stem. The responder loosened the packing retainer nut on the vapor valve stem and inserted additional packing around the stem. The packing retainer nut was tightened. Afterwards, the valve housing area atop the pressure plate was cleansed with a bleach solution for odor abatement. Further PID probes indicated no detectable readings. The valve housing cover was closed and sealed with BNSF seal numbered 1804. The shipper elected to have PSPX 22142 returned for their root cause investigation. No further incidents were reported during the return trip of PSPX 22142.

Initial reports indicated that no product had impacted the ground. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder immediately inspected PROX 44194. The responder reported finding 2 of 8 manway securement bolts less than tool tight. These loose securement bolts were adjacent to one another which likely prevented a good closure seal and allowed product expulsion during movement. The responder opened the manway cover to inspect the manway gasket; and it was found to be in place and in good condition. The manway cover was closed and the manway securement bolts were properly tool tightened. Securement was completed by 1300 hrs. CST, 1/13/2010.

A leak test showed a definite leak coming from the Vapor Line flange.  USES personnel tightened the bolts and checked for leaks.  No leaks were detected.  The entire area was sprayed down with a deodorizer, and a new seal was installed on the lid.  The car was secured and released back to the railroad for transport at approximately 1715 hours.

The manway cover was opened to check the product outage level and the manway gasket condition. The product outage was deemed appropriate. The manway gasket was found out of position with a portion of this gasket near the manway hinge folded over and not in the manway lid's gasket track. This prevented a good closure seal. The old gasket was removed, the gasket track was cleaned and a new gasket applied.  The manway cover was closed and properly resecured. Visible spillage that did not evaporate was wiped. No further product release was evident during subsequent movements in the railyard. Response was concluded by 1410 hrs. CST, 1/31/2010.

Unit 2 began to lose control and “fish tail” on the icy roadway.  Op #1 observed Unit 2 losing control and crossed over into the northbound lane of travel to avoid a collision.  The front end of Unit 1 struck the back right corner of Unit 2’s trailer in the northbound passing lane.  The impact caused Unit 2 to jackknife and slide off the west side of SR 219.  Unit 1 continued south for approx 200 feet, crossed back through the southbound lane of travel, rotated approx 180 degrees in a clockwise direction and overturned off the west side of SR 219.       On Friday, January 22, 2010 at 0650 hours EST, Ms. Terry Budd, from Quality Distribution’s Sky Tank contacted American Compliance Technologies, Inc. (A•C•T) Nationwide Project Manager, Mr. Gary L. Weiss to request assistance with a liquid aluminum sulfate and diesel fuel spill. The spill occurred on highway 219 and California Road in Ridgeway, Pennsylvania.  Mr. Budd advised that tractor-tanker #23006 was involved in a roll-over accident and released both liquid aluminum sulfate from the tanker and diesel fuel from the saddletanks. An estimated 100 gallons liquid aluminum sulfate and 75-gallons of diesel fuel was released. The PA-DEP and National Response Center was notified of this incident by first responders.     Upon arrival at the site, our response team advised that a Fleet Transit truck crossed traffic lanes that caused the Quality Carriers truck to roll-over into a ditch. They observed the tanker leaking liquid aluminum Sulfate from the 2-inch vent located at the top manifold of the tanker.  Additionally and estimated 75-gallos of diesel fuel was released onto the soil in the ditch. The tow company was already on site and had secured the tanker with straps.  Three (3) 5-gallon pails were being used to collect the product leaking from the tanker.  Additionally the Clearfield County Haz-Mat Team has placed a 95-gallons overpack drum to collect the leaking product.  A soil berm was built to contain the released aluminum sulfate.    After a safety briefing from A•C•T and donning proper PPE our response team began the process of transloading the remaining liquid aluminum sulfate from the damaged tanker to a new tanker supplied by Quality Carriers.  Once the product was off-loaded, the tow company up righted and removed the damaged tractor-tanker.  The clean product collected in the overpack drum was added to the new tanker.  The aluminum sulfate impacted soil berm and the soil area within the berm, measuring 10-feet by 10-feet, was hand excavated and placed into three (3) 55-gallon drums for disposal.      Our response team then addressed the area impacted by the released diesel fuel from the passenger side saddle tank.  Utilizing a skid-steer, diesel saturated soil and snow was excavated and placed into a 20-yard roll-off container.

BNSF operating and mechanical responders immediately inspected NAHX 3020 finding the A-end compartment's side sills had cracked and split apart. The side sill separation resulted in a side sheet split on both sides of NAHX 3020 at the lower end side sheet with lading spilling from these openings. NAHX 3020 was cordoned-off. The B-end compartment was intact and did not release any product.  BNSF contractors were called to transfer the remaining product from the compromised A-end of NAHX 3020; and remediate spillage in the yard track leading up to where NAHX 3020 came to rest. Remaining product from the A-end compartment was off-loaded into super sacks and trucked back to the shipper. The product on the ground was removed, along with impacted ballast, ties and soil which were placed into covered roll-off containers, profiled and transported to an off-site approved chemical waste management facility. Afterwards, NAHX 3020 was carefully moved and staged over plastic in an isolated area within the BNSF railyard complex. NAHX 3020's B-end compartment product was off-loaded during the week of March 1, 2010 and product returned to the shipper. NAHX 3020 was then cleaned and purged of all hazardous material.",BNSF requested that the AAR issue an Early Warning for inspection of rail cars of similar design and construction.,Yes,HOPPER,Rail hopper car for solid materials only,HOPPER R,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,217000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Once back at the depot the cargo tank was evacuated.","We have a safety review committee and the recommendations that came out of that process were judged on road conditions.

The PWC Fire and HazMat team were well trained, supportive and utilized the opinions of the industry during this incident.

Our driver was coming around a curve and the driver & a witness said the other carrier was pulling off of the shoulder back onto the roadway.  He was partially on the roadway with no lights on so our driver ended up colliding with the other carrier.  We were cited originally but that was later recinded.  The resulting collision caused a fire causing our truck and trailer and the other carrier's trailer as a total loss.  The other carrier was hauling resin which caught fire and burned to entirety.  Per the telephonic PHMSA report sent to me it advised that the Schneider truck was hauling 300 pounds of a corrosive material and an undetermined amount of flammable liquid.      There was in fact no corrosive material on board the Schneider trailer.  I confirmed with the shipper (FedEx) and the spill response team that the only thing on our trailer was 90 pounds of cigarette lighters.  Based on the paperwork I believe confusion existed as there was 300 pounds of a material but they were cigars (not sure how someone got corrosive out of that).  Based on the 5800 exceptions each box weighed 45 pounds and total release was less than 5.2 gallons which is why I never filled out the 5800 report form initially.",While we believe this was not our drivers fault the driver will go through remedial training regarding awareness to ensure the driver is demonstrating the right behavriors.

The product is first packaged in a triple layer plastic bag and then stored in fiberboard drums. Approximately 1 gallon of slurry (5 kg of PETN in 25% water) was released from the containers.     Maxam provided advice as to how to manage the situation which included using no metal shovels, no smoking, spray down the product before sweeping it up, contain the area and repack the ruptured drums in another container that will hold water.  The advice appeared to be well received.  Unfortunately, when the Fire Mrshall arrived on the scene, they sprayed the entire container with water, not just the spilled product.    Once the 2 damaged drums were processed, we noticed that additional drums in the container had collapsed as a result of the fire departments attempt to desensitize the PETN with water.  These drums were overpacked before shipment.      In all, 61 fiberboard drums were unacceptable for transportation and were repackaged.  Of these, 48 were due to container suitability issues and 13 were ""assumed"" to be leaking.  The 13 drums were contaminated with mineral oil and will need to be detroyed.  The other 48 units have been repackaged in approved containers.  All other drums are in good and useable condition.","Maxam has instituted a policy where any spill will require the immediate presence of trained Maxam personnel.  The information provided by Mr. Labelle and Mr. Francelj was correct and if followed would have safely addressed the issue.  We believe that the intital incident, caused by careless handling by the stevedoring employee, was further exacerbated by the subsequent handling practices.  We are happy to provide training whenever we are asked to Emergency Responders, Fire Departments etc. Our goal is zero accidents and incidents, and, if they occur, the safe and efficient handling of such incidents to mitigate damage to the population and the environment.",Yes,DRUM NON-METAL,"Fiber drum, cont1 for solids, cont2 for liquids",DRUM FBR,No,,,,XX,,,3240,0,0,0,0,0,50,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,106689,"Maxam North America,Inc.",US,

The bag was removed and two small streams of acid impacted bin ""d"" approximately 3/4s of the bin from the bulkhead back. The box was secured, inspected and determined to contain a single automotive spillable battery that appeared to be new (terminals capped). It is unclear if the fluid leaked due to pressure changes or if the battery tipped during transportation or the unloading process.The passenger baggage originated in Fort Meyers (RSW) and flew flight number 3161 to Chicago Midway (MOW) where it transferred to flight number 963 from MOW to PIT. There were no sign of leakage on the first flight segment and inspections of the aircraft supported no leakage on the first leg. Ramp Supervisors immediately contacted Corporate Safety and notified the Captain. Maintenance Control brought a contract mechanic to the aircraft and the Dispatch Department took the aircraft out of service for the remainder of the day as Southwest Mechanics were dispatched to neutralize the spill and perform maintenance inspections.Upon investigation into the shipment, the battery was transported in a propane heater box (propane and/or heater not present) and the Customer Service Agent was informed by the passenger that there was a ""regular"" battery in the box. No further visual inspection or questioning of the Passenger occurred and the box was accepted as passenger baggage. The spill was reported to the FAA (Special Agent Joe Ballas) and the National Response Center.",Additional Training and individual coaching on existing policy regarding batteries (within company).
