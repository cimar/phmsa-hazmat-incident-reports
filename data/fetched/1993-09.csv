THE DRIVER WAS TRANSPORTING THE MATERIAL FROM OUR WILDWOOD STORES FACILITY IN WILDWOOD, FLORIDA TO OUR SUWANEE RIVER POWER PLANT.  THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVING ALONG COUNTY ROAD 466, APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES NORTH OF WILDWOOD WHEN THE STEEL SECURING BANDS AROUND THE DRUMS BROKE ALLOWING TWO DRUMS OF THE PRODUCT TO FALL OFF THE TRANSPORT TRAILER.  ONE DRUM OF LIQUICHLOR RUPTURES AND LEAKED PRODUCT ONTO THE ROADSIDE AND TO AN ADJOINING PROPERTY. THE SECOND DRUM REMAINED INTACT AND DID NOT LEAK.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED HIS SUPERVISOR WHO GOT IN CONTACT WITH THE FPC ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT.  AFTER REVEIWING THE MSDS FOR THE PRODUCT IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE AMOUNT SPILLED WAS LESS THAN THE RQ FOR THE PRODUCT.  IN ADDITION, IT WAS DTERMINED THAT NONE OF THE DOT CRITERIA REQUIRING IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION OF THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS MET.  FROM THE MSDS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT FLUSHING THE SPILL WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER WAS THE RECOMMENDED CLEANUP METHOD. BECAUSE OF AN APPROACHING RAIN, STORM, THE ENTIRE INCIDENT SITE WAS FLUSHED WITH RAIN WATER WITHIN ONE HOUR OF THE LEAK.  THE RUPTURED DRUM WAS PLACED INSIDE A SECOND VEHICLE, SECURED AND RETURNED TO WILDWOOD.  THE SECOND, INTACT DRUM, WAS REMOVED FROM THE ROADSIDE, RETURNED TO THE ORIGINAL DELIVERY TRAILER, SECURED AND SENT WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE DELIVERY TO SUWANEE PLANT.  UPON RETURNING TO THE WILDWOOD FACILITY (APPROX. 5:15pm) THE SUPERVISOR CONTACTED THE PROPERTY OWNER AND TOLD HER WHAT HAPPENED, GAVE HER THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT THAT HAD SPILLED ON HER PROPERTY.  SHE WAS ALSO PROVIDED A FPC CONTACT NUMBER INCASE SHE HAS ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.

HIS REPORTED SPEED AT THAT TIME WAS 30 MPH.  HE WAS TRAVELING IN THE RIGHT LANE.  ABOUT 25 FEET ONTO THE RAMP HE FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE TRUCK SHIFT LEFT TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE OF THE CURVE. HE LOOKED TO THE LEFT AND SAW A CAR THERE IN THAT LANE, TRAVELING AT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED.  HE ATTEMPTED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT WITHIN HIS LANE, SLOWING TO A REPORTED SPEED OF 25 MPH.  HE THEN SAW THE RIGHT REAR TANDEMS LEAVE THE GROUND.  AFTER THE CAR PASSED, HE ATTEMPTED TO REGAIN THE BALANCE OF HIS VEHICLE BY STRAIGHTENING OUT SOME MORE, BUT THE TRAILER WAS ALREADY ON ITS WAY OVER.  THE FORCE OF THE TRAILER ROLLING OVER IMMEDIATELY PULLED THE TRACTOR OVER ON ITS SIDE.  BOTH THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER SLID ABOUT 20 FEET (ON THEIR RIGHT SIDES) ACROSS THE LEFT LANE AND ONTO THE GRASSY SHOULDER.  DISCHARGE AND VENT VALVES WERE BROKEN OFF, CAUSING THE CONTENTS OF THE TRAILER TO BEGIN SPILLING OUT.  THE INJURED DRIVER CRAWLED OUT OF THE TRACTOR AND CALLED FOR EMERGENCY HELP USING THE CELLULAR PHONE OF AN ASSISTING MOTORIST STOPPED BEHIND HIM.  HE CALLED TO NOTIFY OUR NIGHT MANAGER, RICK MURPHY AT APPROXIMATELY 7:00 PM. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED QUICKLY AT THE SCENE AND WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES HAD SECURED THE LEAK.  APPROXIMATELY THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED GALLONS OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE (BLEACH) SPILLED ONTO THE GRASSY AREA BETWEEN 7:00 PM AND 7:15 PM TO 7:30 PM.  THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT NOTIFIED THE EPA AND DER RIGHT AWAY.  THE NIGHT MANAGER IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AN EMPTY TANKER AND TWO AVAILABLE EMPLOYEES TO THE SCENE AND CONTACTED UNIVERSAL WASTE AND TRANSIT TO HANDLE THE CLEAN-UP.  UPON ARRIVAL, THE SPILL WAS CONFIRMED AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND THE STATE WARNING POINT WERE NOTIFIED THERE FROM THE SCENE AT 8:37 PM.  THE REMAINING CONTENTS OF THE OVERTURNED TRAILER WERE PUMPED INTO THE DISPATCHED TRAILER.  THE TRAILER WAS HAULED BACK TO OUR PLANT LOCATION FOR STORAGE AND DAMAGE EVALUATION.  THE TRACTOR WAS RETURNED TO PENSKE TRUCK LEAKING IN TAMPA.  UNIVERSAL WASTE AND TRANSIT COMPLETED THE CLEAN-UP OF THE SPILL.  THE DRIVER WAS TAKEN TO A NEARBY HOSPITAL FOR EMERGENCY CARE.  THE AREA OF THE ACCIDENT IS CLASSIFIED AS A BUSINESS/SHOPPING AREA.  THERE WAS NO REPORTED EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUALS OR OTHER VEHICULAR OR PROPERTY DAMAGE AT THE SCENE.  AS THE CHEMICAL WAS IN LIQUID FORM, IT DID NOT POSE ANY THREAT OF POTENTIAL HEALTH RISK TO PERSONS OFFSITE EITHER.  IN SUMMARY, THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, COUNTY EMERGENCY MEDICAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESENTATIVES PROVIDED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE ON THE SCENE.

I ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY IGNITION SOURCES NEAR THE VICINITY OF THE LEAKING PACKAGE AND THIS WAS ACKNOWLEDGE WITH AN AFFIRMATIVE RESPONSE.  I THEN ADVISED THAT THIS SOURCE BE SHUT OFF TO ELIMINATE ANY CHANCE FOR A FIRE OR EXPLOSION.  I IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED A P/T SPILL TECHNICIAN TO THE AREA TO ASSESS THE SCENE AND DETERMINE WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE TO MITIGATE THE SITUATION.  UPON ARRIVAL, SPILL TECHNICIAN DON FLOREA ADVISED THAT THE PACKAGE CONTAINED TOLUENE, AND THAT VERY LITTLE APPEARED TO HAVE LEAKED FROM THE PACKAGE AT THIS TIME.  THE PACKAGE WAS QUICKLY PLACED IN TWO PLASTIC BAGS AND TRANSPORTED TO THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SORT FACILITY FOR CLOSER INSPECTION OF THE PACKAGE.  AGENT JOEL SCHAEFER OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINSTRATION OF THE COLUMBUS OHIO, CASFU OFFICE WAS HERE DOING SOME OTHER WORK AT THE TIME AND I ASKED IF HE WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PACKAGE WITH ME.  AT THIS TIME THE PACKAGE WAS OPENED IN AGENT SCHAEFER'S PRESENCE AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PACKAGE CONTAINED 2 x 1 QUART GLASS BOTTLES IN INDIVIDUAL INNER CARDBOARD BOXES, ONE OF WHICH WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED APPARENTLY DUE TO THE IMPACT IT HAD WITH THE CONCRETE FLOOR WHEN THE PACKAGE FELL OUT OF THE LOAD DEVICE TYPE CONTAINER.  THE PACKAGE WAS PROPERLY MARKED, LABELED, CERTIFIED, AND APPEARED FROM THE OUTSIDE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS, TITLE 49.  THE PACKAGE HAD AMPLE ABSORBENT AND CUSHIONING MATERIAL (VERMICULITE), BUT WHAT IS BELIEVED TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO WHY ONE OF THE INNER GLASS BOTTLES BREAKING WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE IMPROPERLY PLACED INSIDE OF THE PACKAGE.  I.E. THE INNER CARDBOARD BOXES, DIMS APPROX. 3 1/2"" x 3 1/2"" x 8"" WERE SET INTO THE OUTER PACKAGE FLAT ON THE BOTTOM AND FLAT AGAINST THE INNER MOST SIDE OF THE PACKAGE, THUS NOT ALLOWING THE VERMICULITE TO SEPERATE THESE INNER MOST PACKAGES FROM THE OUTER PACKING.  IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST 1"" - 1 1/2"" OF ROOM FOR THE VERMICULITE TO BE PLACED UNDER THE INNER PACKAGE AND THE BOTTOM OF THE OUTER PACKAGE AS WELL ON THE SIDES.  THE PACKAGE AS STATED EARLIER DID HAVE ALL THE PROPER INNER, OUTER MATERIALS, BUT WHAT ATTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF ONE, OF THE INNER GLASS BOTTLES WAS HOW IT WAS PLACED INSIDE THE PACKAGE PRIOR TO SHIPPING.  AGENT JOEL SCHAEFER, WHILE VISUALLY INSPECTING THIS SHIPMENT, TOOK PICTURES OF BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER PACKAGING PRIOR TO AND AFTER OENING THE SHIPMENT TO AS CERTAIN WHAT MAY HAVE ATTRIBUTED TO THE LEAK AFTER FALLING APPROXIMATELY FOUR FEET ONTO A FLAT CONCRETE SURFACE.
