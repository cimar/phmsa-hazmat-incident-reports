I, John Vergis Environmental Officer for the WLE, was called to investigate this leak.  When I looked at the car, I noticed that the valve was leaking through the valve plug.  I checked to see if the valve  handle was loose and it was.  I tightened the valve handle and the leak stopped.  I checked the valve  plug to see if it was tight and it was.  It needed new thread tape.  The plug was bottomed out in the valve.  The FRA Inspector removed original seal named TARGA from the protective housing lid.   They installed seal number DOT FRA 52040.  I removed this seal to make a repair and then installed seal number 971763.  I then returned the car to service.

According to the caller, approximately 2-gallons of UN2794 ""Batteries, wet, filled"", 8 released to a trailer floor (465-6002) from (2) 1,500-lb. metal containers due to being tipped over when it arrived at the customer's facility at 647 Summers Street in Boston, MA. The caller indicated the release was contained to the trailer floor. Due to the incident occurring at the customer location and not at the terminal, ERTS dispatched Clean Harbors out of Boston, MA with an unknown ETA at this time. Clean Harbors could not respond to the spill response, therefore, Moran Environmental was notified. Moran Environmental, Global Remediation nor New England Disposal Technologies could respond to the spill due to teams being out from the office. ERTS notified Environmental Restoration who indicated they will let ERTS know if they can clean the release. Environmental Restoration indicated they did not have personnel to clean the release. Allstate Power-Vac was notified of the release, and provided an ETA of 1700 to clean the release. ERTS notified DEP on-site, initial caller and driver of the ETA. There were no drains or waterways reported to have been impacted by the release. The Massachusetts DEP was notified, however, due to the release not meeting MASS DEP limits, the release is not reportable. The local fire department was also made aware of the release and is responding to the incident. There is a DOT 5800 required for this release due to its size.

The Veolia driver continued to their next stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. Along the way,  the driver had to make a quick and hard turning maneuver to avoid a fire truck in downtown,  Manchester. The driver was concerned about the tote of material after the maneuver and pulled over  to check the tote. Upon opening the back door of the truck, a small amount of liquid came out of the  back of the truck. The driver then moved the truck to a flat area as they were on a slight incline. The  driver then called the Veolia home office to report the spill and request assistance. The driver also  walked the area from discovery of the spill to the area of the maneuver and saw a small amount of  liquid on the street. The leaked material did not get on any third party vehicles and did not enter any  storm drains. Duration of the release was about two minutes. Less than 3 gallons of material was  released to the outside of the vehicle. This was cleaned up by Veolia employees or evaporated prior to cleanup. About 32 gallons of leaked material remained within the vehicle. The 32 estimated gallons  that came out of container that did not escape the vehicle was cleaned up by in-house Veolia  employees. Approximately half of the free liquids released from the tote was absorbed by cardboard  that was in the vehicle. Additionally about 10-15 gallons of liquid was in the back of the truck that  needed to be collected and cleaned up. Location of the tear on the IBC was about three quarters of  the way up the side of the tote. The tote was extremely old and had not been filled completely. The  offeror told Veolia employees that it had taken them a long time to fill it to the point it was and that  they did not want to continue filling the container. Upon inspection it was discovered that the side  walls of the container were extremely pliable and had evidence of degrading. The tear appears to  have been caused by the degraded plastic contacting the surrounding metal cage of the tote during the vehicle's swift maneuver while in transit.  Once the shipment arrived at the Veolia facility, the  remaining material was transferred into an appropriate UN specification IBC prior to continuing  transport to the disposal facility.",The primary cause of the leak appears to be the age of the container that was used. The tear in the  container occurred during an emergency maneuver around a fire truck in a downtown location. The  driver did a good job checking the load after the maneuver and we will stress this procedure with other  drivers. In the future we will also inquire about the age of containers when we obtain  information from the offeror that it has taken some time to fill a container.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The driver immediately donned the proper personal protective equipment, applied absorbent material to stop any further spillage, and notified facility personnel and local dispatch. A third party subcontracted response crew responded to the scene, donned the proper PPE and remediated the impacted areas of the trailer and ground below the trailer. The waste generated during the cleanup process was properly containerized for future disposal. The rear hatch of the trailer was properly tightened and the tanker was put back into service.","Prior to the time the tanker was loaded for transportation, no evidence of leaking or damage was observed. An investigation into the root cause determined that one bolt on the rear hatch of the trailer was loose after the trailer went for a certified wash out at a wash facility. To mitigate future occurrences, management has implemented and trained drivers on a checklist which is to be used after receiving any tank trailer from a wash facility, and before the trailer is dispatched on any subsequent trips.

There was no inner packaging, the contents were placed directly into a plastic pail and shipped as such. The inspectors estimated that approximately a quart of the liquid contents had leaked out, however it is impossible to estimate a duration of release.

When the driver hit the ice, the trailer started sliding to the left following the grade of the bridge. Driver tried to gain control, but lost control, causing rollover and fire. Trailer sustained heavy damage, but is impossible to determined what exactly failed because of the extensive damage and total loss as a result of the fire.  The duration of the release was less than 1 hour, as the product burned. Because of the position on the bridge, the product that escaped through the bridge drains went one direction, and product that ran down the side of the roadway went another, causing cleanup in two different storm drainage areas.  Fire crews responded and put the fire out, then environmental crews hired by Associated Petroleum cleaned up the remaining contamination. Testing was conducted to see if there was any effects on local soil and groundwater from the product and firefighting foam used in the incident. Results haven't been completed to this date.","This event should not have occurred. Roadways were dry and the driver had no reason to expect ice on the bridge. There was a large snowbank on the upper side of the roadway that should have been cleared away after a snowstorm that move through 3 days earlier. There should be a standard created where DOT agencies, while clearing snow, move the snow and ice to the low side of the bridge instead of cutting a path through it for traffic to pass. It is our opinion that this accident was completely avoidable by clearing the snow to the low side so that when it melts, it goes into the drain instead of across the road only to re-freeze at night.",Yes,,PORTABLE TANK,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,153000,"ASSOCIATED PETROLEUM CARRIERS, INC.",US,

Based off hazardous marking on packaging PPE was obtained and package was placed in a lined tote. PH strips were used to determine the nature of wet areas of package. PH strip confirmed the package was in fact soaked from an internal leak and acidic in nature showing a PH of 0 on the color scale. An SDS was obtained. As a basic precaution Amphomag was spread over the package and are in which it was found. Based on preliminary investigation the spill appears to have been contained in the fiberboard of the packaging.The main cause of the leak is believed to have been caused by loose caps and degraded inner seals.

It had 500 in it.  He had 597 gallons to offload and it wouldn't all fit.  Our stance is to offload to the 90% mark.  He called in for his safety check call and the caller told him to offload 315 gallons and shut down.  Because of the little amount it would only take 1-2 minutes to offload that amount but because it was flammable he would have to use his pump.  He advised he didn't feel safe doing this due to the short duration and trying to figure out how to clear his lines afterwards.  He was asked to do it anyways and after a few minutes the tank started overflowing.,The driver should have refused to unload at this point since he already wasn't feeling comfortable. In addition those who do the checklists with the driver were coached on this as well.

The damaged was incurred as a result of a broken drawbar from a car that was three cars ahead of this car.  The debris from the drawbar failure tore the bottom door.  Furnace ash was spread over approximately 1/4 mile of track as the train was coming to a stop.  Responders assessed the site and a tackifier was applied over the heaviest concentrations of dust to prevent further dispersion by wind.  A vacuum truck was utilized to removed impacted ballast and remaining dust on the track bed.  The damaged car was moved to Cutbank, MT for repair of the door and balancing of the load with lime.  Once balanced, the car continued in transportation to the consignee.

On December 19, 2018 the Tradebe Transportation, LLC driver inadvertently hooked up to the wrong 40-foot dump trailer. The trailer was transported to Covanta, a non-hazardous disposal facility in Huntsville, Alabama and dumped. Covanta personnel removed the material from the disposal pit and staged on a concrete/asphalt floor at the facility.  On December 19 at approximately 11 :30AM Tradebe notified Covanta that the trailer we were delivering to their location was not the correct trailer and that it had hazardous waste on it. We inquired if the load had been delivered yet and were told that it had. We requested that they identify the materials location and immediately isolate the load as it had hazardous waste in it. Tradebe then notified its driver to turn around and head back to Covanta so Tradebe could retrieve the material delivered. Tradebe immediately began searching for a response group to assist in retrieval of the material and found Environmental Products & Services of Vermont, Inc. (EPSVT). They were dispatched to assist in retrieving, reloading, and transporting the material back to Tradebe in Millington, TN. The removal of material began on 12/20 and ended on 12/21 with all roll-off boxes removed from Covanta by 12/23. In all, ten (10) 25 cubic yard roll-off bins for disposal were transported back to Tradebe.  Tradebe prefers to identify this shipment as an event, rather than an incident due to the fact that material was never ""released!' in an uncontrolled fashion. Material was always under the control of knowledgeable personnel and inside facility structures designed for handling such materials.","Although the delivery was accidental, Tradebe has identified several corrective actions to prevent a recurrence. Corrective actions already put in-place include:  1.) Require probation drivers (<90 days OT J) to only pick up trailers during normal dispatch business hours (days). 2.) Require probation drivers to confirm all load related information through the dispatcher before leaving with the load.  3.) Send daily e-mails to site supervisors detailing loads leaving during off-hours.  4.)
