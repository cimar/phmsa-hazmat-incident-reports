THE PRODUCT TRANSFER LINES HAD BEEN CONNECTED BETWEEN THE TRANSPORT AND THE STATIONARY EQUIPMENT AS THE FILL STATION BY THE UNLOADER AND OFF LOADING WAS PROGRESSING WITHOUT INCIDENT.  AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES OF PUMPING AND AS THE DRIVER WAS WALKING WITHOUT INCIDENT. AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES OF PUMPING ND AS THE DRIVER WAS WALKING AWAY FROM THE TRANSPORT, HE HEARD A POP, TURNED TO SEE AND EXPANDING VAPOR CLOUD AND HEARD THE TRACTOR ENGINE SPEED UP.  HE RETURNED TO THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE TRUCK TRACTOR JUST AS THE HYDROCARBON IGNITED.  THE UNLOADER WAS UNABLE TO ESCAPE THE ENSUING FIRE, WHICH WAS CENTER AROUND THE MID SECTION OF THE TANKER TRANSPORT IN THE VICINITY OF THE TRANSFER PUMP AND VALVE MANIFOLD ARRANGEMENT ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TANKER.  BASED ON AN INSPECTION OF THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AT THE ACCIDENT SCENE AND OTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO DATE, IT IS OUR OPINION THAT THE HYDROCARBON RELEASE RESULTED FROM A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED MATERIAL FAILURE OF THE SHORT BYPASS HOSE BETWEEN THE TRANSFER PUMP AND THE EXTERNAL BYPASS VALVE (SEE ATTACHMENT B) LOCATED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE TRANSPORT TANK.  THE HOSE WAS APPROXIMATELY 1-1/4 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESSURIZED DURING THE PUMPING OPERATION TO OFF LOAD PRODUCT.  WHILE THE BYPASS HOSE WS MOSTLY CONSUMED IN THE ENSUING FIRE, THERE WAS A VARIETY OF EVIDENCE THAT INDICATED THE BYPASS HOSE WAS THE MOST LIKELY SOURCE OF THE HYDROCARBON RELEASE AND ELIMINATED OTHER EQUIPMENT AS THE SOURCE, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: 1. EVIDENCE OF A SUDDEN ND SIGNIFICANT RELEASE OF HYDROCARBON WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE RUPTURE OF A PRESSURIZED HOSE, NOT A LEAKING GASKET, PUMP SEAL OR VALVE PACKING.  NO RUPTURES WERE FOUND IN ANY RIGID PIPING, VALVES OR TANK NOZZLES WHICH COULD EXPLAIN THE SUDDEN HYDROCARBON RELEASE.  2. THE ACCIDENT SCENE, INCLUDING THE FIRE PATTERN, INDICATED THAT THE HYDROCARBON RELEASE WAS IN THE VICINITY OF THE BYPASS HOSE.  3.  THE FIRE, WHICH PERSISTED FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTER IGNITION, WAS FED BY HYDROCARBON ESCAPING FROM UNDER THE MID SECTION OF THE TRANSPORT TRAILER CONSISTENT WITH THE LOCATION OF THE BYPASS HOSE.  TO PREVENT RECURRENCE OF THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF INCIDENT MARTIN TRANSPORT INC AUDITED OUR MC331 FLEET AND REMOVED THIS TYPE OF SECONDARY BYPASS (ONLY 4 UNITS REQUIRED THIS ACTION).",,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,173489,"Martin Transport, Inc.",US,

ON 10/23/2000 AT 0025 AN ODOR WAS REPORTED IN BUILDING 207 OF OUR SORT FACILITY LOCATED AT ABX AIR INC., 145 HUNTER DRIVE, Wilmington, OHIO 45177.  PART TIME HAZMAT TECHNICIAN DONALD OSBORNE AND WILLIAM HENDERSON DONNED PROPER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND RESPONDED.  UPON ARRIVAL THEY FOUND A BLUE PLASTIC DRUM THAT HAD VISIBLE SIGNS OF LEAKAGE FROM THE CLOSURE.  THEY REMOVED THIS PACKAGE FROM THE AREA AND BEGAN THEIR INVESTIGATION.  UPON THIS INVESTIGATION THEY NOTICED THAT THE PLASTIC SCREW TYPE CLOSURE WAS LOOSE, CAUSING LEAKAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 3 OUNCES.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PLASTIC RING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLOSURE HAD COME LOOSE FROM THE CAP.  THE CAP DID NOT HAVE A RUBBER SEAL ON THE INSIDE.  THIS RING IS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WOULD FIND AT THE BOTTOM CAP OF A SODA POP BOTTLE.  THIS SHIPMENT DID NOT CONTAIN ABSORBENT MATERIAL.  THEY PLACED THE DRUM INTO 2 PLASTIC BAGS WITH ABSORBENT MATERIAL.  THEY PLACED THE BAGGED SHIPMENT INTO A RECOVERY DRUM AND RETURNED IT TO ALDRICH CHEMICAL COMPANY.  THE LEAKAGE WAS CONTAINED IN THE ""BLISTER PACK"" THAT THE HAZMAT PAPERWORK WAS INSIDE OF.  THE AREA INVOLVED WITH THE ODOR WAS WELL VENTILATED BEFORE NORMAL WORK OPERATIONS WERE RESUMED.  THERE WAS ONE EMPLOYEE IN CONTACT WITH THE ODOR, SHE WAS ADVISED WHAT IT WAS AND RETURNED TO HER WORK AREA.  NO MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS NEEDED, NO CHANGES WITH THIS EMPLOYEE.  NO FOLLOW UP NEEDED.

PART TIME HAZMAT TECHNICIAN PAUL SCHMIDT AND CECILLE HICKEY DONNED PROPER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND RESPONDED.  UPON ARRIVAL THEY FOUND A BROWN FIBERBOARD BOX THAT WAS SUSPECTED TO EMITTING AN ODOR.  THEY REMOVED THIS PACKAGE FROM THE AREA AND BEGAN THEIR INSPECTION.  UPON THIS INVESTIGATION THEY FOUND 3 INNER FIBERBOARD BOXES MARKED ""THIS SIDE UP"" ON THE TOP.  THEY TOOK ONE OF THESE BOXES OUT AND OPENED IT. THEY FOUND IT TO CONTAIN 2  X 1 L PLASTIC COATED GLASS BOTTLES.  ONE OF THESE BOTTLES WAS BROKEN AT THE BOTTOM, LEAKING A MINIMAL AMOUNT OF GASOLINE FROM THE BROKEN AREA.  THEY OPENED THE REMAINING TWO BOXES AND FOUND THEM TO CONTAIN THE SAME AS THE FIRST.  ALL OF THE INNER BOXES DID NOT CONTAIN ABSORBENT MATERIAL, NOR DID THE OUTER BOX.  THEY REPLACED THE ITEMS BACK INTO THEIR BOXES, RESEALED THEM, AND PLACED THEM EACH INTO 2 PLASTIC BAGS WITH ABSORBENT MATERIAL. THEY PLACED THE BAGGED SHIPMENTS INTO A RECOVERY DRUM.  THE RECOVERY DRUM WAS FORWARDED ONTO IT'S DESTINATION.  THERE WAS ONE EMPLOYEE IN CONTACT WITH THE ODOR.  HE WAS ADVISED WHAT IT WAS, AND RETURNED TO HIS WORK AREA.  NO MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS NEEDED, NO CHANGES WITH THE EMPLOYEE.  NO FOLLOW UP NEEDED.
