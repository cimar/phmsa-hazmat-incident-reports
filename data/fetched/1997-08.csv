DURING THE COURSE OF THIS TRIP, THE DRIVER MADE A ROUTINE STOP AT 200 WEST OHIO AVENUE, DOVER, OH TO PICK UP A SHIPMENT FROM ANOTHER GENERATOR.  UPON OPENING THE REAR DOOR TO THE TRAILER, THE DRIVER NOTICED A LEAKING CONTAINER AND A PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR OF THE VAN TRAILER.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY PLACED SORBENT MATERIAL ON THE FLOOR OF THE VEHICLE TO CONTAIN THE RELEASE AND PREVENT AN ESCAPE  TO THE ENVIRONMENT.  THE DRIVER CONTACTED HIS SUPERVISOR AND A CLEAN-UP CREW WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SITE.  UPON THE CREW'S ARRIVAL,  A CLEANUP WAS INITIATED.  ALL SPILLED MATERIAL AND CLEANUP DEBRIS WAS PLACED INTO A SUITABLE DRUM FOR DISPOSAL.  THE DAMAGED CONTAINER WAS ALSO PLACED INTO A SUITABLE SALVAGE DRUM.  BOTH DRUMS OF MATERIAL WERE SHIPPED TO THE DESTINATION FACILITY NOTED ON THE ORIGINAL HAZARDOUS WASTE MANIFEST.  AN INSPECTION OF THE INCIDENT REVEALED THE CAUSE OF THE DAMAGE TO THE CONTAINER TO BE A LOOSE PIECE OF UNSECURED EQUIPMENT.  A FLEXIBLE BUNGY CORD WAS EMPLOYED TO SECURE THE DRUM CART TO THE WALL OF THE VEHICLE DURING TRANSPORTATION.  THIS BUNGY CORD BROKE AND ALLOWED THE DRUM CART TO SLIDE FREE.  THE DRUM CART SLID INTO A DRUM, CONSEQUENTLY PUNCTURING THE WALL OF THE CONTAINER.  PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FROM THE SHIPPERS LOCATION, THE DRIVER SECURED THE DRUM CART TO THE WALL OF THE VEHICLE.  AT THE TIME, THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THE BUNGY CORD WOULD FAIL.
