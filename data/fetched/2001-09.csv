MY FIRST STOP WAS IN LANCASTER, PA WHERE I LOADED MANNHEIM SCHOOL DISTRICT (SEE ATTACHED MANIFEST), FIVE PIECES VARIOUS HAZARD CLASSES.  MY SECOND STOP WAS SYNTHES, USA, IN WEST CHESTER, PA WHERE I LOADED SEVEN DRUMS OF CLASS 8 AND THREE NON-HAZARDOUS DRUMS.  MY THIRD STOP WAS CHESTER COUNTY FURNITURE REFINISHING ALSO LOCATED IN WEST CHESTER, PA ABOUT 2 MILES AWAY WHERE I LOADED ONE 30-GALLON DRUM OF CLASS 3 MATERIAL.  ALL CONTAINERS WERE INSPECTED PRIOR TO LOADING.  INSPECTION INCLUDED CONTAINER INTEGRITY, PROPER LABELS AND PROPER CLOSURES.  ALL DRUMS WERE ACCEPTABLE AT TIME OF LOADING.  AFTER LOADING THESE THREE STOPS, I WAS PROCEEDING TO MY FINAL DESTINATION, EEI IN ROYERSFORD, PA WHERE I WAS TO DELIVER THE SEVEN DRUMS FROM SYNTHES.  AT APPROXIMATELY 13:15 I STOPPED TO FUEL MY VEHICLE AT DELCHESTER OIL 304 TURNER ROAD WEST CHESTER PA.  DURING FUELING OPERATIONS, I COMPLETED A BASIC WALK AROUND INSPECTION OF MY TRUCK.  EVERYTHING APPEARED TO BE IN ORDER.  WHILE SECURING THE CAP ON MY FUEL TANK I HEARD A ""POPPING"" AND ""HISSING"".  I BACKED AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE TO VISUALLY INSPECT AGAIN.  WITHIN 3-4 SECONDS OF THE SOUND LIQUID STARTED LEAKING OUT OF BOTH FRONT CORNERS OF THE CARGO PORTION OF THE VEHICLE.  THE MATERIAL HAD AN ACIDIC SMELL.  I IMMEDIATELY ENTERED THE CAB OF THE TRUCK TO SECURE MY MANIFESTS, CELL PHONE AND CONTINGENCY PLAN.  I THEY FOLLOWED THE FOLLOWING STEPS:  1- MADE SURE THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. THERE WAS NO ONE. 2- VISUALLY OBSERVE THE SPILL AREA LOOKING FOR DRAINS, WATERWAYS OR OTHER SENSITIVE AREA.  NONE EXISTED.  3- CALLED 911 AND NOTIFIED THE DISPATCHER THAT THERE WAS A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS EMERGENCY.  4- CALLED HAZMAT ONE TO NOTIFY THEM AND HAVE THEM DISPATCH OUR EMERGENCY CONTRACTOR.  5- NOTIFIED THE EMPLOYEES OF DELCHESTER OIL OF THE EMERGENCY. 6- ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY THE MATERIAL.  VISUALLY AND WITH PAPERWORK REVIEW. 7- ASSISTED RESPONDING PERSONNEL AS REQUESTED.  8- CONTACTED MARK WEBER. FIRST TO RESPOND TO THE SCENE WAS CORPORAL HOLLAND OF THE WEST GOSHER TWP. POLICE AND A LOCAL EMT TEAM.  UPON CONTACT WITH CORPORAL HOLLAND WE NOTICED SMALL RELEASE OF YELLOW/GREEN VAPOR WAS BEING RELEASED FROM THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.  THE ROAD WAS CLOSED AND THE SCENE WAS ISOLATED.  NEXT TO RESPOND WAS TOM GLASS AND THE CHESTER COUNTY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE TEAM AS WELL AS LOCAL FIRE PERSONNEL.  THE CHESTER COUNTY TEAM SET UP A DECONTAMINATION UNIT AND PREPARED TO ENTER THE HOT ZONE AND EVALUATE THE MATERIAL AND THE TRUCK.  I PROVIDED A DIAGRAM OF THE INSIDE OF THE CARGO PORTION OF THE TRUCK INCLUDING LOCATIONS OF ALL DRUMS AND THEIR CORRESPONDING HAZARD CLASSES.  I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THE MATERIAL WAS NITRIC ACID.  THE CHESTER COUNTY HAZ MAT TEAM WORE OSHA LEVEL A PPE, ENTERED THE HOT ZONE, EVALUATED THE SCENE, VERIFIED IT WAS AN ACID WITH A PH TEST STRIP.

ALL LANES OF THE INTERSTATE WERE CLOSED DOWN TO ALLOW FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO EXTINGUISH FIRE. ARRIVED ON SCENE TO FIND THAT THE TANKER WAS FULLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES. SPOKE WITH FIRE DEPARTMENT AND WERE INFORMED THAT THE STORM DRAINS WERE FULL OF FUEL. FLAMES WERE SHOOTING FROM THE STORM DRAINS. FIRE HAD ALSO SPREAD TO THE WOODED AREAS NEAR THE SITE. AS THE FIRES WERE EXTINGUISHED CREWS INSPECTED THE DRAINS FOR FUEL. STORM DRAINS WERE PACKED WITH OIL DRY TO ABSORB FREE LIQUIDS AND RESTRICT FLOW OF CONTAMINATED WATER THROUGH THE DRAINS. TWO BIRMS WERE BUILT TO FURTHER RESTRICT FLOW OF CONTAMINATED WATER. INSPECTED THE SADDLE TANK ON THE TRACTOR (ONLY ONE WAS ON THE TRACTOR) A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF FUEL WAS FOUND. A SPLIT AT THE CREASE APPROXIMATELY 1/4""3"" ALLOWED MOST OF THE FUEL TO LEAK OUT. A PATCH KIT WAS USED TO PREVENT FURTHER SPILLAGE AS THE TRACTOR WAS MOVED. DIESEL FUEL AND GASOLINE WERE DETECTED IN AN AREA APPROXIMATELY 45'LONG BY 5' WIDE ON THE EAST BOUND SHOULDER. AFTER THE TRACTOR WAS MOVED S & W WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THE DRAIN PLUG AND CAPTURE APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL. AFTER THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED CREWS WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THE LOWER END OF THE STORM DRAIN AND PLACE BOOMS AT THE STORM DRAIN. WEST BOUND TRAFFIC LANES WERE LITTERED WITH FIRE DEBRIS (CONCRETE, GRASS, SOD, ETC. ) FOR APPROXIMATELY 200'. LANES WERE SWEPT IN ORDER TO ALLOW TRAFFIC TO FLOW. CONTACTED LARRY ROBERTSON WITH DEP. MR. ROBERTSON ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND WALKED THE ENTIRE AREA. HE SAID TO NOT FLUSH THE DRAINS WITH WATER. DEP PREFERS TO ALLOW THE NATURAL FLOW OF RAIN WATER TO NATURALLY REMEDIATE AREAS SUCH AS THIS. BOOMS WILL BE LEFT AT THE LOWER END OF THE STORM DRAIN AND MONITORED REGULARLY. S & W SPOKE WITH MR. ARCHIE WOOD WITH WENDELL WHO THEN GAVE A VERBAL OK TO CONTINUE WITH THE CLEANUP ALREADY IN PLACE. SPOKE WITH BILL DORSEY WITH S & T CLAIMS WHO ALSO AGREED THAT S & W SHOULD PROCEED WITH THE CLEANUP. TANKER REMAINS AND OTHER LARGE PIECES OF DEBRIS WERE REMOVED FROM THE MEDIAN. APPROXIMATELY 5 TONS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS REMOVED FROM THE EAST BOUND SHOULDER. FURTHER EXCAVATION IN THIS AREA MAY BE NEEDED AT A FUTURE DATE DUE TO GASOLINE STILL BEING DETECTED. CREWS BEGAN REMOVING CONTAMINATED SOIL FROM THE MEDIAN. REMOVED APPROXIMATELY 15 TONS OF SOIL FROM THIS AREA AT A DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 3"" TO 10"" IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEDIAN AND HIGH LEVELS OF GAS WERE STILL BEING DETECTED. RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM MR. JAMES SHANNON TO TEMPORARILY STORE SOIL AT THE BEAVER-GRADVIEW VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT. TWO WENDELL TRANSPORT REPRESENTATIVES ON SITE AGREED THAT THE LEVELS WERE EXTREMELY HIGH. SMALL TEST HOLES WERE DUG TO AN ADDITIONAL 8"" AND FREE LIQUIDS WERE STILL BEING NOTED. NOTIFIED MR. DORSEY WITH S & T CLAIMS THAT LARGE AMOUNTS OF SOIL WOULD NEED TO BE REMOVED FROM THIS SITE. MR.

UPON COMPLETION OF LOADING, THE DRIVER WEIGHED HIS VEHICLE AND LOAD AT THE US STEEL TRUCK SCALE AND FOUND THAT HE WAS ABOVE HIS LEGAL WEIGHT LIMIT FOR THE PUBLIC ROADS. TO REDUCE THE WEIGHT OF HIS LOAD, THE DRIVER MOVED HIS VEHICLE TO AN OFFLOADING STATION. ONCE AT THE OFFLOADING STATION, THE DRIVER CONNECTED ONE END OF A FLEXIBLE HOSE TO A DRAINAGE VALVE ON HIS TRUCK. AFTER ATTACHING THE FLEXIBLE HOSE TO HIS TRUCK, THE DRIVER OPENED THE TRUCK'S DRAINAGE VALVE. THE OTHER END OF THE FLEXIBLE HOSE WAS CONNECTED TO AN OFFLOADING STANDPIPE. THE DRIVER DID NOT PHYSICALLY CHECK THE STANDPIPE CONNECTION PRIOR TO OPENING THE TRUCK'S DISCHARGE VALVE.  A POOR CONNECTION AT THE STANDPIPE RESULTED IN A SPILL OF APPROXIMATELY 20 GALLONS OF FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION ONTO THE GROUND SURROUNDING THE STANDPIPE. THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED PLANT PROTECTION. PLANT PROTECTION FORCES ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AND APPLIED CAUSTIC TO NEUTRALIZE THE ACID. THE POOLED RESIDUAL MATERIAL ALONG WITH STAINED SOIL AND ROCKS WERE PROMPTLY RECOVERED AND PROPERLY DISPOSED. TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING AGAIN, THE UNLOADING PROCEDURE FOR OVERWEIGHT VEHICLES HAD BEEN CHANGED IN EVENT THAT A DRIVER OVERFILLS HIS TRUCK, HE MUST NOW OFFLOAD HIS TRUCK AT THE FRESH ACID STORAGE FACILITY. THIS FRESH ACID STORAGE FACILITY HAS CONTAINMENT TO PREVENT THE RELEASE OF FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION IN THE EVENT OF A SPILL. THE ISSUE OF THE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANIFEST REQUIRES SOME CLARIFICATION. AT THE IRVIN PLANT, THE FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION FROM THE CARBON STEEL PICKLING OPERATIONS IS TRANSPORTED TO THE AMROX REGENERATION FACILITY IN ALLENPORT, PENNSYLVANIA. AT THIS AMROX REGENERATION FACILITY, THE FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION IS CONVERTED INTO 18% HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND IRON FINES. THE IRON FINES ARE SOLD AS A RAW MATERIAL TO VARIOUS MANUFACTURES WHILE THE HYDROCHLORIC ACID IS RETURNED BACK TO THE IRVIN PLANT FOR USE IN THE PICKLING. SINCE THE FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION GENERATED AT THE IRVIN PLANT IS USED AS A RAW MATERIAL FEEDSTOCK TO THE AMROX FACILITY, THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA DEFINES THIS MATERIAL AS A  CO-PRODUCT AND  DOES NOT CONSIDER IT AS A WASTE. AS SUCH, THERE IS NO HAZARDOUS WASTE MANIFEST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHIPMENT IN QUESTION. IF THE FERROUS CHLORIDE SOLUTION IS SPILT, AS IT WAS ON THIS OCCASION, THE SPILT MATERIAL IS TREATED AS A HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE MATERIALS RECOVERED DURING CLEANUP WERE DISPOSED AS HAZARDOUS WASTE.",,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,310,,US,

IT APPEARED THAT THE SPILLED GASOLINE HAD MIGRATED DURING RAINFALL OVER AN AREA ADJACENT TO THE ABOVEGROUND STORAGE TANK (AST) THAT WAS RECEIVING THE DELIVERY TO A STORM DRAIN CATCH BASIN THAT IS PART OF THE FACILITY DRAIN SYSTEM THAT DISCHARGES INTO A LARGE RETENTION POND PRIOR TO THE ELIZABETH RIVER.  SORBENT MATERIALS HAD BEEN PLACED AROUND THE CATCH BASIN BY NORFOLK SOUTHERN CORP. AND DOMESTIC INDUSTRIES PERSONNEL WHICH REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF GASOLINE THAT ENTERED THE CATCH BASIN.  THE RETENTION POND WAS CHECKED FOR ANY EVIDENCE OF GASOLINE CONTAMINATION AND NONE WAS FOUND.  THE NEXT CATCH BASIN DOWNSTREAM FROM THE IMPACTED BASIN WAS OPENED AND A SORBENT BOOM WAS DEPLOYED TO CONTAIN ALL CONTAMINATION BETWEEN THE TWO (2) CATCH BASINS.  A PCRS VACUUM TRUCK WAS SET UP TO RECOVER FREE PRODUCT (GASOLINE) AND CONTAMINATED WATER FROM THE SECOND CATCH BASIN WHILE THE PIPING WAS FLUSHED WITH WATER FROM A NFD ENGINE COMPANY.  ADDITIONAL PCRS PERSONNEL RECOVERED ALL FREE STANDING PRODUCT ON THE GROUND AROUND THE AST WITH SORBENT MATERIALS.  A TOTAL OF 544 GALLONS OF GASOLINE CONTAMINATED WATER AND THREE (3) 55 GALLON DRUMS OF CONTAMINATED SORBENT MATERIALS WERE RECOVERED FOR PROCESSING AND PROPER DISPOSAL.  THE SORBENT BOOM IN THE SECOND CATCH BASIN AND THE SORBENT BOOMS SURROUNDING THE FIRST CATCH BASIN WERE LEFT IN PLACE AS A PRECAUTION UNTIL CONTAMINATED SOIL/STONE REMOVAL ACTIVITIES COULD BE SCHEDULED.  ON 9/21/01, PCRS PERSONNEL EXCAVATED 10.91 TONS OF GASOLINE CONTAMINATED SOILS AND STONE FROM AREA ADJACENT TO THE AST TO A MAXIMUM DEPTH OF 4"" BELOW GROUND SURFACE FOR THERMAL RECLAMATION AT SOILEX CORP. LOCATED IN VIRGINIA BEACH, VA. FIELD READINGS OBTAINED WITH A PHOTOIONIZATION DETECTOR (PID) SHOWED REMAINING HYDROCARBON LEVELS RANGING FROM 0.1-1.6 PARTS PER MILLION (PPM). BASED ON THESE READINGS AND NO EVIDENCE OF ADDITIONAL SUBSURFACE FREE PRODUCT CONTAMINATION, ALL IMPACTED AREAS WERE BACKFILLED TO GRADE WITH CLEAN #57 STONE FURNISHED ON SITE.  ALL REMAINING SORBENT MATERIALS (1 DRUM) WERE REMOVED AND TRANSPORTED TO PCRS FACILITY FOR PROPER DISPOSAL. 11.

AT THE INTERSECTION OF 3RD AND CENTER STREET MR. MADKINS WAS FORCED TO QUICKLY BRAKE HIS TRUCK DUE TO A SUDDEN LIGHT CHANGE AT THE INTERSECTION. WHEN MR. MADKINS BRAKED, THE LIQUID IN HIS TANKER SURGED TO THE NOSE OF THE TANKER AND SLOSHED BACK ALONG THE TOP. THE TANKER MR. MADKINS WAS PULLING HAS TWO 3-INCH PORTS ON THE DOME THAT WERE COVERED AND LOCKED USING A  CAM-LOCK FITTING. THE FORCE OF THE LIQUID HITTING ONE OF THE COVERS CAUSED THE CAM-LOCK TO FAIL, ALLOWING APPROXIMATELY TWO GALLONS OF WASTE MATERIAL TO SPEW OUT. DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE PORT ON THE TOP CENTER DOME OF THE TANKER, AND HIS ATTENTION TO TRAFFIC CONDITIONS, MR. MADKINS DID NOT SEE THE MATERIAL COME OUT OF THE TANKER, SO, AFTER STOPPING FOR THE LIGHT, HE PROCEEDED TO HIS DESTINATION. HOWEVER, AN OFF DUTY FIREMAN WHO WAS ALSO AT THE INTERSECTION, DID SEE THE MATERIAL COME OUT, AND REPORTED THE SPILL TO THE HANNIBAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.  DAVID HYMERS WITH THE HANNIBAL FIRE DEPARTMENT CONTACTED CONTINENTAL CEMENT AT APPROXIMATELY 11:30 AM AND INFORMED THEM OF THE INCIDENT. SARAH HOFFMAN AND JEFF HEIBEL FROM CONTINENTAL WENT TO THE SCENE.
