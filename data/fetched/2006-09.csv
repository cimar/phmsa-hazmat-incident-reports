Prior to arrival at the facility, the driver stopped on Jefferson Street immediately to the west of the facility in order to obtain parking/unloading instructions.  Upon return to the vehicle, the driver noticed a small leak from the trailer.  After further investigation, Veolia facility personnel determined a pole mount transformer being transported had tipped over inside the trailer.  At this time Veolia site personnel immediately began to contain the spill and stop the leak.      Upon entering the trailer it was confirmed that one pole mount transformer with a capacity of 15 gallons and a PCB concentration of 240 ppm PCB oil had tipped over in the trailer.  The transformer was placed in an upright position and the spill was contained.  Oil that had dripped out of the trailer as well as any areas on the ground where the oil had leaked were cleaned up by double washing/rinsing with kerosene/diesel/soap and water.      After the spill was contained, the trailer was parked at the loading dock and the material was removed from the trailer.  The trailer floor was then decontaminated using the same procedure of double wash/double rinse of the affected area.  The spill event lasted approximately 15 minutes and was cleaned up done immediately.    Veolia estimates that no more than 10 gallons of oil were spilled but the generator states maximum oil in unit to be 15 gallons of oil.  The driver was disciplined for failure to properly secure the shipment.","Ensure that any container being transported is suitable for highway transportation.  Lids must be secure, the material must be secured to pallet and load locks, straps or braces must be used inside the trailer to prevent the material from shifting or tipping over.  Transformers are top heavy and must be secured to prevent this event from happening.  Veolia trains drivers in the safe transportation of hazardous materials and reviews every incident and shares the investigation results with the drivers.  A special bulletin will be provided to the drivers reminding them of proper cargo securement responsibilities and procedures.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Veolia ES Technical Solutions LLC,US,

At the time of the release the vehicle was entering the off-loading pad at the storage area of Pike Industries in South Portland, ME.  While driving up an incline to the off-loading area, the driver noticed oil coming out the drain tubes in the back of the trailer.  He immediately stopped the vehicle, and proceeded to the back of the trailer.  Upon arriving at the back of the trailer he noticed oil seeping out of the middle dome cover.  The driver decided to move the trailer to a level ground to prevent any additional material leaking out.      The driver then notified his dispatch of the incident, applied available spill control material to the spill and awaited the arrival of the clean up crew.   Concurrently, the supervisor notified Maine Department of Environmental Protection via phone of the incident and a representative arrive on the scene around 3:30pm.    We estimate that approximately 30 gallons of fuel oil leaked out onto the secondary containment.  An in-house response crew conducted a thorough spill clean up operation, placed all contaminated materials into appropriate containers for disposal at a fully permitted waste management facility.  The remainder of the material was offloaded from the tanker into a storage tank and the tanker truck was placed out of service until the cause of the leak could be determined and repaired.      Our initial investigation found that one of the dome cover vents was out of adjustments and had failed to perform as designed.","  In response to this event, the vehicle in question was placed out of service and taken to a repair shop for maintenance.  The man-ways will be checked for tolerances and all necessary adjustments will be made.      Additionally, the tanker will not be loaded with greater than 8,000 gallons of material and at temperature not greater than 140 degrees Fahrenheit.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,570,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc",US,

An associate of the carrier questioned the documentation for the shipment and asked the customer specifically if the cargo was hazardous.  The customer indicated that it was hazardous but is no longer hazardous once unloaded from the original container.  The associate copied me in on the e-mail inquiry of the customer.  I asked the customer to provide the regulatory reference showing that the shipment is non hazardous.  He did not immediately answer so I phoned the customer to discuss the issue with him.  He still indicated that the shipment was non hazardous.  I, knowing differently, asked his to chat with the hazmat help desk with the DOT.  The help desk associate confirmed our understanding of the shipment of two containers.  The customer then provided all of the required hazardous materials documentation for the shipment which was already in transit via rail to the ocean terminal for loading aboard our cargo vessel.  Instructions were given to hold the shipments to to apply the class 9 marking with the UN number.",This problem was caught by one of our trained hazmat associates at the marine terminal.

Because of the distance and elevation that the product had to travel, driver couldn't clear the lines so he used some air pressure.  He stated he relieved the pressure before disconnecting the hose from the trailer but it appears that there was probably still a little pressure in the line that caused some product to be squirted on his clothes when he disconnected.  He didn't notice it because his clothes were wet from perspiration.  When driver departed from the facility, he rolled up his shirt sleeves and noticed a burning sensation on the inside joint of his arm. He showered when he got back to our facility and then again when he got home. He treated the irritation with ointment for 3 days before reporting the incident to us.  We sent him to the clinic to be checked out.  An ointment was prescribed and driver was released to full duty with no lost time.","The prescribed PPE for corrosive products includes chemical suit, face shield, goggles, gloves, etc.  The driver was not wearing the correct PPE.

When he placed the forkblades through the proper opening in the pallet he went about halfwalf into the pallet when he observed liquid coming from that area. He immediately stopped and looked to investigate the cause. Here the pallet that was used by the shipper to stage the jerricans on was a poor grade pallet and just could not support the weight of them. As a result the center slats of the pallet caused the pallet to collapse in the middle causing the jerricans to sink downward into the path of the oncoming forkblades. The spilled material was cleaned with sorbent material and placed into a recovery container along with the damaged jerricans.

The trailer was loaded in West Burlington, Iowa and brought to Camanche, IA for later movement to Arlington, Heights, IL.  The power unit was unhooked from the trailer.  The trailer was dollied down onto a concrete dolly pad.  The dolly pad was approximately 160 feet long, 4 feet wide, 10 inches thick and in 8 foot sections.  Approximately one hour after the trailer had been unhooked/parked, the President of the Company was in the equipment yard and noticed that the trailer had started a slow roll to the trailer's left side.  The trailer rolled approximately 270 degrees clockwise (looking at the front of the trailer)and settled back to approximately 220 degrees from being up right.  The leak from the cargo tank started from around the Dome Cover.  No other leaks.  The leak of Ethanol lasted approximately 2 hours.  The Camanche, Iowa Fore Department and Police Department were notified and were on the scene in a matter of minutes of being notified.

The container had blocking & bracing but our broker advised that it was rejected by BNSF in CA because they determined the loading did not meet standards for intermodal rail transit. The drayage company, CALKO Transport performed the services to inspect,block & brace, and reseal for transit.     When it arrived at Intransit's rail ramp /yard, in Worcester, MA, it was removed from rail & transfered to a chassis, a leak was noticed from the container. The spill is resin based so the solvent based resin dried on the floor with the solvents quickly evaporating.     Intransit placed calls to our company & notified CHEMTREC. The MA DEP & Worcester Fire Department were called to the Intransit's site. We authorized our emergency repsonse contractor, Clean Harbors to respond, clean-up the spill, and handle resulting disposal.      It was dtermined that the spill was caused by a puncture to one drum from a protruding nail from adjacent wood bracing at the front nose of the container. It was evident that the nail rubbed /vibrated around the side of the drum before it became a punctured. We are addressing this issue with CALKO TRANSPORT in Compton CA.",We have requested CALKO investigate their blocking & bracing procedures and areas identify areas for improvement.

The force of the pressure release resulted in the top portion of the drum being torn of and partial forced ejection of the drum’s contents. Please note that at the time of the incident the container was located in a fully contained section of a concrete floor warehouse at Clean Harbors in-transit storage facility located at 2858 Route 322, Bridgeport, NJ. A facility employee was working in the warehouse at that time and upon hearing the noise associated with the rupture of the container, immediately evacuated the area and contacted the facility’s Emergency Response Coordinator (ERC).  The surrounding area was secured with caution tape and orange cones pending the arrival of appropriate emergency response personnel. An in-house emergency response crew arrived to the warehouse within minutes to assess the situation. Utili:ing appropriate personal protection equipment, and company health and safety procedures, the emergency response personnol entered the warehouse in order to identify the material involved. Upon reviewing the material markings and labels, it was determine I that the material involved was a shipment of hazardous Waste flammable liquid, n.o.s. (methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate 3, UN 1993, PGII picked up from Keystone Industries on 09/13/06 on EPA hazardous waste manifest 000686252FLE. It was also determined that out of 14 drums shipped only one had undergone rupture and release. The liquid methacrylate monomer had polymeriz d causing the drum to over pressurize and rupture. The resulting release scattered the reacted material throughout a large section of the warehouse. Some of the material hit the ceiling of the warehouse knocking down insulation and lodging in the ceiling 1-beams. All of the released material was contained within the warehouse and the threat of release to the environment was not present. The ERC retrieved the appropriate shipping papers and notified the shipper of the incident and asked for guidance. No immediate clean up action was taken due to concern for the remaining 13 drums undergoing a similar reaction.  See additional sheet for continuation.","Immediately following this incident, the approval to ship the waste stream involved in this incident was suspended pending an investigation conducted by the shipper of the material.    In order to prevent a recurrence of such incident, the shipper of this material has been asked to review their internal operating procedures to ensure the safety and stability of this waste stream. Further shipments of this material may resume, pending the outcome of Keystone Industry’s internal investigation and findings.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,1,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,20500,CLEAN HARBORS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES,US,

Upon observing the overflow, the truck driver / unloading operator immediately secured the transfer evolution.  The acid overflowed for approximately 30 seconds.  Prior to unloading the plant operator verified that there was adaquate room for the load of acid.  The recieving tank is approximately 6000 gallons. The initial tank volume was 2368 gallons before initiating the unloading evolution.  The tank overflowed with the guage reading 4924 gallons.  The tank level/volume instrumentation appears to be out of calibration and reading incorrectly.  About 60 gallons was spilled into the containment areas beneath the tank.  The spilled acid was neutralized and flushed with fresh water to the plant's waste system for treatment by plant personnel.  No offsite release occurred and no personnel were injured.","The Unit 5 acid tank level/volume instrumentation will be evaluated.  The instrument will be repaired or replaced, calibrated, and verified to operate correctly.  Meanwhile, instructions were made for plant operators to order acid at an indicated tank level of 2000 gallons verses 3000 gallons so that adaquate tank freeboard will be available.  The practice of ordering acid is normally done at 2000 gallons indicated tank level.  This practice was altered during hurricane season to order acid at 3000 gallons based upon lessons learned during Hurricane Katrina.",No,TANK,Steel,51,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Entergy - Ninemile Point,US,

The cause of this derailment was a stiff truck bolster which contributed to improper swiveling on the first railcar derailing. One of the derailed tank cars, DOWX 40077, on its side released product. The A-end tank head of DOWX 40077 sustained a head puncture approximately sized at 6 inches by 12 inches at the 7 o’clock position, caused by contact with other derailing rail equipment, most likely a coupler head. This puncture hole was facing towards the ground over a cement culvert for a drainage ditch which ran perpendicular to the main track. Escaping product flowed into this ditch and the responding local F.D. dammed the ditch, limiting the flow impact of the escaping product. Contract responders vacuumed all free standing product in the ditch. Hydrochloric acid was applied to the impacted soil in the ditch to neutralize PH levels and all impacted soil was excavated and profiled for appropriate disposal at an approved landfill. The remaining product in DOWX 40077 was vacuumed out; and afterwards, DOWX 40077 was cleaned and purged. An evacuation was initiated that impacted approximately 350 people for about 3 hours.",NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.,Yes,TANK CAR,,211AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,420000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

(Torrance, CA) as priority mail, via the U.S. Postal Service.  The airbags were shipped to American Honda by State Farm Insurance Companies (Charlottesville, VA)in a card board box sealed with packaging tape.      It appears the box was originally used by American Honda to ship replacement airbags to a repair facility.  The box was a certified, one-time use box, appropriately sealed and labeled.  At some point, however, it appears the same box was shipped to State Farm, via Fed Ex (a partial Fed Ex sticker is visible on the box).  State Farm in turn, shipped the box with the airbags to American Honda.         Upon receipt of the box, American Honda discovered the airbags were not deployed, and were in fact improperly packed.  The exterior of the box did not contain any handling instructions, nor did it have the required explosives placard.  Once the contents were known, American Honda was concerned for the safety of its employees.  We were also concerned that the Postal Service employees and others who handled the box, had no knowledge of the hazardous nature of the contents.  Fortunately, the airbags did not deploy and there were no injuries or property damage.       Photographs of the box and contents are available for your review.

While traveling on Highway 389 in Wagener, South Carolina, the Bridge Terminal Transport, Inc. vehicle was involved in a vehicle accident, which caused the truck to rollover.  Aiken County Sheriff's Department responded to assess the site.  Arch Wood Protection, the shipper, was contacted by the Aiken County Sheriff's Department to coordinate cleanup.  Hepaco, Inc. of Charlotte, North Carolina was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, Hepaco, Inc. contained the free product, and inspected the freight.  Five (5) 55-gallon drums had released their contents, and the remaining drums had been dented and damaged, however, remained in tact.  Approximately 275 gallons of free product were released to the roadway, and within the roadside ditch along the Interstate.  Hepaco, Inc. performed the cleanup at the direction of Arch Wood Protection, which was overseen by the South Carolina Department of Transportation, and South Carolina DHEC.  Contaminated soil has been excavated, and site has been restored to preexisting condition.  Hepaco, Inc. coordinated disposal of all waste generated during the cleanup directly with Arch Wood Protection.  Soil was transported for disposal on 11/20/2006.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.    Please note, due to a contract directly through Arch Wood Protection and Hepaco, Inc., no information was released to the carrier prior to November 21, 2006.  Bridge Terminal Transport, Inc. is aware of the deadlines set forth by the USDOT pertaining to completion of a DOT 5800.1 Form.

Approximately two minutes prior, the SUV crashed into the guard rail causing catastrophic damage to the vehicle (dislodged the engine and transmission from vehicle). Due to the time of incident, the transportation unit did not see the SUV until it was too late to avoid the collision. The transportation unit impacted the SUV sending the transportation unit into the guard rail; it then traveled onto the concrete barrier of the overpass and across the westbound lanes of the Interstate. The unit then overturned and rested in the medium between the east and westbound lanes of Interstate I-10. Due to the impact and resulting collision with the guardrail and concrete barrier, the tanker and tank received impacts crushing the tank. Fuel leaked from the tank and the dome lids of the tanker unit. Impacted areas were the soil surfaces of the medium.  As of November 15, 2006, on site remediation efforts are continuing to remove contaminants from the medium area.","The Arizona Highway Patrol Report Number 2006-049709 stated that due to the time, 0300 hours, and the darkness of the area, the driver would not have had the ability to see the SUV in a timeframe suitable to prevent the collision. The SUV was of dark color, had no running lights and received catastrophic damage, prior to the Flying J Transportation unit colliding with it.

While crossing the lanes the light turned amber and a tractor trailer jumped the light and struck the tanker broadside in the rear tires, causing the tanker to roll one and a half times. During the rollover the probe holder in the manhole was knocked out opening a two-inch hole in the manhole cover. The compartment was full and the truck on its side caused the fuel to spill out of the opening. Due to the accident 911 was called and the Port Authority police, Elizabeth Fire, Union County Hazmat, NJ DEP, US Coast Guard, Port Authority Environmental and Staten Island towing were called to scene. These agencies initially boomed waterway around airport with hard boom. A wooden peg was placed in the two-inch opening to slow fuel down. Approximately twenty minutes into the incident, Taylor Oil Co. was called. Taylor Oil called HMHTTC Response and Bull Dog Towing as well as internal company Hazmat and managerial response. Taylor Oil Co engaged in a two week clean up with HMHTTC, DEP and Port Authority Environmental to totally mitigate the incident. The spill and leak could have been minimized if the public agencies would actually use the equipment they have rather than wait for private contractors to do the work.","Part VII— Recommendations/Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence  Specific to the accident site, the duration of the traffic light changing from amber to red needs to be longer. There are six lanes to travel across at the intersection. Overall ways to improve transportation would be to stop granting CDL licenses to individuals who cannot speak or read the English Language.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,121100,TAYLOR OIL CO,US,

The vehicle slowed and traveled along the guardrail and when it came to a stop the shoulder gave away causing the truck to tumble down an embankment. The truck tank suffered a small puncture from the boulders that it came to rest upon. Reinhard Petroleum was immediately notified and in route to the scene within minutes. While in route Oregon Emergency hotline was contacted, the emergency hotline, and Environmental companies were dispatched to assist with the emergency response effort. Fire and aid arrived immediately to the scene prevent further spillage and medi-vac the driver to Portland for medical attention.   Approximately 801 gallons of jet fuel was released into the ground. No waterways were compromised by the release and environmental clean-up was successful.","Unfortunately no recommendations can be made to prevent an accident of this nature.

William Corrigan, Transfill Technician, had just entered the fill area to assist Howard (Burchard) with closing the valves on the M6 cylinders that had just completed the fill process. About half way through the first rack, as he was closing the valve on a cylinder, he stated that “it blew up”. The cylinder flew through the air and hit the fence, fell to the floor and started spinning around and then disappeared. (NOTE: The cylinder impacted the chain link fence separating the fill area from the walk way and warehouse about 15’ from the floor and was found to have come to rest in the cylinder prep area next to the fill area.) The valve was found to have separated from the cylinder and was still attached to the quick connect and pigtail.    Howard Burchard, Senior Transfill Technician, had just finished the filling process on 4 racks of M6 cylinders, most of which were new and being filled for the first time. As he started closing the valves Corrigan came into the fill area and started closing the valves on the racks on the other side of the line. Suddenly he heard an explosion, something hit the fence and then he observed a cylinder spinning and bouncing around on the floor, finally spinning out the opening in the fence into the cylinder prep area. At that time he ran to the control panel and started venting off the pressure in the lines. The end result was the loss of the 5.8 cubic foot of oxygen, compressed that was in the failed cylinder and the amount (unknown) of oxygen that was in the piping.    The damaged cylinder was quarantined. The rest of the cylinders that were part of the same shipment were blow down, removed from the racks and placed back in the box they had been received in and placed in quarantine.    There were no injuries or collateral damages as a result of this incident.","The failed cylinder and valve were sent to the Pacific Metallurgical Company, 2828 South Robertson Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90034 for examination. The report of the finding by Shahram Sheybany, Ph.D. has been forwarded to Luxfer and to Wayne Chaney, U.S. DOT, PHMSA    The incident was reported to the manufacture, Luxfer, who has initiated an investigation of their processes in an attempt to identify the cause of the accident.",No,CYLINDER,Seamless cylinder made of definitely prescribed aluminum alloys,3AL,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"APRIA HEALTHCARE, INC",US,

Car had been pulled form the shipper’s facility the previous evening. CSX Transportation dispatched Young’s Environmental Cleanup, Inc., Flint, MI. Young’s Environmental Cleanup personnel advised at 0926 hour, 09/07/2006 that they noted a vapor leak at the “A” end liquid line valve. Leak was due to valve not being fully seated and its plug being less than tool tight. Young’s Environmental Cleanup personnel reseated the valve and leak stopped. They secured this fitting and the vapor line valve plug also was less than tool tight, but was not leaking. Shipper representative, Mike Sheaffer, on scene, advised CSX Transportation that he would conduct a safety review of this incident with his personnel that afternoon (09/07/2006).

The accident impacted a 20 foot by 3 foot area of impervious asphalt roadway and an 80 foot by 10 foot area of soft, sandy shoulder. The majority of the impacted area was comprised of packaging debris from the cargo on this load. The liquid spills resulted from the impact of the 5 galLon containers that were ejected from the load out onto the pavement. The material was determined to have been released from the caps on top of the container. The spills themselves were restricted to several 1  foot square areas.    All the spill areas were neutralized with soda ash. The soft shoulder was hand excavated where warranted. All the contaminated soils and absorbent were drummed for disposal.
