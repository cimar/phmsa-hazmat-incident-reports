Hepaco LLC, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the vapors were being released from the manway and residue product on the side of the tank car. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Tom Davidson at 404-376-9550. Contractor personnel found that 1 of 8 manway swing bolts not applied.  Manway was opened to inspect the gasket, after manway was opened no manway gasket was present.  A new manway gasket was installed.  Manway was closed and manway swing bolts were properly tool tightened.  Residue product on side of tank car was cleaned up and waste was containerized for disposal. The leak was secured and the car released for transport.

Millrock Drive, Suite 150",Salt Lake City,UT,84121,Shipper,"The covered hopper railcar was transported by the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) from Cheyenne, WY to Battle Mountain, NV.  Between 12/20/2021 and 12/21/2021 it was loaded with 219,600 lbs. of ammonium nitrate fertilizer (AN) and had a gross weight of 282,600 lbs. The railcar was inspected and the bottom gate was locked. The railcar departed Cheyenne on 12/27/2021 and was delivered to the Battle Mountain, NV site on 1/7/2022. The car remained at the Dyno Nobel rail siting until 1/10/2022, when it was moved to the rail scale. Employees noted a gross weight of 206,800 lbs. and observed the B side compartment was empty and the bottom end gate was open approximately ½-inch.  All of the seals were in place and unbroken. The employees inspected the tracks where the car sat between 1/7/2022 and 1/10/2022 and did not observe AN on or around the tracks.    The car traveled through WY, UT, and NV over an 11 day period and made stops in each State.  During transit, it appears the bottom end gate opened 1/2-inch spilling AN, which dispersed along the route within the railroad tracks until the compartment was empty.  It appears the bottom end gate lock failed to maintain the gate in the secured position.  Dyno Nobel is working with the UPRR to share information.  UPRR ordered their employees to inspect sites where the railcar was stopped and to look for signs of AN accumulation along the rail line between Cheyenne, WY and Battle Mountain, NV.  Dyno Nobel and UPRR have been providing information to the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection, the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, and the Federal Railroad Administration.  If an accumulation is located, Dyno Nobel will coordinate with UPRR to clean up the spill.    Dyno Nobel interviewed the railcar loaders and track crew, and reviewed hopper the car inspection checklist with those employees.",no comments provided,Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,9930,Dyno Nobel Inc.,US,

The car was isolated and NGL Supply Terminal CO LLC, NYS DEC and NRC were notified.  (CHEMTREC 2022-01-24-00234. CSX Hazmat Manager D. Scoons, Responded to the scene along with personnel from HEPACO and found the tank car was leaking from the protective housing area.

The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper John Houser 518-378-9794. H/M Scoons closed the liquid line valve and tightened the secondary plug. The leak was secured and the car was released to transportation.

Driver shut down procedure and placed a bucket underneath QRB then drained enough product to unhook three 20' hoses from Cargo tank to customer tank. After unhooking, driver walked over to what he thought was a containment drain and dumped approximately 4 gallons of product in drain. Moments later, driver started draining transfer hoses into drain totaling approximately 6 gallons into drain before plant personnel told him to stop because the drain was not containment, but a storm drain that lead to a fresh water source. Upon further investigation,  it was discovered that the main drain valve to main hole that leads to fresh water source was closed, therefore, product was not released into fresh water supply. Additionally, it was discovered that the QRB clamp did not fail, simply not properly tightened.  Plant personnel & driver began cleaning up spill, but the decision was latter made to call in a 3rd party environmental crew to clean up approximately 200' of drain line leading to main release valve.","Driver has been retrained on stop work authority and the proper procedures for handling spill/issues at customer locations.

He was preparing to making load spent 50% Sodium Hydroxide at the Kaiser Aluminum facility, which would be transported for beneficial reuse at the US Ecology North Facility in Detroit. The customer procedures stated the hose was not to be charged until the driver made a connection to the truck and gave a signal that he was ready. The process takes two employees from the customer site – (1) in the basement to start the pump, and (2), another at the main floor level to communicate with the driver and open the valve. After investigation, the valve was found to be partially opened, and the pumps were started prematurely. Material was pushed through the line to the truck. Material sprayed the USE Taylor driver, hitting his face, getting in his mouth and on his clothes. The driver was not wearing his proper PPE (face shield & chemical suit) yet at the time of this incident. The US Ecology driver received assistance from the customer site, flushing with water for approximately 15 minutes. The driver contacted US Ecology Health and Safety who intern consulted with an on-call medical service. The driver was able to leave the customer site and return to Taylor without further care or treatment","US Ecology Taylor EHS conducted an investigation of the events. Kaiser Aluminum was contacted and participated by providing and discussing the protocols for loading trucks at their facility. It was determined that the protocols were not not followed by the employees, i.e., the valve at the fill connection was not checked, and PPE protection was not in place. It was agreed that training will be conducted and reviewed on the filling process to ensure these protocols are followed. Additionally, Kaiser Aluminum will not start the pumps or open any valves until the driver has indicated that he has made the proper connections. The process has been reversed connecting the hose to the truck prior to connecting the hose to the plant source.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"US Ecology Transportation Solutions, Inc.",US,

The spilled material was removed from the trailer and the leaking container was overpacked into another CleanPak XL. Upon inspection and investigation, it was determined that the likely cause of the release was a puncture from a pallet nail.","After a thorough internal investigation, Ingenium's Corrective Action Team issued the following corrective action in order to prevent a recurrence: The site's Location Manager conducted a complete review of pallet inspection procedures with Ingenium- Kent's staff.
