The caller stated that the released product was contained to the dock floor at door #16 and requested a contractor out to clean and contain the spill, and to transfer the un-impacted product into a new tote. ERTS dispatched GrayMar to conduct cleanup activities. At 1230 EST, GrayMar personnel arrived onsite and confirmed 1 gallon of product released to the asphalt parking lot in a 6' x 6' area due to a wooden piece of the pallet puncturing the tote. The material was transferred into a new tote. Absorbents were worked into the impacted areas and collected.

The car was isolated and Solvay  Chemical, KDEP, and National Response Center were notified CHEMTREC Report #2021-09-14-00258.  SPSI, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the faulty pressure relief  device. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Cindy Shirley and  618-215-7151. Contractor personnel replaced the pressure relief vent and were unable to get the car  to pass a bubble leak test. Once the car was above 5 PSI a small leak was detected coming around  the rupture disk. The car was depressurized and is currently awaiting to be clean and purged, so it can  move on an OTMA. It was determined that the lining in the car is preventing the PRV from sealing  correctly.

The car was isolated and (Marathon Petroleum  Company, KDEP and Nation Response Center were notified (CHEMTREC Report #20210917-00315.  Quick Response, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a liquid leak  coming from the liquid line flange connection to the fittings plate. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Mike Murray-606-921-6255. Contractor personnel vented the pressure off the car and secure the car for a mobile repair unit top inspect the flange/valve.  The impaction to the car evaporated and did not require further decontamination. On 9/20/2021 Specialized Professional Services inspected the flange/ valve and found that the flange bolts were  torqued to <50ft lbs. The normal torque spec for these flanges bolts is 150ft lbs. After the  flange/valve was torque to the proper spec, the car was pressured to 35 psi with nitrogen. There  were no leaks detected by SPSI once the flange/valve was torqued to the proper spec. The car is  currently awaiting an OTMA-1 to return to Marathon to be bubble leak tested.

NS Hazmat and Hepaco, a response contractor, responded to investigate and repair the car.  The manway bolts were found to be tool tight but there were signs of leakage around manway.  Manway was opened and the manway lid gasket was not properly seated in the grooved portion of the lid as designed.  Approximately 80% of the gasket was not seated in the manway lid and was hanging down into the car.  The gasket showed signs of being folded and torn.  A replacement lid gasket was not available therefore a manway nozzle gasket was installed to seal the manway.  The manway was secured and tool tightened.

He then asked for assistance from the Veolia, Schenectady, NY facility to overpack the 30 gallon drum.  Once the container was overpacked, the employee then brought it to the Stericycle, Oneonta, NY facility so it could be offloaded there and then sent for proper disposal in Rhode Island. The Veolia employee investigated the source of the leak but could not figure out what caused the leak without opening the container. It is assumed that the liner inside the fiber drum was defective or damaged and allowed liquid to dampen the fiber drum. It is estimated that less than 2 ounces of liquid leaked into the box van. No liquid made it outside of the box van. The drum was overpacked and the liquid on the truck floor was cleaned up.",The Veolia employee investigated the source of the leak but could not figure out what caused the leak without opening the container. It is assumed that the liner inside the fiber drum was defective or damaged and allowed liquid to dampen the fiber drum. The package is better than what is typically used for medical waste.

The driver, who was not injured, was told by another driver who was following him, that 911 had been called. He then assessed the situation and called our company to notify us. I then called the wrecker/recovery service, the remediation/cleanup company, and then the National Response Center (NRC) to advise of the situation in the event of a possible spill. There was no package failure that resulted in a spill. Approximately 20 to 30 gallons was released through the pressure release system during the 2 hours and 30 minutes the unit was on it's side against the bank, until being placed back on it's wheels by the wrecker service. There was no structural or valve failures. Plugs made from rags were placed into the relief tube to stop the venting of product. The spillage was contained in the ditch by pads and dirt. Thankfully, the tank, the dome lid area, and the offload valve were not damaged.","The berm of the roadway and weather conditions were a contributing factor to the cause of this incident. All drivers/employees have been notified as a refresher, to use extreme caution during these conditions, or anytime they travel any roadway. Especially with winter conditions soon to arrive. During these types of weather conditions, it is extremely important to reduce speed and use caution while keeping a safe distance from other vehicles. All drivers/employees were reminded to maintain respect for the transportation of a liquid product that is constantly moving. The tanker transporting the liquid asphalt was in very good condition and well maintained. This contributed to only a small amount of product being released through the pressure release venting tube. The detour route being used, due to the road closure of the main route being under construction, is not the best route of travel for Commercial Vehicles. Very few of our drivers use the designated detour route.",Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,48287,"Erie Enterprises, Inc",US,

The car was shoved out of the car shop, and a railroad qualified response contractor was mobilized to investigate. Upon arrival, the contractor donned appropriate PPE& SCBA, and ascended the tank car to perform an inspection of the valves inside the protective housing. ACFX 220428 was found with an audible gas leak Inside protective housing. The Inspection of the vapor line valve revealed that the valve wasn't properly closed, with a vapor pressure that could be felt with a glove hand coming from the top of vapor line dry lock secondary closure plug, emitting pass the cap. Responders tightened the vapor line valve to the fully closed position which stopped the vapor leak. The car was pressure tested at the sample port which revealed 84 psl. The sample port plug was relnstalled and rendered tool tight. Cable seals were applied to both liquid line& vapor line valve handles In a manner to prevent valves from Ioosenlng. Snoop was applied to all valves& leak points inside protective housing, with no additional leaks found. Because the dry lock secondary closure plug was defective, a new dry lock fitting was obtained and Installed prior to the car being released back Into transportation. File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at the tlme of filing. This shipment was offered as a'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered In this package Is not known to the carrier.

DANNY HANSEN,MANAGER TRUCK OPERATIONS,,,,,Carrier,Sinclair Truck was traveling west on I-95 when a passenger vehicle swerved to the left over two lanes of traffic and hit the right front tire of the Sinclair Vehicle. The force of the contact caused the Sinclair truck to turn to the left where the left front tire hit the center median and the truck was rolled on to its passenger side. The rollover caused a leak in the trailer which ended up releasing about 500 gallons of gasoline. The fire department responded initially and put cat litter in the road to dam up the small stream of gasoline so that the gasoline did not get into the storm drain system. Later the gasoline was pumped out of the tank trailer and the triler was turned upright and towed to a storage yard. The fuel spill was cleaned up by Clean Harbors with many bags of vermiculite and put into 55 gallon storage drums and taken away for disposal. Driver was not hurt.

The hole in the bladder was a 4"" cut along the middle of the plastic bladder. The liquid spilled onto the trailer floor, dock and dock apron for a short duration of time as the associates plugged the hole with some plastic material to slow the leak. At this point they were able to remove the IBC from the trailer and place it on the dock at an angle to stop the release. Once the leak was stopped they waited on the response team to arrive. The spilled liquid had leaked onto flat surfaces and was not spreading in any direction. Hazmat One was contacted around 18:37 to send a response team to mitigate the spill.

We are not sure why the driver drifted off the road. It could have been he was tired or was reaching for something in his Iunchbox in the passenger seat. Driver was not wearing seat belt and was ejected when the tractor flipped. The driver was found deceased at the scene and there was a""kitchen faucet"" drip from the washout cap for about 3 hours. The Gilford fire department hazmat team placed a raincoat underneath the drip and used absorbent pads while trying to figure out how to remove the product. Then Fulp's Environmental Cleanup arrived and immediately placed a Bett's valve over the washout cap which stopped the spill. The original BOL had 431801bs of isobutyl acetate and the recovered tanker had 430001bs, not more than 1801bs(180/7.2lbs/G=25G) spilled. Of note, all truck scales have a weight difference, I estimate the spill to be no more than 10 gallons in three hours based on a fast kitchen faucet leak of 15,140 drips per gallon which would make it over 45000 drips in one hour(see US government website: www.water. usgs.gov/edu/activity- drip.html). The driver diesel saddle tank leaked, unknown how much. Fulp's Environmental recovered the soil based upon a Certified Geologist on scene for any spilled diesel fuel and isobutyl acetate. Isobutyl acetate is not a listed waste and the recovered soil will NOT be hazardous waste because the soil will not meet the EPA definition of D001. The wreck occurred across the street from a residential neighborhood estimated to have about 50 people living there. When the leak was discovered they were evacuated for about an hour until the leak was contained with a Bett's valve. The tanker itself did not rupture or leak. It is only the dean-out cap that was Ieaking at a drip rate. Police and fire department reports are included","training of the fleet. He proceeded to develop a comprehensive Driver Safety Manual and driver safety training topics. We conduct a minimum 5-day new hire orientation trainin@ for each employee and it takes longer for the drivers to complete all the training. The driver Safety Manual is 209 pages and we train on each page. The drivers must initial and date each page that they have read and understand it as we go through the training. We already emphasize that the drivers are to follow the speed limit and to wear a seat belt anytime they are in a CMV. We also train on the the hours of service and they understand the maximum drive time is 11 hours in a 14 hour period. We have a specific presentation on this that indudes the updates to the regulation last year. We instituted a Safety Alert to which we train the employees on what happened, the potential root cause, and how to prevent a recurrence. We will continue to reinforce to the drivers NOT to be distracted when driving a CMV.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,358217,CHEMSOLV,US,
