THE DRIVER TRIED TO MAKE AN EVASIVE MOVE TO THE RIGHT LANE, WHILE ALSO APPLYING THE BRAKES VERY HARD, BUT WAS STRUCK IN THE LEFT FRONT OF HIS TRACTOR. THE IMPACT RIPPED THE LEFT FRONT SPRING HANGER OFF THE FRAME, SHIFTING THE AXLE TO THE REAR OF THE TRACTOR, WHICH CAUSED THE STEERING WHEEL TO TURN SHARP TO THE LEFT. THIS CAUSED THE TRACTOR STEERING WHEEL TO SPIN IN THE DRIVER'S HANDS. AT THIS POINT THE DRIVER HAD NO CONTROL OVER THE STEERING OF THE TRACTOR, THE CAR CONTINUED TO SPIN AND THEN HIT THE FRONT DRIVER AXLE ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. THE VEHICLES CAME TO REST ABOUT 40 FEET APART.

HE WAS STOPPED FOR 3-5 MINUTES WITH FOOT ON BRAKE PEDAL AND 4 WAY FLASHERS GOING. THERE WERE 3-4 CARS STOPPED IN FRONT OF HIM AND A ROAD CONSTRUCTION WORKER WITH A STOP SIGN HALTING EASTBOUND TRAFFIC. PETE WAS DRINKING COFFEE, WAITING FOR HIS LANE TO START MOVING, WHEN HE FELT A BANG AND  THE TRUCK JERK FORWARD. THE COFFEE CUP FLEW OUT OF HIS HANDS AND HE LOOKED AT THE CAR IN FRONT OF HIM. HIS TRUCK BUMPED THE CAR IN FRONT OF HIM (NO DAMAGE TO THE CAR). PETE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND ALL HE SAW WAS SMOKE/STEAM. HE COULDN'T TELL WHAT HIT HIM. HE SHUT OFF THE MOTOR AND PUT THE TRACTOR/TRAILER BRAKES ON AND JUMPED OUT OF THE TRUCK. PETE RAN TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE TRAILER AND SAW IT LEAKING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE UNLOADING VALVE, THEN RAN TO THE TRUCK THAT REAR-ENDED HIM. STEAM FROM THE RADIATOR ENGULFED THE TRACTOR; HE TRIED TO OPEN THE DRIVER DOOR BUT IT WAS JAMMED SHUT. THE DRIVER, FROM JET EXPRESS, HAD HIS WINDOW DOWN AND SAID HIS KNEE AND HEAD HURT AND HE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT PETE HAD STOPPED IN FRONT OF HIM. PETE ASKED IF ANYONE HAD CALLED FOR HELP AND WAS TOLD BY A MAN ON THE SCENE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION CREW HAD WALKIE TALKIE AND HAD CALLED FOR HELP. PETE WENT TO HIS TRUCK TO CALL PVS BUT HIS TRACTOR PHONE WAS DEAD. HE USED HIS PERSONAL CELLULAR AND NOTIFIED BOB PEPIN AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30 P.M. THAT HE HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN AND ACCIDENT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT FROM THE VILLAGE OF HOMER ARRIVED-- ASSISTANT FIRE CHIEF KURT SWOPE.

WHEN CARL AND AL ARRIVED, PETE AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DISCUSSED THE CLEAN UP PLAN WITH THEM. PVS PERSONNEL SUITED UP AND STARTED CLEANUP WITHIN 15 MINUTES OF ARRIVAL. PETE OPENED THE DOME TOP AFTER THE VAC WAS ALREADY RUNNING TO MINIMIZE THE SPILL. THE TRACTOR WAS VAC'D OUT FIRST, THEN THE SPILL ON THE GROUND. 3650  GALLONS WAS VAC'D INTO 26V, AND MANIFESTED FOR TRANSPORT TO DYNECLO FOR DISPOSAL. AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00 P.M., WHEN THE JET EXPRESS TRACTOR HAD BEEN DETACHED FROM THE PVS TRACTOR/TRAILER, CARL LEFT THE PETE FOR DYNECOL.

A DAL Ramp Agent discovered the material during the off loading of the flight.  Upon opening the bin of the aircraft, the Ramp Agent noticed the odor of Ether but could not identify a leaking bag or spill.  He called over a mechanic to verify the smell and then began checking baggage for the source.  It was determined that the lid of the ""Tupperware"" had come off in flight and the material was leaking.  The Ramp Agent notified his supervisor and was instructed to call the Dallas Police Dept. and Corporate Safety.  The DAL Station held the material and the FAA was notified the next morning.
