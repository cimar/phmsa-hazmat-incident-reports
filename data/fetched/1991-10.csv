DANNY PURVIS, WAS DISPATCHED TO AN ACCIDENT ON HIGHWAY 87 INVOLVING A GAS TRUCK AND ANOTHER VEHICLE.  UPON MY ARRIVAL, I OBSERVED AN INDUSTRIAL WELDING AND TOOL SUPPLIES TRUCK AND A TOYOTA 4 WHEEL DRIVE PICK UP.  BOTH VEHICLES WERE LAYING ON THEIR SIDES, WITH THE LIQUID NITROGEN TRUCK LAYING ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WITH DAMAGE TO THE PASSENGER SIDE, AND THE TOYOTA PICKUP LAYING ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WITH DAMAGE TO THE DRIVERS SIDE.  THERE WAS A SPRAY OF NITROGEN FUMES COMING FROM THE TRUCK AND DIESEL FUEL WAS LEAKING FROM THE MOTOR COMPARTMNET.  THE MONROE COUNTY E.M.S. DIRECTOR, MS. KAY GAY AND HER EMPLOYEES ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND STOPPED ALL TRAFFIC AND EVACUATED THE IMMEDIATE AREA, DUE TO THE FACT THAT SHE THOUGHT THERE WAS A HAZARDOUS SITUATION INVOLVED. AFTER TALKING WITH THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE #2, HE STATED THAT HE WAS HEADED NORTH ON HIGHWAY 87, TRAVELING AT APPROX. 40 M.P.H., WHEN A SMALL TRUCK CAME OUT INTO THE ROADWAY IN FRONT OF HIM.  THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE #2 STATED THAT HE SWERVED TO AVOID THE VEHICLE, BUT DID HIT IT A GLANCING BLOW, AND CONTINUED ON AND TURNED OVER IN THE DITCH.  THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE #2 SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES TO HIS RIGHT HAND AND WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE MONROE COUNTY HOSPITAL, WHERE HE WAS TREATED AND RELEASED.  THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE #1 STATED THAT HE WAS HEADING EAST ON TREY TERRACE, TRAVELING AT APPROX 25 M.P.H., AND WAS APPROACHING THE STOP SIGN AT THE INTERSECTION OF TREY TERRACE AND HIGHWAY 87.  THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE #1 STATED THAT AS HE APPROACHED THE STOP SIGN AND APPLIED THE BRAKES, THAT THE PEDDLE WENT TO THE FLOOR, AND WHEN HE PUMPED HIS BRAKES, THAT THEY WOULD NOT PUMP UP.  THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE #1 STATED THAT HE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A SHARP TURN TO THE RIGHT, BUT THAT HIS VEHICLE WENT INTO THE OPPOSITE LANE AND HE COULD NOT GET THE VEHICLE TO MAKE A COMPLETE TURN INTO HIS LANE.  THE DRIVER OR VEHICLE #1 STATED THAT THE TWO VEHICLES HIT A GLANCING BLOW AND THAT HE OVERTURNED IN THE HIGHWAY.  THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE #1 WAS NOT INJURED, BUT HE WAS CHARGED WITH FAILURE TO STOP AT A STOP SIGN, AND WAS ADVISED THAT IF HIS BRAKES ARE DISCOVERED TO BE DEFECTIVE, THAT HE CAN BE CHARGED WITH DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT.  AFTER TALKING WITH SEVERAL SUBJECTS ON THE SCENE, I LOCATED A WITNESS THAT GAVE BASICALLY THE SAME INFORMATION THAT THE TWO DRIVERS HAD GIVE.  THE WITNESS WHICH IS LISTED ABOVE, STATED THAT HE LOST CONTROL OF HIS VEHICLE, BUT THAT HE DID NOT STRIKE EITHER ONE OF THE TRUCKS, BUT DID RUN DOWN AN ENBANKMENT.  THE WITNESS STATED THAT AT THIS TIME, THAT HE RAN FROM HIS VEHICLE BACK TO THE OVERTURNED TRUCKS TO CHECK FOR INJURIES AND ASSIST THE DRIVERS IN GETTING OUT OF THEIR VEHICLES.
