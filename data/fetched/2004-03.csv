THE ROAD ELEVATION IS A GRADUAL DESCENT FROM THE EXIT RAMP OFF OF LOOP 289 FOR A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET TO THE STOP SIGN FOR ACCESS ROAD CROSS TRAFFIC.  ADJACENT TO THE STOP SIGN IS A CURVED RADIUS ALLOWING FOR A RIGHT TURN TO THE SOUTH BOUND ACCESS ROAD TO I-27.  IT WAS IN THIS TURN AREA THAT THE SPEED OF THE TRUCK CAUSED THE LOAD TO SHIFT TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE TURN, CAUSING THE RIGHT SIDE WHEELS TO LEAVE THE ROADWAY.  SCUFFING ON THE ROADWAY AND CURBING CONTAINED ALUMINUM MARKINGS WHERE THE ALUMINUM WHEELS RIMS AND THE SIDE OF THE TRAILER WERE ABRADED BY THE ROAD SURFACE. IT APPEARS THAT THE TRAILER OVERTURNED AS IT CAME OUT OF THE CURVE; FORWARD MOMENTUM WAS ARRESTED BY THE TOP PORTION OF THE TRUCK CAB STRIKING THE GUARD POSTS SUPPORTING THE LEFT SIDE GUARD RAIL.  THE TOP OF THE TRAILER, ON ITS' LEFT SIDE, CAME TO REST AGAINST THE ROADWAY OPENED SEVERAL SMALL HOLES IN THE SIDE OF THE TRAILER ALLOWING REGULAR UNLEADED GASOLINE TO LEAK OUT ONTO THE ROAD, THE ROADSIDE WHERE IN THE GUARD RAIL WAS SITUATED AND INTO A CONCRETE FLUME ADJACENT TO I-27 SOUTH BOUND.  THE TANK SIDE WALL WAS HOLED RATHER THAN SPLIT AND RUPTURED; HAD IT BEEN SPLIT OPEN, ALL OF THE PRODUCT WOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED AT ONCE.  AS IT WAS, THE LEAKAGE WAS SUSTAINED OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL HOURS.  WITNESSES CALLED 911 AND RESPONSE WAS VIRTUALLY IMMEDIATE.  CITY WORK CREWS WERE NEARBY AND WERE CALLED IN TO PLACE A DAM IN THE DRAINAGE FLUME TO PREVENT THE FLOW OF GASOLINE FROM ENTERING A NEARBY CREEK BED.  FIRE DEPARTMENT CREWS ATTEMPTED TO PLUG THE TRAILER HOLES THAT THEY COULD REACH AND WERE SOMEWHAT SUCCESSFUL.  WITH SEVERAL FIRE TRUCKS AND CREWS ON SITE, AND A FOAM TRUCK ON SITE, A LOCAL TERMINAL WAS CALLED IN TO ATTEMPT TO DRAFT PRODUCT OUT OF THE OVERTURNED TRAILER.  APPROXIMATELY 900 GALLONS WAS RECOVERED IN THIS ATTEMPT.  AS THE REQUEST THE FIRE CHIEF, A VACUUM TRUCK, OPERATED BY PATE TRUCKING OF LEVELLAND, WAS CALLED IN AND POSITIONED TO DRAFT GASOLINE AND WATER CONTAINED BEHIND THE DAM IN THE DRAINAGE FLUME. BOLER EQUIPMENT CO, OUR HAZMAT EMERGENCY RESPONDER, WAS CALLED IN AND WAS ON THE SCENE, WHEN WE ARRIVED FROM SAN ANGELO AT 12:25 PM.  THEY AND THE LUBBOCK FIRE DEPARTMENT WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN PREVENTING THE FURTHER ESCAPE OF GASOLINE INTO THE SURROUNDING AREA.  UPON ARRIVING ON SCENE, WE FOUND A DISCUSSION UNDERWAY AS TO SAFEST WAY TO UPRIGHT THE TRUCK AND TRAILER.  WE REQUESTED THAT BEFORE AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO UPRIGHT THE TRAILER, THAT THE TRAILER BELLY LINES ARE REMOVED AND THE BELLY FLANGES AND VALVES BE REMOVED IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE PRODUCT REMAINING ON BOARD.  WHEN THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED, FOAM WAS SPRAYED OVER THE AREA AND A TANKER UNIT WAS BACKED IN AND THE REMAINING PRODUCT WAS DRAFTED OUT OF THE FOUR COMPARTMENTS; AN ADDITIONAL 500 GALLONS WAS RECOVERED FOR A TOTAL OF 1400 GALLONS.

THE ACTUAL RELEASE WAS THE RESULT OF A TRANSFER HOSE FAILURE.  EMPLOYEES WORKING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE TRANSFER OPERATION WITNESSED THE RELEASE AND IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED HONEYWELL'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM FOR INITIATION OF TRANSFER TERMINATION AND REMEDIAL ACTIONS. OPERATIONS PERSONNEL QUICKLY TERMINATED THE TRANSFER AND RELEASE BY CLOSING THE ISOLATION VALVES AT THE RAILCAR AND PUMPING STATION.  IN ADDITION, HONEYWELL EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY CLOSED THE POSITIVE SHUT-OFF VALVE IN THE FACILITY'S SEWER SYSTEM, WHICH DISCHARGES TO LPDES PERMITTED OUTFALL 003. THIS ACTION RE-DIRECTED THE NORMAL OUTFALL 003 FLOW TO THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY AND PREVENTED ANY MATERIAL FROM ESCAPING THROUGH AN UNTREATED DIRECT DISCHARGE SYSTEM.  AS A RESULT, NO MATERIAL WAS RELEASED BEYOND THE FACILITY AND NO PH DEVIATIONS WERE RECORDED OUTSIDE THE NORMAL PERMITTED RANGE.  THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE SPILL EVENT IS ALMOST ENTIRELY PAVED WITH CONCRETE.  A SMALL SECTION OF SOIL HAVING A LIMESTONE COVERING WAS ALSO AFFECTED.  THE LIMESTONE PROVIDED SOME NEUTRALIZATION OF THE ACID MATERIAL, HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL MEASURES WERE IMPLEMENTED TO REMEDIATE THE SPILL SITE.  RESPONSE TEAM MEMBERS FLUSHED THE ENTIRE AREA AFFECTED BY THE SPILL WITH WATER SEVERAL TIMES.  THE COLLECTED WATER WAS THEN ROUTED TO HONEYWELL'S WASTEWATER TREATMENT UNIT FOR FURTHER NEUTRALIZATION AND PROCESSING.  BETWEEN FLUSHES, HONEYWELL TESTED THE PH OF THE EXPOSED SURFACE AREA OF SOIL USING PH PAPER UNTIL APPROXIMATE NEUTRAL PH WAS ACHIEVED.  NOTIFICATION TO THE STATE POLICE EMERGENCY HOT LINE OF THE INCIDENT WAS IMMEDIATELY PROVIDED AT APPROXIMATELY 1730 HOURS, WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY A NOTIFICATION TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) (REPORT#715665).  THE ESTIMATED ON-SITE SPILL QUANTITY OF 2,550 LBS IS BASED UPON INVENTORY MASS BALANCING.  BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT, THE RELEASE OF SULFURIC ACID DID NOT ESCAPE BEYOND THE SITE OF THE FACILITY AND COULD NOT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO HAVE ESCAPED BEYOND THE SITE OF THE FACILITY. NEVERTHELESS, OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION AND AS A MATTER OF POLICY, HONEYWELL IMMEDIATELY MADE A VERBAL NOTIFICATION TO THE STATE POLICE ON THIS MATTER.

THE VEHICLE IN QUESTION HAD FLIPPED SEVERAL TIMES AND THE CONTENTS HAD BEEN EXPELLED.  SOME OF THE AMMO CANS HAD OPENED AND THERE WERE PIGS ON THE GROUND.  ACCORDING TO CT DEP, ONE OF THE PIGS WAS OPEN AND SOME MATERIAL HAD LEAKED OUT.  AT THIS POINT I CONTACTED CHIEF OATES AND GOT HIS REPORT THEN I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT.  WHEN I ARRIVED, CT DEP, CT STATE POLICE, AND THE WEST HARDFORD FIRE DEPT WERE ON THE SCENE.  THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED ON INTERSTATE 84 HEADING EASTBOUND IN THE VICINITY OF EXIT 43. ( WEST HARTFORD)   THE TRUCK HAD ALREADY BEEN PLACED ON THE BACK OF A FLATBED TOW TRUCK.  THERE WERE DELIVERY CANS DISPERSED ON THE GROUND, SOME OF WHICH WERE INTACT AND SOME THAT WERE NOT INTACT.  THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 25-30 PIGS ON THE GROUND THAT HAD COME OUT OF DELIVERY CANS.  THEY ALL SEEMED TO BE INTACT.  THE CT DEP REPRESENTATIVE IN CHARGE WAS SURVEYING AN AREA OF THE ROADWAY THAT HAD ONE OPEN PIG THAT WAS LEAKING MATERIAL.  MICHAEL FIRSICK (CT DEP) ASKED ME SOME CURSORY QUESTIONS AS TO THE CONTENTS OF THE VEHICLE AND THEN CONTINUED TO SURVEY THE AREA.  THE OTHER DEP REPRESENTATIVE WAS SURVEYING THE AREA  WHERE THE DELIVERY CANS AND PIGS WERE ON THE GROUND.  ONCE HE HAD CLEARED THE AREA, I WAS INSTRUCTED TO BEGIN CLEANING UP THE CANS/PIGS.  DICK IDENT, CSA SUPERVISOR, HAD ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT THIS POINT WITH A METER, GLOVES AND EMPTY DELIVERY CANS.  SINCE SEVERAL OF THE CANS THAT WERE IN THE ACCIDENT WERE DAMAGED, WE NEEDED TO USE THE NEW DELIVERY CANS THAT HE BROUGHT.  ALL THE CANS/PIGS WERE COLLECTED AND SECURED IN THE BACK OF DICK'S DELIVERY TRUCK. BY THIS TIME THE DEP HAD DECONTAMINATED THE ROADWAY AND DEEMED THE AREA ACCEPTABLE FOR RELEASE.  AT THAT POINT I RETURNED TO THE PHARMACY AND NOTIFIED WILLIE REGITS AT Q & R. ( 1100AMEST)     NOTE: THE VEHICLE ONLY CONTAINED LIMITED QUANTITY RETURN CANS.  ALL OTHER CANS HAD ALREADY BEEN DELIVERED.  NOTE: THE DRIVER OF OUR TRUCK (LYNNWOOD) WAS INJURED IN THE ACCIDENT.  HE HAD ALREADY BEEN TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL BY THE TIME I ARRIVED AT THE SCENE.  THE EXTENT OF HIS INJURIES ARE NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME OTHER THAN THEY WERE NOT LIFE-THREATENING.  NOTE:  THERE WAS ANOTHER VEHICLE INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT.

AFTER PRESSURE WAS APPLIED INTERNALLY TO OFF LOAD INTO THE CUSTOMER STORAGE TANK A LEAK DEVELOPED AT THE REAR BOTTOM, APPROXIMATELY 16"" IN FRONT OF THE SUMP. HONEYWELL'S DRIVERS STOPPED THE UNLOADING PROCESS IMMEDIATELY AFTER FINDING THE LEAKAGE.  AT THIS POINT THE HONEYWELL DRIVER'S PINPOINTED THE LEAKAGE AREA AND WERE ASKED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE AREA BY EXXONMOBIL WHICH IN TURN TOOK OVER CONTROL OF THE LEAKING TRAILER.  HONEYWELL WAS THEN CONTACTED BY EXXONMOBIL FOR ASSISTANCE IN MITIGATING THE LEAK.  ALL HONEYWELL-GEISMAR CONCERNED PARTIES WERE NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT INCLUDING PLANT MANAGEMENT, HSE, MAINTENANCE, AND LOGISTICS & DISTRIBUTION.  IN ADDITION, HF TECHNICAL SERVICE, THE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS BUSINESS GROUP AND HONEYWELL CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT WERE NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.  FINALLY, HONEYWELL MADE A REQUEST TO EXXONMOBIL TO CONTACT THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER TO REPORT THE LEAK.  TO EXPEDITE A SAFE CONCLUSION TO THIS INCIDENT, HONEYWELL (GEISMAR) REQUESTED THAT THE TRAILER BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE OFF LOADING.  DURING THIS TIME PERIOD A WATER FOG WAS APPLIED TO TRAILER TO KNOCK DOWN THE MHF FUMES. AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BY BOTH PARTIES TO CONTINUE OFF LOADING. UNLOADING WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY HAVING THE HONEYWELL DRIVER'S RADIO THE EXXONMOBIL TECHNICIANS WITH EACH STEP REQUIRED TO UNLOAD.  FOLLOWING THE SUCCESSFUL OFF LOADING OF THE PRODUCT, EXXONMOBIL PULLED A VACUUM ON THE TRAILER TO REDUCE THE INTERNAL PRESSURE TO ZERO PSI.  A WATER FOG SPRAY WAS STILL POINTED AT THE LEAK AREA WHILE THE VACUUM WAS BEING PULLED.  ON 3-28-04 JAMES WATSON FROM HONEYWELL ARRIVED AT THE TORRANCE, EXXONMOBIL PLANT SITE TO INSPECT THE T 875.  A CONTACT POINT WAS SET UP WITH HONEYWELL BEFORE ENTERING THE PLANT WITH INFORMATION BEING RELAYED FROM BLAKE WISEMAN, JOHN MCCARTHY, BOB PRATT, AND JEFF LEESE.  IT WAS AGREED UPON TO USE JEFF LEESE AS THE MAIN CONTACT TO AVOID COMMUNICATION CONFUSION WHILE DEALING WITH THE ISSUE ON HAND.  JEFF SUPPLIED JAMES WITH CONTACT INSIDE THE PLANT (MITCH SCHIPIRO).  AFTER MEETING WITH MITCH AND PLANT PERSONNEL, MITCH STATED A NEED TO PLUG/PATCH THE LEAK TO PULL A BETTER MINUS.  A PLAN WAS DEVELOPED AND PUT IN PLACE TO SAFELY PLUG THE LEAK.  THE LEAK WAS SUCCESSFULLY STOPPED BY APPLYING A BELLY BAND TYPE OF STRAP PATCH.  ONCE THE PATCH WAS APPLIED THE MINUS PULLED DOWN GREATLY ALLOWING THE WATER FOG TO BE REMOVED WHICH REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF WATER RUN OFF AT THE LEAK SITE. ON 3-29-04, MONDAY MORNING MEETINGS WERE HELD BETWEEN TORRANCE, EXXONMOBIL, GEISMAR AND MORRISTOWN TO DISCUSS THE SAFE WATER WASH AND WATER DISCHARGE AT THE TORRANCE PLANT SITE.  JEFF LEESE PROVIDED WASHOUT PROCEDURES TO TORRANCE TO PROVIDE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS TO TAKE PLACE DURING WASHOUT.

AFTER PRESSURE WAS APPLIED INTERNALLY TO OFF LOAD INTO THE CUSTOMER STORAGE TANK A LEAK DEVELOPED AT THE REAR BOTTOM, APPROXIMATELY 16"" IN FRONT OF THE SUMP. HONEYWELL'S DRIVERS STOPPED THE UNLOADING PROCESS IMMEDIATELY AFTER FINDING THE LEAKAGE.  AT THIS POINT THE HONEYWELL DRIVER'S PINPOINTED THE LEAKAGE AREA AND WERE ASKED TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE AREA BY EXXONMOBIL WHICH IN TURN TOOK OVER CONTROL OF THE LEAKING TRAILER.  HONEYWELL WAS THEN CONTACTED BY EXXONMOBIL FOR ASSISTANCE IN MITIGATING THE LEAK.  ALL HONEYWELL - GEISMAR CONCERNED PARTIES WERE NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT INCLUDING PLANT MANAGEMENT, HSE, MAINTENANCE, AND LOGISTICS & DISTRIBUTION.  IN ADDITION, HF TECHNICAL SERVICE, THE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS BUSINESS GROUP AND HONEYWELL CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT WERE NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.  FINALLY, HONEYWELL MADE A REQUEST TO EXXONMOBIL TO CONTACT THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER TO REPORT THE LEAK.  TO EXPEDITE A SAFE CONCLUSION TO THIS INCIDENT, HONEYWELL (GEISMAR) REQUESTED THAT THE TRAILER BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE OFF LOADING.  DURING THIS TIME PERIOD A WATER FOG WAS APPLIED TO TRAILER TO KNOCK DOWN THE MHF FUMES. AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED BY BOTH PARTIES TO CONTINUE OFF LOADING. UNLOADING WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY HAVING THE HONEYWELL DRIVER'S RADIO THE EXXONMOBIL TECHNICIANS WITH EACH STEP REQUIRED TO UNLOAD.  FOLLOWING THE SUCCESSFUL OFF LOADING OF THE PRODUCT, EXXONMOBIL PULLED A VACUUM ON THE TRAILER TO REDUCE THE INTERNAL PRESSURE TO ZERO PSI.  A WATER FOG SPRAY WAS STILL POINTED AT THE LEAK AREA WHILE THE VACUUM WAS BEING PULLED.  ON 3-28-04 JAMES WATSON FROM HONEYWELL ARRIVED AT THE TORRANCE, EXXONMOBIL PLANT SITE TO INSPECT THE T 875.  A CONTACT POINT WAS SET UP WITH HONEYWELL BEFORE ENTERING THE PLANT WITH INFORMATION BEING RELAYED FROM BLAKE WISEMAN, JOHN MCCARTHY, BOB PRATT, AND JEFF LEESE.  IT WAS AGREED UPON TO USE JEFF LEESE AS THE MAIN CONTACT TO AVOID COMMUNICATION CONFUSION WHILE DEALING WITH THE ISSUE ON HAND.  JEFF SUPPLIED JAMES WITH CONTACT INSIDE THE PLANT (MITCH SCHIPIRO).  AFTER MEETING WITH MITCH AND PLANT PERSONNEL, MITCH STATED A NEED TO PLUG/PATCH THE LEAK TO PULL A BETTER MINUS.  A PLAN WAS DEVELOPED AND PUT IN PLACE TO SAFELY PLUG THE LEAK.  THE LEAK WAS SUCCESSFULLY STOPPED BY APPLYING A BELLY BAND TYPE OF STRAP PATCH.  ONCE THE PATCH WAS APPLIED THE MINUS PULLED DOWN GREATLY ALLOWING THE WATER FOG TO BE REMOVED WHICH REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF WATER RUN OFF AT THE LEAK SITE.",,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,700,HONEYWELL,US,
