IN ADDITION, CHEMTREC WAS ASKED TO ACTIVATE THEIR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM TO MOBILIZE A TEAM OF HAZMAT RESPONDERS FROM PHILLIPS 66 AT BORGER.  THE RELEASE RESULTED FROM SEVERED PIPING ON STATIONARY STORAGE TANK AND THE PUMPING APPARATUS.  A NEW 7000 GALLONS PORTABLE STORAGE TANK HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE UNLOADING FACILITY. IT WAS SUPPORTED BY TWO CONCRETE CRADLES, EACH PLACED AT THE END OF A SKID-LIKE FRAME.  THIS WAS THE FIRST TRANSFER FROM A RAIL CAR INTO THE NEW TANK.  APPARENTLY THE WEIGHT OF THE PRODUCT FILLING THE TANK CAUSED THE SKID FRAME TO BUCKLE ACCOUNT SPACING OF THE CRADLES.  WHEN THE FRAME BICKLED, IT DEFORMED THE RIGID PIPING BETWEEN THE TWO TANKS, PUMPED AND RAIL CAR.  THEIS RESULTED IN SEVERED PIPES AND PERMITTED RELEASE OF THE PRODUCT ALREADY IN THE NEW TANK.  FLOW OF PRODUCT FROM THE TANK CAR CEASED DUE TO THE EXCESS FLOW CHECK VALVES INCLUDED IN THE CAR'S DESIGN; HOWEVER, VALVES HAD TO BE CLOSED ON THE TANKS AND PUMPS TO STOP THE RELEASE OF PRODUCT.  THE FIRE DEPARTENT SPRAYED THE RELEASED PRODUCT WITH WATER TO CONTROL THE VAPORS.  A RESULTING POOL OF CORROSIVE LIQUID COVERED AN AREA OF ABOUT 10,000 SQUARE FEET BETWEEN THE RAIL CAR AND RAILWAY'S MAIN TRACK. A PUMP TRUCK WAS UTILIZED TO RECOVER LIQUID FROM THE POLING AREA.

COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS NOTIFIED BY ROBERT SCHUT, SUPERVISOR, YARD OPERATIONS, YERMO, CALIFORNIA, THAT A TANK CAR WAS NOTED LEAKING UPON ARRIVAL AT YERMO.  TANK CAR CELX 5133, MOVING IN THE HKYR-01, NEAR THE REAR OF THE TRAIN, ARRIVED YERMO AT 1000 HOURS, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 7 1996.  LIQUID WAS LEAKING FROM THE TOP AREA AND RUNNING DOWN BOTH SIDES OF THE TANK CAR.  THE TANK CAR WAS LEFT IN PLACE AND THE IMMEDIATE AREA WAS KEPT ISOLATED PENDING INSPECTION.  MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE YERMO FACILITY AND FOUND THE TANK WAS STILL LEAKING DOWN BOTH SIDES OF THE CAR AT AN APPROXIMATE RATE OF 1/2 GALLON PER MINUTE.  THE WAYBILL INFORMATION SHOWED THE CONTENTS OF THE CAR TO BE ETHYL METHYL KETONE, UN1193, HOWEVER, THE TANK CAR WAS PLACARDED UN1224. USING THE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE NUMBER FROM THE WAYBILL, CONTACTED LARRY GROCHOLSKI, SECURITY, CELANESE, EDMONTON, ALBERTA, CANADA, WHO STATED HE WOULD HAVE SOME CONTACT THE RAILROAD.  WHILE WAITING FOR THE RETURN CALL, MANAGER COOPER INSPECTED THE TANK CAR IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  UPON CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF THE CAR, OBSERVED PRODUCT TO BE LEAKING FROM THE CLOSING EDGE (OPPOSITE OF THE HINGE) OF THE MANWAY COVER PLATE WHERE THE GASKET SEPERATES THE PLATE FROM THE MANWAY NOZZLE.  ALL EIGHT OF THE MANWAY COVER PLATE SWING BOLTS WERE TIGHT, WHICH INDICATED A BAD MANWAY COVER PLATE SWING BOLTS WERE TIGHT, WHICH INDICATED A BAD MANWAY COVER PLATE SWING BOLTS WERE TIGHT, WHICH INDICATED A BAD MANWAY GASKET.  THE PROTECTIVE COVER HOUSING FOR THE VALVES WAS OPENED AFTER REMOVING SECURITY SEAL CNR93W10544910 FROM THE SEAL PIN.  CHECKING THE CLOSURE PLUG FOR THE AIR LINE FOUND THE PLUG ONLY FINGER TIGHT, HOWEVER, THE BALL VALVE WAS CLOSED, AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF LEAKAGE.  THE PLUG WAS REMOVED AND THE BALL VALVE ON THE AIR LINE WAS CRACKED OPEN TO REDUCE THE INTERNAL PRESSURE OF THE TANK CAR.  THERE WAS VERY LITTLE PRESSURE ON THE CAR AS THE VALVE ONLY INDICATED A SMALL AMOUNT OF RELEASE FOR LESS THAN TWO MINUTES.  ONCE THE INTERNAL PRESSURE WAS REDUCED, THE FLOW FROM THE MANWAY CEASED.  THE MANWAY BOLT SECURITY SEAL CNR93W10544910 WAS REMOVED IN ORDER TO LOOSEN THE MANWAY SWING BOLTS AND OPEN THE COVER PLATE.  UPON OPENING THE COVER PLATE, OBSERVED PRODUCT TO THE TOP OF THE MANWAY NOZZLE.  THE MANWAY GASKET WAS LOOSE AND PULLED AWAY FROM THE COVER PLATE.  INSPECTION OF THE GASKET REVEALED SIGNS OF IT BEING CROSSED BETWEEN THE COVER PLATE AND NOZZLE.  THERE WERE NUMEROUS CRACKS AND TEARS ON THE RUBBER GASKET, INDICATING IT HAD BEEN IN SERVICE FOR SOME TIME. THE COVER PLATE WAS LEFT PROPPED OPEN UTILIZING ONE OF THE SWING BOLTS, AND THEN COVERED WITH A PLASTIC SHEET TO PREVENT ANY FOREIGN CONTAMINATION OF THE LADING.
