He soon noticed a small leak coming from the bottom of the drum.  He immediately took the drum back into the hazardous material storage room in our warehouse facility and positioned it on its side so that it would not leak any more.  It is estimated that less than one pint of product leaked out.  The spilled material was cleaned up and disposed of.  NAC received the drum filled with product from the supplier.  It is believed that the spill is the result of an object puncturing the bottom of the drum when it was placed on the floor of the trailer during loading.  The drum was placed in a salvage drum.,"We notified the supplier of the product about this spill and requested that it inspected all metal drums prior to transport.  North American Composites purchased the product from Norac, the supplier.  The product was shipped to and received by our facility in Garland, TX.

DUE TO THE MATERIALS INVOLVED, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO LEAVE THE UNITS BURN THEMSELVES OUT TO AVOID ANY ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION.  THE FIRE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FOUR CARTONS OF ORGANIC PEROXIDE, CONSUMED ALL OF THE FREIGHT IN THE PITT OHIO UNIT.  THE FOUR CARTONS OF ORGANIC PEROXIDE WERE THROWN OUT OF THE REAR OF THE UNIT DURING IMPACT.  THESE UNITS DID NOT LEAK AND ONLY HAD THE OUTSIDE CARTON DAMPENED BY WATER.

APPROXIMATELY 1/4 OF A GALLON WAS RELEASED AT THE WEIGHT STATIONM AND <10 GALLONS WERE IN THE REAR OF THE TRAILER. AT APPROXIMATELY 8:55 P.M.

BASED ON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY KLLM TRANSPORT SERVICES AND THE DRIVER OF THE TRACTOR TRAILER, THE CES INCIDENT MANAGER DISPATCHED A CREW FROM D&H PUMP SERVICES (D&H) TO PERFORM THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS.  THE CREW FROM D&H ARRIVED ON-SITE TO ASSESS THE SCOPE OF THE RELEASE.  THE TRACTOR TRAILER HAD NOT BEEN MOVED FROM THE INTIAL LOCATION AT THE TRAILER DOORS REMAINED LOCKED.  DUE TO THE RANGE OF CHEMICALS BEING TRANSPORTED IN THE TRAILER THE CREW DONNED THE PROPER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) BEFORE ENTERING THE TRAILER.  ONCE THE TRAILER DOORS WERE OPENED AND THE CREW ENTERED THE TRAILER, IT WAS THEN THAT THE CREW LEARNED THAT THE RELEASED CHEMICAL WAS METHANOL SULFURIC ACID.  THE RELEASE OF THE ACID HAD SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER, AND THE TRAILER WOULD HAVE TO BE UNLOADED.  THE WEIGHT STATION WOULD NOT PERMIT THE CLEAN UP ACTIONS TO BE PERFORMED ON THE TRAILER AT THEIR FACILITY.  WITH APPROVAL FROM KLLM TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND THE CES INCIDENT MANAGER THE D&H CREW ASSISTED THE DRIVER AND HIS VEHCILE TO THEIR SHOP TO PERFORM THE REMEDIATION OF THE TRAILER.  BEFORE THE TRANSPORT WAS MADE THE CREW REMEDIATED THE CONCRETE OF THE WEIGHT STATION BY NEUTRALIZING THE SOLUTION AND APPLYING ABSORBENT MATERIALS.  THOSE MATERIALS WERE PLACED INTO A DRUM FOR DISPOSAL.  THE TRAILER WAS THEN STABILIZED FOR TRANSPORT.

It appeared the puncture occurred at the loading facility (Salt Lake City).  The freight was shrinkwrapped on a pallet of 15 cardboard cartons.  Approximately 1 tablespoon had been released upon moving the freight, and was unrecoverable due to wind blowing the product from the dock.  The entire shrinkwrapped pallet was covered in plastic and isolated, pending further action.

This shipment was transferred to DL in a manner that would not have required inspection prior to transport. All packages appeared in good condition and air worthy. Upon arriving in Oklahoma City, after being transported on several Delta flights and transferred to a bonded warehouse, U.S. Customs inspected the shipment and seized it for further analysis. After further review and some time had passed, U.S. Customs agent Tom Pomelow informed OKC cargo that Butane lighters were found in this shipment. This notification to Delta was made near the end of March 2005. At that time Delta's Corporate office was notified and the process to report to FAA was started. FAA agent Bob Bergen was notified via phone of the incident. The shipment had been destroyed by U.S. Customs; however pictures were obtained by Delta prior to that. Agent Bergen and Delta's Corporate Dangerous Goods group informed OKC of the necessity to complete the 5800.1 report.",Delta was not aware of this situation until U.S. Customs notified us of their findings.

BOX 68900,SEATTLE,WA,98168,Carrier,"Upon arrival of Flight 64 in Petersburg, the ramp crew opened the forward pit door to begin unloading bags from pit 3. A thick, white foamy substance was found near the door and running forward into pit 1. The pit 1 net was taken down and some boxes and bags were removed. Two 1-gallon plastic containers of Nu-Brite being shipped to Wrangell were discovered, one container was sitting upright on the floor, the other container was near the bulkhead positioned on its side, stacked about half way up from the floor. The solution apparently leaked from this container, as a subsequent review of the caps revealed a damaged, wet seal under the cap of the container that had been found on its side. Alaska Airlines Maintenance Control and Environmental Affairs were contacted after consulting with the Pilot-In-Command. An Alaska Airlines mechanic was dispatched to Petersburg from Juneau. Everything was removed from pits 1-2, and as directed, the mechanic inspected the pits, then neutralized the contaminated areas with mild acid, then wiped the pits with clean water. We estimate less than a cup leaked during transport.  - David Nielsen  Customer Service Manager  Petersburg, AK   907-772-3328","Follow proper acceptance procedures, including adequate packaging and documentation.

BROOKFIELD WI.  I CONTACTED THE NIGHT SUPERVISOR FOR THE REVIEW OF THE PAPERWORK.  THEN PROCEEDED TO POSITION THE DELIVERY VEHICLE (7528) DIRECTLY BEHIND THE RECEPTACLE (7260).  I INSTALLED THE DELIVERY CONNECTOR TO 7260 AND THE DELIVERY HOSE FROM 7528.  AFTER THE APPROPRIATE PUMP COOL DOWN PERIOD, I DELIVERED 453000 CU FT INTO 7260.  UPON COMPLETION OF THE DELIVERY, I SHUT OFF THE PUMP AND CLOSED THE DELIVERY VALVE AND PB VALVE ON 7528.  I THEN RECORDED THE LEVEL GAGE AND PRESSURE READINGS FROM 7260.  ONCE THE CORRECT PRESSURE WAS REACHED IN 7260 I CLOSED THE VENT VALE AND TAPPED THE HOSE CONNECTION WITH MY HAMMER.  I IMMMEDIATELY REALIZED I HAD NOT CLOSED THE FILL VALVE ON 7260, SO I CLIMBED ONTO THE STEP AT THE BACK OF THE TRAILER AND BEGAN TO CLOSE THE VALVE.  SUDDENLY THERE WAS A LOUD BANG TO MY LEFT AND I WAS THROWN FROM THE TRAILER STEP.  I LANDED ON MY HANDS AND KNEES ON THE GROUND AND BECAME VARY AWARE OF A LOUD ROARING SOUND BEHIND ME.  I SCRAMBLED TO MY FEET AND VERY QUICKLY MOVED AWAY FROM THE NOISE.  WHEN I TURNED AROUND BOTH 7528 AND 7260 WHERE BEING ENGULFED IN A LARGE WHITE CLOUD OF PRODUCT.  I RAN INTO THE BUILDING, FOUND THE NIGHT SUPERVISOR (JAKE) AND INFORMED HIM OF THE SITUATION.  WE BOTH WENT BACK OUTSIDE TO FIND THE ENTIRE PARKING AREA COVERED BY THE CLOUD.  JAKE WENT BACK INTO THE BUILDING TO CLOSE ANY OPEN DOORS ON THE SIDE OF THE PRODUCT LEAK.  I MADE FEW EFFORTS TO RETRIEVE MY PHONE FROM THE TRACTOR, BUT AT FIRST I COULDN'T FIND THE TRACTOR IN THE CLOUD.  FINALLY A BREEZE BLEW THE CLOUD FAR ENOUGH BACK SO THE I COULD GET IN TO THE TRUCK AND GET THE PHONE.  I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND INFORMED THEM IF THE INCIDENT IN PROGRESS AND THAT TRAILER TIRES MAY NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I THEN CALLED PRAXAIR DISPATCH AND INFORMED THEM OF THE SITUATION, AND THAT I WAS UNHARMED BUT I WASN'T SURE ABOUT EQUIPMENT.  I ALSO CALLED DENNIS KURTS IN THE HOPES OF FINDING ANY IDEAS TO STOP THE LEAKAGE.  I KEPT PACING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE FRONT OF THE DELIVERY UNIT TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO STOP THE LEAK.  A GOOD 35 TO 40 MINUTES PASSED WITH PRODUCT LEAKING FROM 7260.  THE CLOUD CONTINUED TO COVER THE ENTIRE PARKING AREA AT PDI AS WELL AS FLOATING ACROSS I-94.  JAKE INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD CALLED EMERGENCY SERVICES AND SAFETY TEAM FOR PDI.  DURING MY SECOND CALL TO MARK NELSON A BREEZE BLEW THE CLOUD AWAY FROM THE BACK OF THE TWO TRAILERS.  I COULD PLAINLY SEE THE PRODUCT SQUIRTING FROM THE TRAILER THE VALVE THAT NEEDED TO BE CLOSED.  I TOOK THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RUSH IN AND CLOSE THE VALVE, STOPPING THE LEAK.  SEEING THE STUB PORTION OF THE FILL COUPLING STILL IN THE THREADS OF MY DELIVERY HOSE I QUICKLY DISASSEMBLED IT FEARING IT WOULD SEIZE IN THE HOSE AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO REMOVE IT FOR HOURS.  BY THIS TIME THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD SHOWN UP AND I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION TO THEM, AND OFFERED WHATEVER INFORMATION THEY REQUESTED.
