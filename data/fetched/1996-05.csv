OUR DRIVER WAS FINISHING MAKING A LANE CHANGE (RIGHT TO LEFT), AS HE APPROACHED THE INTERSECTION OF HOLLAND BROOK RD. HE SAW A DARK COLORED VAN (1990 CHEVROLET) PULL OUT INTO THE SOUTHBOUND TRAFFIC LANES WITHOUT YIELDING TO TRAFFIC. THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE, A SEVEENTEEN (17) YEAR OLD FEMALE, PULLED OUT INTO THE ROADWAY LOOKING TO HER RIGHT. THERE WAS ALSO A 15 YEAR OLD FEMALE PASSENGER IN THE VAN. OUR DRIVER SOUNDED HIS AIR HORN AND STEERED TO THE LEFT IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID HITTING THE VAN. THE DRIVER OF THE VAN NEVER TURNED TO THE LEFT UP AND TO THE POINT OF IMPACT. THE VAN CONTINUED ACROSS THE INTERSECTION COLLIDING WITH THE FRONT RIGHT OF OUR TRACTOR AND HER FRONT LEFT. OUR DRIVER HAD TO STEER RIGHT JUST ABOUT AT THE POINT OF IMPACT, DUE TO ANOTHER VEHICLE WHICH WAS PREPARING TO TURN IN THE NORTHBOUND RT. 202 TURNING LANE. AFTER OUR TRACTOR COLLIDED WITH THE VAN, OUR DRIVER STATED THAT HE THEN SWERVED TO THE RIGHT, LOST SOME STEERING AND PROCEEDED TO CLIMB AN EMBARKMENT, AND FINALLY CAME TO A STOP. OUR DRIVER WAS PREPARING TO RELEASE HIS SEATBELT WHEN THE ENTIRE TRACTOR TRAILER UNIT BEGAN TO ROLLOVER TO THE LEFT ONTO THE ROADWAY. OUR DRIVER EXITED THE TRACTOR THROUGH THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW AND PROCEEDED TO RUN DOWN TOWARDS THE INTERSECTION. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT RT. 202 SOUTHBOUND HAS A DECLINE DOWN WHEN APPROACHING HOLLAND BROOK RD., AND AN INCLINE AFTER THE INTERSECTION. OUR DRIVER BEGAN TO WARN TRAFFIC BEHIND HIS VEHICLE TO KEEP BACK AND TO CLEAR THE LOW AREA, DUE TO SEEPAGE OF GASOLINE PRODUCT FROM THE CARGO TANK TRAILER RUNNING DOWNHILL TOWARDS THE INTERSECTION. AT THIS TIME, OUR DRIVER SAW AN EMT (EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN) WHO APPARENTELY SAW THE ACCIDENT AND WENT TO HIM. WHILE WAITING FOR AN AMBULANCE, OUR DRIVER WAS SITTING ON A CURB AND SPEAKING WITH THE TWO OCCUPANTS (GIRLS) OF THE VAN. ONE OF THE GIRLS (THE DRIVER) WAS CRYING AND APOLOGIZING TO OUR DRIVER FOR WHAT SHE HAD DONE. OUR DRIVER ALONG WITH TWO FEMALES FROM THE CHEVROLET VAN WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE SOMERSET MEDICAL CENTER, IN SOMERVILLE, NJ FOR TREATMENT OF INJURIES. OUR DRIVER SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES TO HIS HEAD, CHEST AND ABDOMEN. THE INJURIES TO THE TWO FEMALES IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME. OUR DRIVER INFORMED US THAT THE OCCUPANTS OF THE VAN WERE SHAKEN UP, BUT NOT SEVERELY INJURED. OUR DRIVER WAS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT. LOCAL POLICE, FIRE DEPARTMENTS, AND HAZ-MAT SPILL RESPONSE TEAMS WERE SUMMONDED TO THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT. RT. 202 WAS SHUTDOWN IN BOTH DIRECTIONS TO ALL TRAFFIC. HAZ-MAT OPERATIONS WERE INITIATED AND PRODUCT TRANSFER FROM THE OVERTURNED TANKER TO A STANDBY TRAILER WERE CONDUCTED.

I CALLED THE ANSWERING SERVICE AT 8:09PM AND TALKED TO AN OPERATOR BY THE NAME OF CARLOS, HE STATED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE A CALL FOR ME AND CHECKED WITH THE OTHER OPERATORS AND SAID THEY HAD NO CALLS FOR ME, THAT I WAS PAGED BY MISTAKE.  AT 8:24PM, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM OUR ANSWERING SERVICE FROM AN OPERATOR BY THE NAME OF PEPPI.  HE INFORMED ME THAT THE LEBANON FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED AND SAID, ""FLAMGAS HAS A LEAK AT THEIR RAIL STORAGE FACILITY ON BADDOUR PARKWAY AND THAT SOMEONE IS NEEDED ON SCENE TO OPEN THE GATE AND CONTAIN THE LEAK.""  I THEN CALLED THE LEBANON  FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND WAS TOLD TO GET THERE A.S.A.P.  WHEN I ARRIVED AT 8:44 PM BADDOUR PARKWAY WAS SHUT DOWN FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE HALF MILE ON EACH SIDE OF THE FACILITY AND THE PRO BOWL WEST HAD BEEN EVACUTED.  I WAS THEN TOLD THE LEAK WAS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE FACILITY AT THE COMPRESSORS.  I WALKED TO COMPRESSORS AND OBSERVED A LEAK OF LIQUID PROPANE AT THE FIRST COMPRESSOR.  THE EMERGENCY PERSONELL HAD ALREADY MANAGED TO GET THRU THE FENCE AND START TO TURN OFF THE VALVES.  I OBSERVED THE LEAK TO BE AT THE HOSE OF THE FLEX JOINT AT THE CLAMP COUPLING.  I PROCEEDED TO CUT OFF ALL VALVING AND BLED LIQUID FROM THE COMPRESSOR.  THE EMERGENCY TEAM AND I THEN WENT ACROSS THE STREET TO CHECK THE STORAGE TANKS AND TO CUT THE PIPELINE CAPTIAN CHARLIE ALSUP, THAT THE GATES WERE FOUND TO BE OPEN UPON THEIR ARRIVAL.  I CHECKED THE LOCKS AND POINTED OUT TO THEM THAT THE LOCK WAS LEFT OPEN BY THE CITY OF LEBANON EMPLOYEES, AS OUR LOCK WAS LOCKED AND SECURE.  AFTER WE TURNED OFF ALL PIPELINE VALVING AND SECURED THE GATE, BADDOUR PARKWAY WAS THEN OPENED TO TRAFFIC.  IT WAS CLOSED OFF APPROXIMATELY ONE AND ONE HALF HOURS. THE PROBLEM APPARENTLY RESULTED FROM THE VAPOR RECOVERY VALVE BEING LEFT ON, THE CHECK VALVE FAILING, ALLOWING LIQUID PROPANE TO MIGRATE TO THE COMPRESSORS AND TEMPERATURES BEING IN THE LOW NINETIES THAT DAY AND THE LIQUID EXPANDING.  THEN, AFTER SUNDOWN THE CONTRACTION CAUSED THE LEAK.  MAY 20, 199, FLAM GAS REPLACED THE TWO FLEX HOSES AND THE CHECK VALVE TO KEEP THIS FROM REOCCURING.  THIS WILL ALSO BE COVERED IN OUR NEXT SAFETY MEETING, SCHEDULED ON MAY 21, 1996.  UPON RECOMMENDATIONS BY CHIEF PRESTON AND CAPTAIN ALSUP, I WILL ARRANGE A WALK THRU OF ALL OUR FACILITIES IN LEBANON TO MAKE THEM FAMILIAR WITH THE LOCATIONS OF VALVING AND EMERGENCY SHUT OFF VALVES.

WE PROCEEDED TOWARDS THE ACCCIDENT SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00AM.  ALONG THE WAY WE MET UP WITH 2 EMPLOYEES FROM THE NATIONAL OIL SHOP, RUSSELL PENDLETON AND MIKE HOLMAN.  WE ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT AROUND 6:45 AM AND FOUND THE TRUCK AND TRAILER STILL RESTING ON IT'S PASSENGERS SIDE IN THE GRASSY AREA BETWEEN THE NORTH BOUND LANE OF 71 AND THE ON-RAMP ROAD LEADING TO THE NORTHBOUND LANES.  ASPHALT OIL WAS RUNNING WEST FROM THIS SITE THROUGH A WHISTLE UNDER THE SOUTH BOUND LANES OF 71, THEN EXTENDED ON WEST THROUGH A DITCH LEADING A TUNNEL WHICH WENT UNDERNEATH THE ON-RAMP ACCESS ROAD TO 71 NORTH.  USING A COUPLE OF DUMPTRUCK LOADS OF DIRT, THE NEVADA FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD SUCCESSFULLY STOPPED THE FLOW JUST BEYOND THIS TUNNEL, PREVENTING ANY OIL FROM TRAVELING INTO AN ADJACENT OUTER ROAD WHISTLE WHICH LED TO A SMALL STREAM THAT FEEDS THE NEVADA CITY PARK POND. THE TOTAL DISTANCE THAT THE ASPHALT OIL HAD TRAVELED WAS ESTIMATED TO BE AROUND 1/8TH OF A MILE.  AS WE TRAVELED TO THE SITE THAT MORNING IN OUR SEPARATE VEHICLES, BILL WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE NEVADA FIRE DEPARTMENT BY CELLULAR PHONE AND WAS INFORMED OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED OIL FLOW.  TALKING TO ME BY RADIO IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE WOULD NEED A VACCUM TRUCK TO COME TO THE SITE AND REMOVE THE OIL FROM THE DITCHES.  I TOLD HIM TO HAVE SOMEONE FROM NATIONAL OIL CONTACT MIDWEST ENVIRONMENTAL OUT OF CARTHAGE AND HAVE THEM SEND US THEIR VACUUM TRUCK.  A MISUNDERSTANDING ENSUED AND DUE TO THE FACT THAT MIDWEST ENVIRONMENTAL WOULD NOT BE DOING THE ENTIRE CLEANUP, WE WERE DECLINED THE USE OF THEIR VACUUM TRUCK, BUT PHIL ROSS OF MIDWEST ENVIRONMENTAL HAD ARRANGED FOR TWO VACCUM TRUCKS FROM HILLBILLY PUMPING AND HAULING OUT OF CATERVILLE, MO TO COME TO THE SCENE.  A TANKER FROM NATIONAL OIL WAS ALSO DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE FOR THE PURPOSE OF OFF LOADING THE REMAINING OIL IN THE WRECKED TANKER.  A LOCAL CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, CARLINI CONSTRUCTION CO., WAS ALSO ON SITE READY TO BEGIN SCRAPING AND DIRT REMOVAL PROCEDURES.  ONCE THE TANKER FROM NATIONAL HAD ARRIVED, RUSSELL, MIKE AND DRIVER RON BRANDT BEGAN PUMPING OFF THE REMAINING OIL.  ONCE  THEY REACHED THE POINT WHERE THE TANKER NEEDED TO BE UPRIGHTED TO RETRIEVE THE REST, THE WRECKER COMPANY ON SITE PROCEEDED TO SET THE TRUCK AND TANKER BACK ON IT'S WHEELS.  ONCE IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION, THE REMAINING OIL WAS PUMPED OFF AND THE TRUCK AND TRAILER WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE AND TAKEN TO BRINES WRECKER COMPANY IN SPRINGFIELD, MO.  THIS OIL WAS THEN TAKEN TO THE MISSOURI HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT FACILITY IN NEVADA AND PUMPED OFF INTO THEIR STORAGE TANK.
