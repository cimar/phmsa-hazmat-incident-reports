WE ARRIVED FOR THE DELIVERY AT APPROXIMATELY 0900 HOURS.  THE LONG ISLAND ARRIVED AT 1200 HOURS AND TIED UP ALONG SIDE THE CONIFER.  OUR DRIVER FIRST BOARDED THE LONG ISLAND TO VERIFY WE HAD PROPER FITTINGS OUR DRIVER AND HOSEMAN THEN HOOKED THE HOSE LENGTHS TOGETHER ON THE DOCK.  THE DRIVER VERIFIED THAT THE CAMLOCKS WWERE IN GOOD CONDITION AND NOT WORN. SEAMEN FROM THE LONG ISLAND CAME OVER TO THE CONIFER AND HAD OUR DRIVER HAND THEM THE HOSE FROM THE DOCK; THE SEAMEN THEN TOOK THE HOSE ACROSS THE CONIFER AND THEN ONTO THE LONG ISLAND.  THE LONG ISLAND SEAMEN KEPT IN CONTACT VIA TWO-WAY RADIOS.  FINALLY, VIA THE RADIO, SEAMEN ON THE LONG ISLAND ADVISED THE LONG ISLAND SEAMAN ON THE DOCK THAT THE HOSE CONNECTION HAD BEEN MADE ON THE LONG ISLAND AND THAT THE DELIVERY COULD BEGIN.  OUR DRIVER ASKED IF ALL VALVES WERE PROPERLY OPEN AND LONG ISLAND SEAMEN ADVISED OUR DRIVER THAT THEY WERE.  OUR DRIVER THEN OPENED THE TRUCK VALVE ABOUT 25% AND THEN BEGAN A NORMAL GRAVITY (NO PUMP) DELIVERY AFTER DETEMINING THAT THERE WERE NO FITTING OR OTHER LEAKS.  OUR HOSEMAN WAS ON THE CONIFER WHERE HE COULD TALK WITH BOTH THE BENETO DRIVER ON THE DOCK AND THE SEAMAN ON THE LONG ISLAND.  ALL HOSE FITTINGS WERE ON THE CONIFER EXCEPT THE FINAL CONNECTION ON THE LONG ISLAND AND THE BEGINNING CONNECTION AT THE BENETO TRUCK.  AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES IT BECAME APPARENT THAT PRODUCT WAS EITHER NOT MOVING OR MOVING VERY SLOWLY.  OUR DRIVER AGAIN QUESTIONED THE LONG ISLAND SEAMAN ABOUT ALL VALVES BEING OPEN AND WAS ADVISED THAT THE VALVES WERE OPEN.  OUR DRIVER AND HOSEMAN THEN WENT ON TOP THE BENETO TRUCK, DETEMINED PRODUCT WAS NOT LEAVING THE TRUCK, AND AGAIN ASKED ABOUT POSSIBLY CLOSED VALVES.  ADVISED THEY WERE ALL OPEN, THE DRIVER DECIDED TO PUMP THE PRODUCT TO THE LONG ISLAND.  HOSE CONNECTIONS WERE CHANGED AS NECESSARY, THE HOSEMAN RETURNED TO THE CONIFER AND THE PUMP WAS SLOWLY ENGAGED.  AS EXPECTED, THE HOSE STIFFENED, BUT A FEW DROPS OF PRODUCT DRIPPED FROM THE HOSE CONNECTIONS ON THE CONIFER BECAUSE HE KNEW THE PRODUCT WOULD NOT DRAIN FROM THE HOSE INTO THE LONG ISLAND, REQUESTED THE RESPONSIBLE SEAMAN FROM THE LONG ISLAND COME OVER TO THE CONIFER PUMPING IT BACK INTO THE TRUCK.  THIS NOT-UNUSUAL PROCEDURE IS ACCOMPLISHED BY SLOWLY CRACKING ONE OF THE CAMLOCKS AT THE CONNECTION POINT (IN THIS CASE ON THE LONG ISLAND), ALLOWING SOME AIR TO ENTER THE HOSE THEREBY PREMITTING THE PRODUCT TO BE PUMPED BACK INTO THE TRUCK.  THE SEAMAN WAS TOLD THAT IF THERE WAS ANY MINOR LEAKAGE TO SHUT THE CAMLOCK IMMEDIATELY.  HE WAS TOLD THAT THE DRIVER WOULD BEGIN THE PUMP, WOULD SIGNAL THE HOSEMAN THAT THE CAMLOCK SHOULD BE CRACKED AND THAT THE SEAMAN SHOULD WATCH THE HOSEMAN FOR THE SIGNAL TO CRACK THE CAMLOCK (THIS WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE DRIVER COULD NOT SEE THE SEAMAN AT THE CONNECTION POINT AND THE USCG PERSONNEL WITH TWO-WA",,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,12300,,US,

MICHAEL ROBERTSON, OUR DRIVER, STATED THAT HE HAD INSPECTED HIS LOAD WHILE AT A TRUCK STOP IN LAFAYETT, LA. AND ALL WAS FINE.  AFTER LEAVING, THE TRUCK STOP, A LOUISIANA STATE POLICE OFFICER NOTICED MATERIAL LEAKING FROM THE REAR OF THE TRAILER AND STOPPED MR. ROBERTSON.  AFTER STOPPING, MR. ROBERTSON PLACED AN OVERPACKE DRU, NORMALLY CARRIED UNDER OUT TRAILER, AT THE REAR OF THE TRAILER TO CATCH THE MATERIAL LEAKING FROM THE TRIALER. THE OFFICER WOULD NOT LET OUR DRIVER, OPEN THE DOOR OR ENTER THE TRAILER. MR. ROBERTSON THEN CALLED AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO ME.  AN OFFICER AT THE SCENE GAVE ME INFORMATION APPEARING ON THE MANIFESTS.  THERE WERE DIVISIONS 3, 6.1, 8, 9, CARRIED ON THIS LOAD.  I WAS NOT GIVEN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO DETERMINE IF A REPORTABLE QUANTITY HAD BEEN RELEASED, AS THE SOURCE AND MATERIAL WAS NOT KNOW AT THAT TIME.  I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED A RESPONSE CREW FROM CROWLEY LA TO RESPOND ON OUR BEHALF TO THE SCENE TO EFFECT CLEAN UP OPERATIONS.  I ADVISED OUR DRIVER TO NOTIFY ME IMMEDIATLEY UPON THE DISCOVERY OF THE EXACT MATERIAL THAT HAD BEEN SPILLED SO AS THE DETERMINE IF A REPORTABLE QUANTITY HAD BEEN RELEASED.  THE LAFAYETTE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAZ-MAT TEAM WAS CALLED OUT TO DETEMINE THE NATURE, EXTENT AND CAUSE OF THE SPILL.  AFTER ENTERING THE TRAILER, THE HAZ-MAT TEAM FOUND THAT THE DRUM DOLLY HAD LID FORWARD AND PUNCTURED THE BOTTOM OF ONE DRUM. THE LEAKING DRUM CONTAINED ""HAZARDOUS WASTE LIQUID, NOS, 3 PGIII UN1993 (METHYL ETHYL KETONE, TOLUNE).  NO REPORTABLE QUANTITIES WERE INVOLVED IN THIS SPILL.  THE CLEAN UP CREW RESPONDED TO THE SCENE AND PROMPTLY CLEANED THE SPILLED MATERIAL FROM THE GROUND AND INSIDE OF THE TRAILER.  THE DAMGED DRUM WAS PLACED INTO THE OVERPACK ALONG WITH THE ABSORBENT MATERIALS USED.  THE OVERPACKE THEN ACCOMPANIED THE REMAINDER TO THE ORIGINAL T.S.D. FACILITY DESTINATION, RENECO IN BENTON, AR.  ALTHOUGH ALL VAN TRAILERS OPERATED BY J.B. HUNT SPECIAL COMMODITIESARE SPECIALLY EQUIPPED WITH SPILL CONTAINMENT PANS, THIS WAS NOT EFFECTIVE DUE TO A TEAR IN THE REAR FLAP.  OUR TRAILERS ARE CURRENTLY BEING RETROFITTED WITH A DIFFERENT DESIGN REAR SEAL THAT DOES NOT USE A RUBBER FLAP.  WE FELL THAT THIS NEW DESIGN WILL BE SUPERIOR TO THE FLAP ARRANGEMENT, WHICH DID NOT HOLD UP WELL IN ROUGH USE.  THE DRUM DOLLY IS TO CARRIED IN A RACK UNDER THE TRAILER DESIGNED FOR THIS PURPOSE.  THE DRIVER WAS SEVERELY REPRIMANDED FOR NOT SECURING THE DRUM DOLLY AND ALLOWING THIS TO HAPPEN.
