DRIVER OPENED HIS TRAILER AND SAW THAT A DRUM HAD FALLEN OFF OF A PALLET AND HAD A SMALL HOLE NEAR THE TOP.  DRIVER ADVISED THAT HE SET THE DRUM UP AND STRUCK A PIECE OF STICK IN THE HOLE AND STOPPED THE LEAK.  APPROXIMATELY 2 GALLONS OF PRODUCT LEAKED OUT AND ALL OF IT REMAINED IN THE TRAILER.  DRIVER CALLED THE OFFICE AND WAS ADVISED TO THROW SOME SAND INTO THE TRAILER TO CONTAIN THE SPILL AND CALL BACK FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.  BOTH THE SHIPPER AND CHEMTREC WERE CALLED AND ADVISED THAT PRODUCT COULD BE ABSORBED AND THE DRUM OVERPACKED AND THEN CARRIED ON TO RECEIVER.  A RECOVERY DRUM WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES AWAY AT WATKINS MOTOR LINES.  SINCE NO PRODUCT HAD LEFT THE TRAILER AND THE SPILL SOURCE WAS TEMPORARILY STOPPED, DRIVER WAS ADVISED TO GO TO THE WATKINS MOTOR LINES TERMINAL TO HAVE THE DAMAGED DRUM PUT IN A RECOVERY DRUM.  THE DRUM WAS OVERPACKED AND DELIVERY MADE TO RECEIVER.  THE ABSORBING MATERAIL WAS SWEPT OUT OF THE TRAILER AND PLACED INTO THE RECOVERY DRUM AT THE RECEIVER.  DRUM WAS THEN TAKEN TO WATKINS MOTOR LINES IN HOUSTON, TX TO SEEK DISPOSITION.

THE 4-30 GALLON POLY OPEN HEAD DRUMS CONTAINED BETWEEN 10-15, 1 GALLON CONTAINERS OF THIONYL CHLORIDE. THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE STOPPED HIS VEHICLE AT THE NORTH LITTLE ROCK ""76"" TRUCK STOP ON I-40 AND GALLOWAY - EXIT 161 AND CONDUCTED A LOAD/TIRE CHECK.  IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT HE NOTICED FUMES ESCAPING FROM THE TRAILER'S BACK DOOR.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED A CLEAN HARBOR TERMINAL, WHO THEN IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE ARKANSAS STATE POLICE.  THE ARKANSAS STATE POLICE DISPATCHED THE LITTLE ROCK FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENT, WHO UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SCENE, MOVED THE TRUCK TO A REMOTE SECTION OF THE TRUCK STOP AND RESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE AREA.  THE FIRE CHIEF PROVIDED THE NAME OF A LOCAL SPILL CONTRACTOR IN THE EVENT CLEAN HARBORS COULD NOT MOBILIZE A CREW IN A TIMELY MANNER.  DUE TO THE DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST CLEAN HARBORS EMERGENCY RESPONSE GROUP IT WAS DECIDED THAT SPILL TECH SERVICES OUT OF LITTLE ROCK, AR. WOULD PERFORM THE RESPONSE. TECHNICIANS FROM SPILL TECH ENTERED THE VEHICLE UNDER LEVEL A PROTECTION AND DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THE LIDS FROM A 30 GALLON CONTAINER HAD DISLODGED DUE TO THE BUILD-UP OF PRESSURE UNDER THE LID.  IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE CLOSURES ON 3-4 CONTAINERS PACKED INSIDE THE 30 GALLON DRUM HAD FAILED AND THE THIONYL CHLORIDE BEGAN TO FUME ON CONTACT WITH RESIDUAL MOISTURE IN THE VERMICULITE THAT WAS USED AS PACKING MATERIAL. SPILL TECH REPACKAGED ALL THE DAMAGED CONTAINERS AND REPACKED THE DRUMS IN THE 30 GALLON CONTAINERS.  EACH 30 GALLON DRUM WAS THEN OVERPACKED INTO 85 GALLON SALVAGE DRUMS AS A PRECAUTION.  ALL MATERIAL THAT WAS GENERATED AS A RESULT OF THE RESPONSE WAS MANIFESTED TO CLEAN HARBORS OF NATICK WHERE IT WILL BE UTIMATELY DISPOSED OF AT A PROPERLY LICENSED DISPOSAL FACILITY. THERE WERE NO INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT NOR WAS THERE ANY DAMAGE TO THE TRUCK STOP.  IN ORDER TO PREVENT THIS INCIDENT FROM RECURRING, CLEAN HARBORS OF NATICK HAS PROVIDED REFRESHER TRAINING AND INSTRUCTION TO ALL FIELD PERSONNEL WHO HANDLE POTENTIALLY REACTIVE MATERIALS.

CONTACTED TIER, INC. ABOUT CLEANUP AND DISPOSAL OF SPENT SULFURIC ACID RESIDUES RESULTING FROM AN OVER-TURNED TRACTOR TRAILER CONTAINING THIS MATERIAL.  TIER WAS CONTRACTED BY QUADREL BROS. TO CONDUCT A SITE ASSESSMENT OF THE AREA AFFECTED AND COMPLETE THE CLEANUP OF ANY SPILLED SPENT SULFURIC ACID REMAINING AT THE SITE. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH MIKE RYBACKI FO PADER TO MEET AT THE SITE OF THE SPILL, WHICH WAS 1/2 MILE SOUTH OF THE WOODHAVEN EXIT ON I-95 SOUTH ON FEBRUARY 28, 1992. MIKE RYBACKI REQUESTED PH READING OF THE SOIL IN THE AFFECTED AREA OF THE SPILL AND FROM AN ADJACENT AREA FOR A BACKGROUND READING.  SOIL PH READINGS WERE OBTAINED USING A MODEL HB-2 KELWAY SOIL TESTER. CONTAMINATION WAS LIMITED TO SURFACE AND SHALLOW SUB-SURFACE SOIL VISUALLY CONTAMINATED WITH A DARK COLORED GREASE BASED SLUDGE.  THIS MATERIAL WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE SPENT SULFURIC ACID SLUDGE BY ITS LOW PH READING. ALL SOIL PH READINGS TAKEN FROM LOCATIONS ADJACENT TO THE VISUALLY CONTAMINATED AREA WERE NORMAL.  SEE ATTACHMENT A FOR LOCATION OF CONTAMINATRED AREA AND ADJACENT SOIL PH READINGS. ONCE THE CONTAMINATED AREA HAD BEEN DEFINED, TIER PROCEEDED TO MANUALLY REMOVE AND DRUM THE SPENT SULFURIC ACID SLUDGE AND SURROUNDING SOILS.  THE AMOUNT OF CONTAMINATION TO BE REMOVED EXCEEDED THE CAPACITY OF DRUMS BROUGHT BY TIER PERSONNEL.  ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO RETURN THE FOLLOWING WEEK WITH A SMALL EXCAVATOR AND ADDITIONAL DRUMS AND PLASTIC LINERS TO COMPLETE REMOVAL AND DRUMMING OF SPENT SULFURIC ACID SLUDGE AND ASSOCIATED SOILS. ON MARCH 3, 1992 TIER RETURNED TO COMPLETE THE REMOVAL AND DRUMMING OF SPENT SULFURIC ACID SLUDGE FROM THIS SITE.  IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT 15-20 GALLONS OF ACID WAS SPILLED AT THIS SITE BEFORE FINAL CLEAN-UP WAS INITIATED.  THIS 15-20 GALLONS APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN AN ACCURATE ESTIMATION OF MATERIAL SPILLED.  FIVE (5) 55 GALLON DRUMS WERE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF THIS PROJECT.  THE FIVE DRUMS WERE STAGED ON THE SHOULDER OF I-95 SOUTH TO AWAIT PICKUP AT A LATER DATE. MIKE RYBACKI OF PADER REQUESTED SOIL SAMPLING OF THE CONTAMINATED AREA TO CONFIRM CLEANUP.  THREE (3) SOIL SAMPLES WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE SURFACE TO 1' OF DEPTH IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE CONTAMINATED AREA AND ANALYZED FOR TOTAL PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS (TPH).  SOIL SAMPLES WERE CONTAINED IN 500 ML JARS WITH TEFLON-LINED LIDS AND PRESERVED IN ICE TO AWAIT PICKUP BY LANCASTER LABORATORIES.  TOTAL PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS WERE NOT DETECTED IN ANY OF THE SOIL SAMPLES.  SEE ATTACHEMENT B FROM COPIES OF ANALYTICAL RESULTS AND WHERE THESE SAMPLES WERE EXTRACTED AT THE SITE. THE FIVE (5) DRUMS OF SPENT SULFURIC SLUDGE AND SOIL WERE TRANSPORTED AND DISPOSED AS A NON-HAZARDOUS SOLID BY DELAWARE CONTAINER CO. ON MARCH 10, 1992.
