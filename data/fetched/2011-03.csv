CSXT spotted this railcar at the plant's unloading rack approximately one hour prior to discovery of the release. BP Products contacted CSXT for assistance in securing the tank car. Harry Hopes, a CSXT Hazardous Materials Manager, was dispatched to the scene and found the product dripping from the connection between the bottom outlet valve and the tank car. Attempts to secure the leak were unsuccessful therefore arrangements were made to transfer the product into BP Products storage tanks. The shipper, Poet Biorefining, obtained an FRA Movement Approval FRA-11030164 to forward the tank car to Union Tank Car in Valdosta, Georgia for repairs.

The car was isolated and the shipper, BP Amoco Chemical Company, was notified via CHEMTREC Report 2011-03-04-00202.  HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found product dripping from the bottom outlet cap. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Greg Crum at 630-420-5018. HEPACO personnel removed the auxiliary valve plug and opened the line to drain the trapped product into a container. HEPACO personnel were unsuccessful at tightening the bottom outlet cap.  Since the trapped product was removed between the main and auxiliary valve, the rail car was temporarily secured. The shipper was informed that an FRA Movement Approval would be required to forward the car to destination due to the defective bottom outlet valve.    On 3/9/2011 at 15:00 hrs., personnel in the CSXT / Carolina Public Railway's State Junction Interchange yard discovered TILX 200244, leaking from the bottom of the car for the second time. The car was isolated and the shipper, BP Amoco Chemical Company, was notified via CHEMTREC Report 2011-03-09-00177. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Greg Crum at 630-420-5018. HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and installed a haz hammock under the bottom outlet valve. On 3/16/2011 the shipper contracted emergency response contractors, Eagle/SWS, to transfer the product into tank trucks.    This incident did not require a special switching move.

He was driving a 2007 Mack Granite, tri-axle auger truck carrying two types of blasting agent.  They were UN0331 and UN0332.  The driver stated he was meeting another truck (loaded with rock) that was sightly on the center line in a curve when he moved over as close to the shoulder of the road as he could to avoid a head on collision when his right front tire dropped off the shoulder of the road way.  He attempted to steer back on to the roadway when the vehicle skidded and over turned.  The driver assessed the situation for personal injuries and contacted emergency personnel and then his supervisor.  State Police, EMS, DOT/Vehicle Enforcement, State Fire Marshal, EPA, Ambulance, State Highway Dept as well as local athorities were notified.  Each responder began their investigation and then clean up began.  Spilled product was contained and did not enter into a water way or stream.  Residents in the immediate area were notified and evacuated for precautionary measures.  Carrier notified the NRC Hotline and filed report as per required.",Road way in this area is very narrow.  This driver as well as other drivers will be trained as to watch for other oncoming traffic and narrow roadways.  Training methods will include slowing to a safe speed to meet conditions of particular road ways and possibly turning on hazard warning lights in these areas.

During the course of the trip, the drive conducted a routine load check and discovered a small amount of material coming from the rear door of the vacuum box container. The driver immediately placed a containment pail under the rear door and contacted his home dispatcher to request a response crew. Upon notification, a Clean Harbors response crew was dispatched to the scene where the response crew added a binder chain which stopped the leak: a containment diaper was secured to the vacuum box as an added measure. The NY DEC was notified  (Officer Andy Frank) to obtain permission to transport the Vacuum box to the Clean Harbors Glenmont NY Facility to transfer the material into a Tanker for contuinued transportation to intended disposal facility. Officer Franks granted Clean Harbors permission to conduct this procedure. The tanker was escorted by the spill team to ensure the container remained secure back to the Glenmont facility.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking or damage was observed. Upon inspection at the Clean Harbors Glenmont NY facility it  was determined the vacuum box was leaking from the a comprimised gasket.

He then proceeded to connect a 2"" chemical unloading hose to the intermediate bulk container,(IBC) to be offloaded and the unloading pump. (2) 2"" chemical hoses were then connected to the outlet of the unloading pump to the customers receiving tank. The employee secured all hose connections with Velcro straps. Upon receiving approval to begin the offloading process the employee activated the offloading pump by engaging the air, and opened the IBC valve. The employee then observed all connections to ensure there were no leaks.  The employee transferred (3) IBCs to the customers receiving tank to complete the delivery. While the employee was disconnecting the chemical hoses an employee of the customer informed the driver that he had HCL leaking on the ground. At this time the driver noticed the last tote he transferred had leaked product which ran behind the valve onto the trailer floor towards the front of the trailer due to the vehicle being parked on a decline. The driver then proceeded to clean up the area affected by the release. The recovered material was containerized for subsequent disposal. The driver returned the transport vehicle to the shipping facility for further examination.  All the hoses used in the transfer process were inspected. (1) hose that was connected to the valve of the IBC was found to have a compromised gasket. The hose was then connected to the tote which had leaked to determine if there was a proper connection. The hose was able to spin freely on the valve connection indicating the gasket had been compromised. The IBC was DOT tested on 3/28/11 to verify the leak had not occurred due to gasket failure in the valve and passed.",To prevent future occurrences all employees who perform bulk unloading processes were instructed to changed hose gaskets when they perform their monthly hose inspections. The employees were also instructed to inspect all hose gaskets prior to any bulk unloading and replace if the visual inspection of the gasket expressed and damage or compromises.

The duration of the spill is undetermined as the start time of the hose failure resulting in the spilled material is unknown.  At 10:35A, Ranger, Georgia Branch Manager, Jim Novak, called Mike Gentry with ADC to access the situation and see what further assistance was needed, if any.  At first, Mr. Novak was informed that the spill involved approximately 50 gallons of sodium hypochlorite which had been contained and was being pumped to an intermediate bulk container.  At 12:05P, Mr. Ellis, the driver, called the TSUI Ranger, Georgia dispatch to report unloading operations were continuing as the cargo tanker unloading hose had been repaired.  However, Mr. Ellis noted that per his estimation, 1027 gallons of sodium hypochlorite had been released, not 50 gallons, of which 275 gallons was contained and reclaimed to the intermediate bulk container.  Mr. Novak and Mr. Gentry resumed their conversation, and Mr. Gentry informed Mr. Novak that the spilled sodium hypochlorite had flowed from the parking lot into a drainage area, which had receive heavy rains and stormwater runoff the previous evening,  where the material was pooling.  Using a kit to test the available chlorine (i.e. pool test kit), Mr. Gentry determined the pooled material in the drainage area was less than 3% available sodium hypochlorite.  Based upon this conversation and discussion with senior company management, TSUI contacted its insurance carrier, Chartis, to dispatch a hazardous material/environmental clean-up crew to evaluate the scene and address remediation concerns.  ADC, under the instruction of the local Emergency Management Agency/Fire Response, instructed ADC to neutralize the spilled material by applying a non-hazardous material (calcium thiosulfate).  Once neutralization was completed, it was determined by the Emergency Management Agency/Fire Response, no further action was needed.  At 6:30P, Eagle SWS, environmental contractor contacted by Chartis, arrived at the scene and conducted their own assessment, including pH testing and briefing from ADC regarding actions taken to mitigate/neutralize the spill (including the instructions of the Emergency Management Agency/Fire Response).  At 7:13P, all parties agreed that the necessary actions had been taken to mitigate the spill of sodium hypochlorite with further pH monitoring of the area over the next several days.  When cargo tanker returned to the TSUI Ranger, Georgia facility, it was determined through weight/trip reports that 1095 gallons of 12.5% by weight sodium hypochlorite (UN1791) had been lost from the cargo ta",1)Investigat further to determine actual cause of split and reason for quantity loss when source of failure was a two inch slit.  2)Driver immediately put on suspension pending investigation for not following procedures for off loading  3)Investigate why spill was reported as such a small quantity at beginning of response  4)Investigate why spill was over RQ with a 2 inch slit in the hose,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,4282,Allied Universal Corp,US,

The car was isolated in the rail yard away from CSXT employees and the shipper, Norfalco Sales Inc., was notified thru Canadian Emergency contact 1-613-996-6666 no report number was given. HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the liquid line cap was loose, allowing product to spill on to the rail car. The issue was identified and corrective actions were  communicated to the shipper's representative, Louie Adin 819-763-6153. HEPACO took the liquid line cap off, checked the threads, replaced the cap and tightened it with a pipe wrench. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

Most likely the Florida Rock driver had not properly hooked up the coupling to the hose and therefore causing the approximately 10 gallons to leak onto the concrete and running to the nearby soil. We have removed the asphalt and soil that was affected by the spill. Clean soil and asphalt have been place at the site.

The responders properly tool tightened all manway securement bolts (3 bolts at 1/2 turn and 3 bolts at 1/4 turn to achieve a tool tight condition). Afterwards, product odor/vapor dissipated.

Only product odor vapors were release. PHMSA DOT reporting system defects will not allow reporting release in units other than what is used for reporting capcity. Therefore this vapor odor release was reported as 0.1 gallon to make the PHMSA DOT system accept report.    Item 27, amount in package, was estimated by preparer. This action was required to facilitate data acceptance by defective PHMSA DOT IT system edits. Specifically, this estimated quantity was required for two reasons:   (1)because the shipper only provided bulk quantity on shipping paper, as 1 Tank Car, per PHMSA DOT requirements; and   (2)because the PHMSA DOT e-system requires data in this field which match the same units of measure as found in the capacity field.   KCS will continue to report in this fashion unit instructed differently by DOT or PHMSA.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

The IMTT Operator immediately shut down the operation.  IMTT personnel used absorbant pads to wipe down the outside of the trailer compartment and placed pads on the impacted areas of the loading rack.  Arrangments were made to pump back the excess product from the trailer compartment to the appropriate storage tank.  Once the product level in the trailer was at safe fill, the trailer was released.",After a thorough investigation IMTT determined that the overfill was caused by a combination of human error on the part of the IMTT Operator and a malfunction of the electronic meter on the loading rack.

Dangerous Goods Specialists Spahija and Perez performed an investigation and determined that one (1), 50-gallon steel drum had been that there was a scratch on the bottom of the drum causing leaking. The drum was nicely shrink-wrapped to the skid and it is believed that the scratch happened when the drum was shrink-wrapped to the skid. Dangerous Goods Specialists Spahija and Perez applied absorbent towels to the scratch in the drum and to the affected area on the floor.

There was a chemical smell inside the trailer when the door was opened. No way to determine how the tote sustained the damage, but was probably struck by something. The crack was on the top of the tote, above the fluid line inside. Spillage only occured when the liquid content was sloshed around during transport. A very small amount of corrosive liquid leaking though the crack coagulated around the crack and gelled on the side of the tote. The leak was so small that I am unable to measure the content loss. Chemtrec was notified, report 2011032400130. Peter Ramsey of Nalco Safety, the shipper was contacted. Harvey Kruger at Hecla Mining, the consignee, was called.

Driver stated the unloading hose failed, developed a leak in the hose leading to the spraying of sodium hypochlorite in the immediate area.  Driver immediately discontinued the unloading of sodium hypochlorite from cargo tanker upon discovery of the leak.  It was determined about fifteen (15) gallons of sodium hypochlorite product was released from the hose failure point to the ground and onto a parked vehicle.  Vehicle was rinsed with water by the TSUI driver.  The owner of the property called the Fire Department.  The Fire Department responded to the scene, placing absorbent material in front of the storm/sewer drains.  They also assisted with removing the remaining sodium hypochlorite material in the unloading hose and flushing the area with water.  The Fire Department notified the Florida State Warning Point (report number SWP110325-1660), but incorrectly identified the material as liquid chlorine.  A Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) officer was dispatched to the scene (# BER 2011-3I-44975).  It was determined that an environmental contractor, Cliff Berry, would handle all remaining remediation required by the FDEP.  Water and sodium hypochlorite came into contact with oil marks/stains on the surface prior to flowing to the soil.  FDEP officer noted due to the mixture of oil, additional clean-up actions were required.","The delivery site may have caused the hose failure.  The hose has to be “dragged” under a chain link fence in order to connect to the above ground storage tank for unloading.  Dragging across surface and chain link fence may have damaged hose causing failure.

Driver states that he had been unloading the sodium hypochlorite for approximately 10 – 15 minutes when he noticed a puddle of liquid around a section of the hose.  With his personal protection equipment on he approached this area to investigate what this liquid was and why it was there and detected a bleach smell.  He at once shut down his unloading process and blew out the product left in the line into the customer’s tank.  He noticed that there was a pin hole in the hose which was causing it to slowly leak sodium hypochlorite on the ground.  At 0315, following our safety procedures the driver called Allied Universal Corp. Branch Manager, Randy Bunkley notifying him of this leak and that he was going to use the hose off his tanker to complete that unloading process.  At this time the small amount of sodium hypochlorite, which had leaked out, had already soaked into the ground.  The driver could not wash down the area because the customer did not have water available at this site.  The main water is shut off nightly.",THE STATIONARY HOSE THAT WAS AT THE CUSTOMER SITE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE BRANCH AND REPLACED WITH A NEW HOSE,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Allied Universal Corp,US,

While travelling on Oklahoma Highway 3, near Sara Road, the tractor-tanker unit was involved in a vehicle accident.  Apparently the accident resulted as a result of a vehicle pulling out in front of the tractor-tanker unit.  The tractor-tanker unit hit the vehicle on the passenger side of the car and the unit rolled over and into a ditch on the side of the road.  The unit was hauling approximately 6500 gallons of unleaded gasoline and 1500 gallons of diesel fuel.  As a result of the accident, and rollover the unit caught on fire.  The Oklahoma City Fire Department and the Oklahoma City Police Department responded to assess the site.  The Oklahoma City Fire Department extinguished the fire and constructed a berm to contain the water and fuel.  Sisk Environmental of Yukon, Oklahoma was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Sisk Environmental performed a site investigation and confirmed that no product had reached any surface waters.  Sisk Environmental recovered the free product on the impacted roadway and completed site excavation as needed.","Since the release was accidental, and was the result of a vehicle accident, no actions have been taken to prevent recurrence.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,139786,SPILL CENTER INC.,US,

The Master, K. W. Nerurkar reported the leak to the shipping line Hapag Lloyd. Hapag Lloyd reported the incident to the USCG, Georgia Port Authority (GPA) and CBP and requested that the USCG attend the vessel, on arrival in Savannah.

The vessel arrived in Savannah, GA, on 4 April 2011 at 21:00 hours.The Chief Officer of the vessel, C. S. Aranjo reported the following: ""Deck crew were involved in checking lashings. During the Operation the leaking liquid was seen coming out of the container which had IMDG placards. Immediately they informed the Chief Officer, on the bridge. Work in the area was stopped , container contents checked from the IMDG manifest and EMS was checked. The area was then cordoned off using sand and reports were sent."" The USCG boarded the vessel and determined that the container should be discharged and isolated, so that it's contents could be examined. At 00:10 on 5 April the container was discharged from the vessel and isolated in a area near row 608 in Garden City Terminal. The USCG, a representative from the GPA, a GPA Police officer, NCB, and Eagle SWS were present at the containers opening. The following conditions were noted by B. Parrish of NCB : ""A pallet ofdrums shifted in the container due to improper securing. The drums inverted and leaked around the lids, but were not punctured. The contents of the container were removed by SWS, and all spilled cargo was cleaned and removed.The drums were returned to the container and properly secured. The USCG observed and approved the operation,and the container was accepted by the vessel based on their approval. P.O.C. for the USCG was PO2 Mudrock (912) 210-2249.""

California Highway Patrol responded to the site.  Originally, it was reported to have involved a minimal release of non-regulated floor cleaner.  Patriot Environmental Services of Etiwanda, California was dispatched to offload trailer, containerize leaker, and send load on its way.  However, upon inspection of trailer, it was determined that various commodities had been damaged, and multiple products had released.  Majority of products were shipped as miscellaneous hardware, non-regulated, and/or consumer commodity.  Upon arrival on site, a minimal amount of product was discovered on the asphalt roadway, majority of damaged freight and spilled product were contained inside the trailer.  During offload of freight, it was determined that approximately 8 gallons of muriatic acid, 10 gallons of water-based paint related material, and 4 gallons of roofing tar were released.  Damaged unrecoverable freight consisted of eight (8) 1-gallon plastic pails of muriatic acid, 20-25 pails of water based paint ranging from 1-pint to 1-gallon, and two (2) 5-gallon metal pails of roofing tar.  All damaged product was containerized, trailer and asphalt roadway were cleaned, and remaining freight was repalletized.  Seven (7) 55-gallon drums of waste were transported off site, pending disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  There were no injuries or exposures as a result of the incident.","Since the release was accidental, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

During the course of loading his trailer, the driver moved the vehicle from the loading site to an on site scale in order to determine available capacity within the tank.  Prior to moving the vehicle, the driver failed to adequately secure the dome hatch on the vehicle which allowed approximately 30 – 50 gallons of material to escape onto the roadway within the confines of the Consolidated Edison property.  Upon realization of the release, representatives from Consolidated Edison initiated both internal and external notifications.  The driver also contacted his home dispatcher and a response crew was assembled and sent to the scene.  Upon arrival, the decision was made to transfer the contents of the trailer to an alternative vehicle to facilitate the disposal of the material and the decontamination of the trailer involved in the spill.  This transfer was accomplished without incident.  Response crews then proceeded to remediate the affected area  that included the deployment of a suitable absorbent, recovery of all spill debris and decontamination and cleaning of all affected surfaces.  All material collected in response to this event was containerized and sent for disposal to a fully licensed waste management facility.","An internal investigation was conducted and it was determined that the cause of this release was direclty related to the failure of the driver to secure the cloisures on his vacuum trailer.  As a result of his failure to conduct this basic driver duty, the driver was terminated for cause.  In addition, the local service center prepared an internal incident alert highlighting the factors that led to the release and was reviewed with the operating team involved in this operation.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,20000,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

Once the pumping was complete the material appeared to be dry and in proper condition for transportation. The roll-off box was transported to the Heritage Transport, LLC 10-day in Indianapolis, IN and arrived on March 16, 2011.  The box was dropped in the 10-Day without any incident or release of materials on March 16, 2011.

Dripping about 30 drips per minute. Car was isolated to old intermodal ramp track and blue flagged by car department for emergency response. Qualified hazmat responder, Hazmat Response, Inc., was mobilized. Investigation found the flange gasket connection of the bottom outlet valeve to the tank shell leaking. Attempts were made to tighten this connection, but it was found tool tight. The tank car was off loaded to highway cargo tanks and lading was delivered via rubber tire mode. The bottom outlet valve was removed by the shipper and repairs were made to the gasket connection. The shipper performed successful qualified leak test. The car was then home shopped for follow up analysis.     F5800 Report Notes:  Item 27, amount in package, was estimated by preparer. This action was required to facilitate data acceptance by defective PHMSA DOT IT system edits. Specifically, this estimated quantity was required for two reasons:   (1)because the shipper only provided bulk quantity on shipping paper, as 1 Tank Car, per PHMSA DOT requirements; and   (2)because the PHMSA DOT e-system requires data in this field which use the same units of measure as found in the capacity field.   KCS will continue to report in this fashion unit instructed differently by DOT or PHMSA.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.
