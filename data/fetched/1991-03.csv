SO, WE WAITED FOR THE FOAM TO SUBSIDE.  WHEN IT DID, THE AREA INSIDE THEIR TRAINING WALL AROUND THE STORAGE TANK WAS FULL AND HAD OVERFLOWED INTO THE RETAINING AREA ADJACENT TO IT.  WE WERE THEN TOLD TO FINISH UNLOADING AND WAIT FOR A REPRESENTATIVE FROM B.C WILLIAMS INC. (BART ARREN) WHO WAS TO HELP US FIND THE SOLUTION TO CLEANING UP THE MESS.  WE FINISHED UNLOADING, SHUT DOWN, CLEANED AND PUT AWAY OUR EQUIPMENT, THEN WAITED FOR BART,  WHEN BART ARRIVED, IT WAS DETERMINED HOW MUCH PRODUCT WAS LOST (APPROXIMATELY 175 GALLONS).  THEN WE ALL DISCUSSD THE PROBLEM AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS.  AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION AND SEVERAL PHONE CALLS, WE ALL AGREED THAT THE BEST SOLUTION WOULD BE TO PUMP THE LOST PRODUCT BACK INTO THE TRAILER AND RETURN IT TO B.C. WILLIAMS INC.  SO I CALLED OUR TERMINAL MANAGER (EDDIE WILLARD) AND RELATED ALL PRIOR EVENTS TO HIM AND TOLD HIM ABOUT THE FINAL DECISION.
