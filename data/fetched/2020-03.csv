Following a site assessment, FC personnel noted two(2) 5-gallon pales of UN1263 were damaged due to a load shift and released approximately 10 gallons to the trailer floor. Crews utilized a fork lift to safely remove the contents of the trailer to complete remediation. As items were moved out, they were wiped clean of any residual product. FC personnel deployed a neutralizing agent to the release liquid. Once neutralized, granular absorbents were deployed and worked in using hand tools.

The car was isolated and Eastman Chemical was notified.  CHEMTREC report# 2020-032100085. Hepaco, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the pressure relief valve leaking. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Tony Nicks 314-413-7339. Contractor personnel applied a Midland Kit to the pressure relief device, as attempts at replacing the O-rings failed stop the vapor release. 03-31-2020 Hepaco conducted a transfer and clean and purge of UTLX 903507.

It was reported to the yard master and while I was out of town I, John Vergis Hazardous Materials/Environmental Officer for the WLE, had the car set to the shop for further investigation.  When I got on top the car I had seen that a small amount of Asphalt did release from the Manway Lid.  I removed Seal Number 0333999 from the Manyway Lid to prepare for opening the Lid.  I then removed seal number 0333997 from the Breadbox lid so that i could vent the car before opening the Manyway Lid.  I opened the Manyway Lid and found that the Manway gasket had about a 1/2 inch peice missing from it which is what cause it to leak.  I replaced the gasket and secured the lid and installed new seal 971765.  I then secured the vapor valve inside the breadbox since I used it to vent the car and then installed new Seal 971768 on the lid after closing it.  I then released the car for transportation.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Southern States Chemical, was notified via CHEMTREC Report #2020-0308-00034.  Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and confirmed the car was leaking from the pressure relief vent assembly.  MEI found the rupture disc retaining was not installed, the surge protection sleeve and rupture disc were not present, and noted a crack in the vent assembly.  Contractor personnel installed a rupture disc and secured the rupture disc retaining ring to stop the release.

During this inspection, a trailer was found to have a black liquid pool underneath. Upon further inspection and investigation, it was determined that a fiberboard IBC container from Halstab was leaking 3-5 gallons of black liquid.  1. The spill was cleaned up internally.  2. The liquid inside the fiberboard IBC was absorbed using corn-cob absorbent. This changed the liquid state of the material into a solid state. 3. The hazardous solids, including those generated from the clean-up, were repackaged into a new fiberboard IBC. Since this material was solidified, the fiberboard IBC was an appropriate container type.",It was determined that the material shipped was too wet for the container that it was shipped in.

It was discovered that the railcar was leaking from the SALCO non resetting Vent vale on the top of the rail car. The car was isolated and Solvay Fluorides was notified by (CHEMTREC 2020032500094). The conductor received medical treatment at the scene and was transported to the hospital for evaluation and released. HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the tank car was leaking from SALCO Vent valve. Upon inspection the valve was found to be disassembled with the rupture disk and baffle missing. the surge protector was found intact on the ground laying near the rail cars.The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Kyle Vandermolen 913-242-1187. Contractor personnel temporarily secured the railcar that will require that the SALCO valve be replaced and the railcar bubble leak test be performed by a MRU prior to being released to transportation.

The tote was punctured by the metal cage that secures the bladder in the upper right hand comer causing a 2-3 inch gash. This allowed material to leak onto the shoulder of Mission Ave. The duration of the release was less than 10 minutes as we were able to dispatch additional employees from our location less than a mile away to pull the tote upright and use commercial spill kits to contain the material to a 3x6 foot area. Patriot Environmental Services were called and dispatched to the scene to handle the clean up and disposal of contaminated soil.,"Immediately following this incident the shipping facility operations manager held an all manager/driver meeting to discuss DOT Hazardous Material training specifically the section regarding Load Securement under 49 CFR Part 177.834 and Subpart I(49 CFR Part 393). In addition to securing ALL loads, a refresher of Pre-trip Safety inspections, loading and unloading, SDS/ERG books, and Incident reporting was completed.

Impacted soil was excavated, containerized in lined roll- off containers, and transported to the designated disposal facility in Deer Park, TX for disposal.  The area was restored to pre-existing conditions.   The release was reported to the National Response  Center at 17:39 hours on 03-01-2020.
