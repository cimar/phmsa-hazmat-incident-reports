THE CARRIER RETAINED A CLEAN UP CONTRACTOR TO RESPOND TO THE SITE TO LOCATE AND SECURE THE LEAKING PACKAGE(S), AND TO CONDUCT ANY NEEDED SITE REMEDIATION.  AS THE LEAKING MATERIAL WAS THEN UNKNOWN, THE CONTRACTOR INITIALLY WORKED IN LEVEL ""A"" PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.  AS THE TEMPERATURE WAS 102 DEGREES THEY WERE LIMITED TO WORKING IN 15 MINUTE INCREMENTS.  THE CONTRACTOR PLACED ABSORBENT PADS ON TO THE GROUND TO SOAK UP THE SPILLED PRODUCT, AND ALSO USED BUCKETS TO CATCH PRODUCT DRIPPING FROM TRAILER UPON OPENING DOOR. SOME PRODUCT LEAKED INTO A DITCH ALONG THE REST STOP PAVEMENT. THERE WAS A POOL OF PRODUCT ABOUT A FOOT WIDE THAT NEEDED TO BE CLEANED UP IN THAT AREA.  THE PRODUCT THAT WAS FOUND TO BE LEAKING WAS ABOUT 3/4 OF THE WAY UP IN THE TRAILER.  THE PRODUCT WAS IN A PLASTIC 55 GALLON DRUM LEAKING FROM A HOLE THAT RESULTED FROM A SHIFT OF THE FREIGHT TO THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER.  THERE WAS AN APPROXIMATE LOSS  OF 40 GALLONS OF THIS PRODUCT.  SEVERAL OTHER DRUMS WERE LYING ON THEIR SIDES.  THE DRUMS WERE ON PALLETS AND POORLY SHRINK WRAPPED.

IT WAS LOADED IN THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER.  THIS CREATED A VOID SPACE.  THE SHIPPER LOADED THE PALLETS OF DRUMS BEHIND IT WITH NO OTHER SECUREMENT PROVIDED.  THE OTHER SHIPMENTS WERE LOADED AT THE CARRIER'S FACILITY, BEHIND THE ORIGINAL SHIPMENT.  DURING TRANSIT, THE SHRINK WRAP ON AT LEAST ONE OF THE ORIGINAL PALLETS FAILED, LEAVING ITS DRUMS ADRIFT.

THE AREA WAS SECURED WHILE THE LIQUID WAS NEUTRALIZED, AND THEN ABSORBED FOR PLACEMENT INTO DRUMS. THE RESIDUE ON THE RAILCAR WAS ALSO CLEANED SO THE EQUIPMENT COULD BE REUSED FOR FUTURE LOADING.

DEVELOPED AN OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR, EXTRA TANK LINES, WAS LOADING JET FUEL INTO A THE ABOVE TANK CAR, WHICH CONTAINED HYDROCHLORIC ACID.  DURING THIS PROCESS, 2 EMPLOYEES OF EXTRA TANK LINES, WERE OVER COME WITH FUMES AND WERE TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL.  THERE WAS A REPORTED LEAK, BUT IT WAS NOT KNOWN IF THE LEAK WAS FROM THE TANK CAR OR THE TANK TRUCKS.  A TRACK LIST SHOWED THE VARIOUS TANK CARS ON SPOT, HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHICH CAR WAS INVOLVED.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD CLOSED OFF THE AREA AND WAS EVACUATING THE TOWN OF YERMO NEAR CALICO STREET AND YERMO ROAD.  MANAGER COOPER RAN ALL THE TANK CARS ON THE TRACK LIST, AND FOUND ONLY THE ABOVE CAR TO HAVE ANY PREVIOUS MOVES WITH THE ACID PRODUCT.  THE CAR NUMBER WAS SUPPLIED TO THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, HOW EVER, IT COULD NOT BE CONFIRMED AS THE CAR INVOLVED. MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO YERMO, AND MET WITH ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT.  DEVELOPED EXTRA HAD LOADED 3 TRUCK LOADS OF THE JET FUEL INTO THE ABOVE TANK CAR WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THIS CAR WAS NOT ON THEIR LIST FOR LOADING.  AS THE CAR WAS OWNED BY JONES HAMILTON, A SALT LAKE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CODY GROUP CONTACTED JONES HAMILTON REQUESTING THE USE OF THE CAR TO TRANSPORT THE FUEL.  JONES HAMILTON ADVISED THE CODY GROUP THEY COULD NOT USE THE CAR AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO REMOVE THE FUEL. WHILE IN THE PROCESS OF REMOVING THE FUEL FROM THE TANK CAR, THE OPERATORS WERE ALSO REMOVING THE ESTIMATED 25 - 30 GALLON HEEL OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID. THE ACID ATE THROUGH THE ALUMINUM PIPING ON THE TANK TRUCK AND RELEASED THE RESIDUE ACID AND FUEL ONTO THE GROUND BELOW THE TANK TRUCK.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 3000 GALLONS OF JET FUEL AND  LESS THAN 25 GALLONS OF HYDROCHLORIC WAS RELEASED.  THE 2 EXTRA DRIVERS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THE OFF LOADING, SHUT THE PUMP DOWN, AND DROVE THEMSELVES TO THE VICTOR VALLEY HOSPITAL.  ONCE EVERYTHING WAS SORTED OUT, A TEST OF THE LIQUID IN THE ABOVE TANK CAR WAS COMPLETED WHICH SHOWED THE PH LEVEL TO BE AROUND 1.8. IT WAS ESTIMATED THE TANK CAR CONTAINED ROUGHLY 17,000 GALLONS OF JET FUEL MIXED WITH THE RESIDUE ACID.  IN ORDER TO OFF LOAD THE LIQUID FROM THE TANK AND TRANSPORT IT FOR DISPOSAL, THE PRODUCT HAD TO BE TREATED.  THE PH WAS LOW ENOUGH TO TRANSPORT IN A RUBBER LINED TRUCK, HOWEVER, THE JET FUEL WOULD ATTACK THE RUBBER LINING.  IF A STAINLESS TRUCK WERE TO BE USED TO TRANSPORT THE JET FUEL PORTION, THE ACID WOULD ATTACK THE METAL.  SODA ASH WAS BROUGHT IN, ADDED TO THE PRODUCT, AND DISPERSED WITH A MAKE SHIFT AIR WAND.  THIS BROUGHT THE PH LEVEL UP TO 5.  THE 2 ORIGINAL TANK TRUCKS WERE DECONED AND MOVED OFF THE SITE FOR CLEAN OUT.  EXCAVATION OF THE SPILL AREA BEGAN, AND ALL THE CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS PLACED INTO ROLL OFF BINS FOR STORAGE PENDING THE PROFILLING FOR DISPOSAL.  THE FOLLOWING DAY, TRUCKS WERE BROUGHT IN TO OFF LOAD THE PRODUCT FROM THE TANK CAR, HOWEVER, WHEN T",,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,0,,US,

WE WERE GOING ALONG HWY 218. WE CAME OVER THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND STARTED DOWN HILL AT ABOUT 35 MPH. THE ROAD WAS WINDING. AT AROUND 12:30 BARRY ASKED ME TO PULL OVER SO WE MIGHT CHECK THE MAP. AT THAT TIME I WAS DOING 40 MPH. I SAW A SHOULDER AND WENT TO PULL OFF. BUT THE BRAKES DID NOT SEEM TO GRAB MUCH. THEN I SAW PRESSURE GAUGE WAS ALMOST AT 60 PSI, THEN IT CAME ON. WE STILL CONTINUED DOWN MOUNTAIN TRYING TO SLOW DOWN AND STAY IN CONTROL. I DOWN SHIFTED AND ENGINE REDLINED AND AIR PRESSURE DID NOT BUILD. I CONTINUED TO STAB BRAKE. AT ABOUT 55-60 MPH THE PRESSURE DROPPED TO BELOW 30 PSI AND THE BRAKES CAME ON. I SAW SMOKE POURING OUT OF THE REAR WHEELS. I WAS LOSING CONTROL OF TRUCK. I CHOOSE TO GO LEFT INTO HILL RIGHT OVER RAVINE.  WE HIT MOUNTAIN THEN TRUCK CLIMBED ABOUT 40-45 FEET UP THE HILL WHERE IT STOPPED. THE PICKUP HAD UNCOUPLED. THE FUEL TRUCK CAME TO A STOP FOR A SECOND THEN IT ROLLED DOWN HILL 4 TIMES AND CAME TO REST AT SIDE OF ROAD. BARRY AND I ASSESSED THE TRUCK AND NOTICED FUEL AND NOTICED FUEL LEAKING AND SMOKE COMING OFF WHEELS. WE FLAGGED DOWN A GUY AND HE CALLED 911.
