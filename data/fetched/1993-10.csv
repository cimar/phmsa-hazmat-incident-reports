IT SPLASH IN THE TRACTORS REAR VIEW MIRROR AND STOPPED THE UNIT ON THE RIGHT HAND SHOULDER.  THE DRIVER MADE SURE THAT THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL CHANCE OF SPILLAGE.  HE NOTIFIED THE TERMINAL MANAGER AND THE LOCAL POLICE WHO DETOURED NORTHBOUND TRAFFIC AROUND THE INTERSECTION.  UPON CONFERRING WITH THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL, A DECISION WAS MADE TO DILUTE THE ALREADY DRYING SPILL WITH WATER AND NEUTRALIZE IT WITH A SMALL QUANTITY OF CITRIC ACID.  THE CITRIC ACID WAS SENT TO THE SITE FORM THE DELAWARE CITY, DE TERMINAL.  ALL MATERIAL WAS NEUTRALIZED TO THE PROPER PH AND NO WASTE WAS GENERATED.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE STAINLESS STEEL FUSIBLE CAP AT THE REAR CLEAN OUT FAILED,  ALLOWING MATERIAL TO BE RELEASED FORM THE TRAILER.  THE SOLDER SECURING THE CENTER TO COME LOOSE.  IT APPEARS THAT THE CAP BEGAN FAILING SOUTH OF THE INTERSECTION.  THIS WAS THE FIRST FUSIBLE CAP FAILURE ORIOLE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED.  THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN.   1)  ALL FUSIBLE CAPS HAVE BEEN INSPECTED.  2)  ALL FUSIBLE CAPS WILL BE REPLACED BY OCTOBER 30, 1993.  SO WE WILL KNOW THE AGE OF ALL IN-SERVICE CAPS.  3)  THE INSTALLATION, WHEN POSSIBLE, OF FUSIBLE CAPS ON NIPPLES NOT INTENDED FOR THE USE OF CLEANING OR LOADING. 4)  THE RETRAINING OF ALL ORIOLE MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL IN THE PROPER INSPECTION, INSTALLATION, AND USE OF FUSIBLE CAPS AND GASKETS.  5)  THE CONTINUATION OF PURCHASING ONLY GIRARD EQUIPMENT CO.

ALSO, NOTED WAS THAT THERE WASN'T ANY ABSORBANT OR CUSHIONING MATERIAL USED AND THERE WERE NO MARKINGS OR LABELS FOUND ON THE OUTER OR INNER PACKAGINGS TO INDICATE THAT THE LIQUID WAS A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL.
