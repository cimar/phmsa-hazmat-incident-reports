IN ORDER TO AVOID A COLLISION IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE CARRIER'S DRIVER TO MAKE A PANIC STOP.  HE THEN MOVED HIS VEHICLE TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND STOPPED TO INSPECT THE LOAD.  WHEN HE DID, HE SAW LIQUID LEAKING FROM THE TRAILER.  HE IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE CARRIER'S HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SPECIALIST.  THE SPECIALIST ADVISED THE DRIVER TO OBSERVE WHERE THE LIQUID MIGHT GO AND TO PUT MATERIALS FROM HIS SPILL KIT DOWN IN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE FLOW.  AFTER DOING SO, THE DRIVER REPORTED THAT THE SPILLAGE APPEARED TO BE CONTAINED.  THE DRIVER THEN OPENED THE TRAILER DOOR.  HE REPORTED THAT THE LOAD HAD SHIFTED FORWARD BREAKING A LOGISITC BAR.

THE TRANSPORT TRAILER ACCIDENTALLY STRUCK THE BARRICADE POSTS IN FRONT OF THE FUEL DISPENSING UNITS CRACKING THE TRAILER FILL TUBES CAUSING A RELEASE OF 33 GALLONS OF GASOLINE ONTO THE STATION'S FUEL LOADING AREA.  THE INITIAL 55 GALLON ESTIMATE WAS A WORSE CASE ESTIMATE AND HAS BEEN REVISED DOWNWARD AFTER FURTHER CALCULATION OF THE FILL TUBES' VOLUMES. A PICTURE OF THE DAMAGED TRAILER IS CONTAINED IN ATTACHMENT A.  THE STORES CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE IMMEDIATELY DIALED 911, WHILE THE TRANSPORT DRIVER IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE APPROPRIATE MAP PERSONNEL.  THE PRODUCT INITIALLY PUDDLED UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK, AND THEN BEGAN MIGRATING ACROSS THE STATIONS DRIVEWAY, TOWARDS THE STREET, AND THROUGHOUT THE FUEL LOADING AREA.  THE TRANSPORT DRIVER ASSUMED A DEFENSIVE POSTURE USING APPROXIMATELY 15 ABSORBENT PADS TO HELP CONTAIN THE FREE PRODUCT FROM HEADING INTO THE STREET.  APPROXIMATELY 3 GALLONS OF PRODUCT EVENTUALLY MADE IT INTO THE STREET BUT NO PRODUCT ENTERED THE STORM SEWER SYSTEM.  THE OAK PARK FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON-SITE AND THREW DOWN TWO ABSORBENT BOOMS TO KEEP ADDITIONAL PRODUCT FROM ENTERING THE STREET.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THEN APPLIED APPROXIMATELY FIVE GALLONS OF BIOSOLVE TO THE REMAINING SPILLED PRODUCT.  THE MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET FOR BIOSOLVE IS CONTAINED IN ATTACHMENT B.  THE CONTAMINATED AREAS WERE THEN FLUSHED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT INTO A NEARBY STORM SEWER UTILIZING APPROXIMATELY 500 GALLONS OF WATER.   THE PETROLEUM IMPACTED ABSORBENT MATERIAL WAS EVENTUALLY TRANSPORTED BACK TO THE DETROIT TERMINAL FOR PRODUCT RECLAMATION AND RE-USE.  MAP'S SPILL RESPONSE TEAM BEGAN ARRIVING ON-SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 3:15 PM EST.  BY THIS TIME, THE TREATED PRODUCT HAD ALREADY BEEN FLUSHED INTO THE SEWER BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  ADDITIONALLY  AT THIS TIME, MAP PERSONNEL REQUESTED RESPONSE ASSISTANCE FROM OUR PRIMARY EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR, MARINE POLLUTION CONTROL (MPC).  MAP PERSONNEL INSPECTED THE STORM SEWER AND DID NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF A HYDROCARBON SHEEN.  A COMBUSTIBLE GAS MONITOR WAS ALSO USED TO TAKE  LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT (LEL) READINGS IN THE MANHOLE.   THERE WAS NEVER ANY GASOLINE SMELL IN THE MANHOLE, AND MONITORING DATA NEVER EXCEEDED ZERO PERCENT LEL.   RELEASE CALCULATIONS WERE MADE AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RELEASE VOLUME DID NOT EXCEED A REPORTABLE QUANTITY AND WAS NOT CONSIDERED A CERLA RELEASE. IT WAS ALSO MAP'S UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MICHIGAN PART 5 SPCC RULES DO NOT APPLY TO TRANSPORTATION RELATED EVENTS, SO THIS EVENT WAS NOT CONSIDERED REPORTABLE ACCORDING TO THOSE RULES.

FENSTERMAKER ENCOUNTERED THREE DEER CROSSING THE ROADWAY.  HE APPLIED HIS BRAKES TO AVOID THE DEER AND THE CARGO SHIFTED, JUMPING OVER THE BLOCKS HOLDING IT IN PLACE. THE DRIVER NOTICED THAT THE TRAILER DID NOT FEEL RIGHT SO HE EXITED AT RT. 193, TURNING SOUTH AND PULLING INTO THE REAR OF THE SPEEDWAY SUPER AMERICA TRUCK-STOP COMPLEX INKINGSVILLE, OHIO.  THIS IS JUST SOUTH OF THE I-90 INTERCHANGE. AT THAT TIME, HE NOTICED ODOR AND SOMELIQUID RUNNING UNDER THE CARGO TRAILER.  HE THEN REPORTED THIS TO THE DISPATCHER AT OUR FIRM. INSURED OPERATOR:  OUR OFFICES INITIALLY WERE CONTACTED TO REPORT TO THE SCENE AT 10:00 AM ON THE DATE OF LOSS. WE ARRIVED AT 11:00 AM.  AT THE TIME, THERE WERE VERY HIGH WESTERLY WINDS AND THE ODOR OF THE CHEMICAL WAS NOTICED APPROXIMATELY THREE MILES EAST OF THE SPILL. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SCENE, OUR ADJUSTER MET WITH THE KINGSVILLE, OHIO FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF, CHIP LAUGEN.  HE ADVISED THAT THE CALL ACTUALLY CAME INTO HIS OFFICE AT 1:21 AM.  THE HAZ-MET TEAM WAS IMMEDIATELY CALLED INTO SERVICE AND YOUR OFFICES HAD INLAND WATERS OF OHIO RESPOND AS WELL. EVERYONE ARRIVED SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT.  ACCORDING TO THE CHIEF, THE DRIVER REPORTED THAT THE INCIDENT OCCURRED APPROXIMATELY TWO MILES WEST OF OHIO RT 7 ON THE WESTBOUND I-90. IN AN INTERVIEW WITH YOUR DRIVER, HE ADVISED THAT HE HAD PICKED UP THE CARGO CONSISTING OF THIOGLOCOLIC ACID IN WATERLOO, NY AND WAS BOUND FOR CINCINNATI, OH. THE CARGO WAS DIVIDED INTO 15 PLASTIC  TOTES INSIDE OF METAL CAGES WITH ROOF DIMENSIONS OF 4-FT WIDE, 5-FT DEEP, 4-FT HIGH. EACH WEIGHED APPROXIMATELY 2,700 POUNDS, GIVING A TOTAL LOAD WEIGHT OF 43,497 POUNDS. ACCORDING TO THE DRIVER, THE METAL CAGES WERE SECURED BY 2X4 WOODEN PLANKS STACK TWO-HIGH, NAILED TO THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER. THE FREIGHT LOADER, WHOSE NAME WAS UNKNOWN, ASSURED THE DRIVER THAT THE 2X4'S WOULD SECURE THE LOAD.  THE DRIVER ALSO ADDED CARGO BARS TO HELP STABILIZE THE LOAD. REMEDIATION:  AS A RESULT OF THE LOSS, YOUR FIRM NOTIFIED INLAND WATERS OF OHIO TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 AM THAT MORNING.  INLAND WATERS OF OHIO IMMEDIATELY ARRIVED TO PREVENT FURTHER CONTAMINATION. YOU'LL NOTE THAT THE SPILL WAS ON A CONCRETE AREA AND WAS NOT ABSORBED INTO THE GROUND OR WATERWAYS. IT WAS ALSO DISCOVERED THAT A SMALL AMOUNT HAD LEAKED ONTO THE I-90 WESTBOUND, BUT CLEANUP WAS NOT NECESSARY. SAND AND LIME WAS SPREAD ON RT. 193. THE DRIVEWAY OF THE TRUCK STOP WAS POWER WASHED. RT.193 SOUTHBOUND AT I-90 OVERPASS AND NORTHBOUND AT THE LAST INTERSECTION BEFORE I-90 WAS CLOSED AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 AM AND TRAFFIC WAS RE-DIRECTED. CHIEF LAUGEN INFORMED THE EMPLOYEES AT THE TRUCK STOP THAT THEY MAY WANT TO CLOSE BECAUSE TRAFFIC WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN THE AREA ANYWAY.  THEY DECIDED TO STAY OPEN UNTIL 8:00 AM THAT MORNING, THEN CLOSED VOLUNTARILY. THEY WERE NOT ORDERED TO EVACUATE DUE TO HEALTH ISSUES.
