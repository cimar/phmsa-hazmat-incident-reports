OUR DRIVER HAD FINISHED HOOKING UP THE LIQUID HOSE AND WAS PREPARING TO HOOK UP THE VAPOR HOSE WHEN A DISCHARGE OF LP-GAS FROM THE VAPOR OUTLET IGNITED, RESULTING IN SEVERE BURNS TO OUR DRIVER, DAVID BOWMAN.            DAVID, PRESUMABLY IN A STATE OF SHOCK, VACATED THE AREA AND WAS ABOUT 300 YARDS WEST OF THE BULK PLANT WHEN EMERGENCY REPONSE PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.          FIREFIGHTERS SHUT OFF THE VAPOR DISCHARGE, AND MOVED THE TRANSPORT UNIT AWAY FROM THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF THE FIRE.  NO DAMAGE OCCURRED TO THE TRANSPORT UNIT AS THE FIRE SOURCE WAS THE VAPOR OUTLET ON THE UNIT.            WHEN OPENING THE INTERNAL VAPOR VALVE, I BELIEVE DAVIDS HAND HIT THE BALL SHUTOFF VALVE, WHICH LOCATED JUST BEFORE THE VAPOR OUTLET AND ADJACENT TO THE CONTROL LEVERS, OPENING BOTH THE INTERNAL VALVE AND THE BALL VALVE SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS WOULD ALLOW A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF VAPOR TO BE DISCHARGED TO THE ATMOSPHERE. DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE PIPING SYSTEM ON THE TRANSPORT, THERE CONCEIVABLY COULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH LIQUID IN THE VAPOR LINE, THAT WHEN RELEASED TO THE ATMOSPHERE COULD CREATE A STATIC DISCHARGE CAPABLE OF IGNITING THE VAPOR.  THIS LIQUID WOULD HAVE COME FROM SLOSHING AND SPRAY FILLING.                 AS A CORRECTIVE MEASURE TO PREVENT AN INCIDENT OF THIS TYPE FROM RECURRING, ALL TRANSPORT DRIVERS IN THE COMPANY WILL BE INSTRUCTED NOT TO OPEN ANY VALVES UNTIL ALL HOSES ARE CONNECTED, MAINTAINING A CLOSED SYSTEM WHICH WILL VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF IGNITION BY STATIC ELECTRICITY.",,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,1810,,US,

AFTER CONVERSING WIHT THE CUSTOMER, HE RETURNED TO THE TRUCK AND NOTICED SMALL DROPS OF MATERIAL ON THE CONCRETE. THE TRUCK WAS SITUATED AT AN ANGLE THAT PROBABLY CAUSED OUR DRIVER TO SPOT THE LEAK. JACK ENTERED THE TRAILER TO DETMINE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK AND DISCOVERED IT WAS FROM ACONTAINER NEAR THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A 230 GALLON POLY TOTE TANK HAD A HAIRLINE CRACK ON THE TOP LEFT LIP OF THE PORTABLE TANK. AFTER IDENTIFYING THE SOURE, JACK DETERMINED THAT HE COULD NOT MOVE THE TANK IN ORDER TO REPAIR THE LEAK. CHEMTREC WAS NOTIFIED BY JACK; CHEMTREC IN TURN NOTIFIED ASHLAND. ASHLAND THEN CALLED JACK AND A CONFERENCE CALL WAS MADE BETWEEN BILL OLASIN AND RANDY WLED. A PLAN OF ACTION WAS DECIDED. RANDY DISPACTCHED ANOTHER OKLAHOMA CITY DRIVER, JIM WHIPPLE, WHO CAME WITH A PALLT JACK AND EMPTY DRUMS TO HELP JACK. ONCE ALL THE DRUMS WERE MOVED SO THAT JACK AND JIM COULD GET TO THE TOTE, THEY DETERMINED THAT AN EPOXY PATCH COULD BE APPLIED. IT WAS ALSO DECIDED THAT THE TOTE WAS TRAVEL WORTHY AND THE PATCH WAS SUFFICIENT. THE KITTY LITTER THAT JACK APPLIED TO THE FLOOR OF VAN AS WELL AS THE GROUND WAS CAPTURED AND PLACED IN A DRUM. UPON INVESTIGATION, THE TOTE HAD BEEN INSPECTED AT THE GENERATOR'S LOCATION, BJ SERVICES IN MARSHALL, TEXAS. IT WAS TRANSPORTED FROM MARSHALL TO GARLAND AND THEN REMANIFESTED TO BE DISPOSED OF AT RINECO. PRIOR TO LOADING FOR TRANSPORT TO RINECO, THE TOTE WAS AGAIN INSPECTED AND NO CRACKS OR LEAKS WERE OBSERVED. BASED UPON OUR DISCUSSION CONCERNING THIS INCIDENT, THE WEATHER COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRACK. IT HAD BEEN IN THE 70'S IN DALLAS PRIOR TO SHIPMENT- THE WEATHER IN OKLAHOMA CITY WAS IN THE UPPER 20'S WHEN JACK ARRIVED. THE CUSTOMER WAS ALSO NOTIFIED AS WELL AS THE TOTE MANUFACTURER. IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS INCIDENT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PREVENTED AND I COMMEND JACK ON HIS HANDLING OF THE LEAK. I WAS NOT IN THE OFFICE THE MORNING THAT IT OCCURED- I WAS NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT ABOUT 9:30 AM AND WAS IN COMMUNICATION WITH JACK CONCERNING TH ECOURSE OF ACTION THAT WAS TAKEN.
