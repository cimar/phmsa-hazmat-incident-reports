The boxes were loaded into the truck first using a pallet jack.  The pallet jack was  left under the second box and the subsequent 55 gallon waste drums were loaded around the two  boxes.  All containers were secured in place with a cargo strap.  While backing up to the Veolia  loading dock in Fremont, CA, the load apparently shifted and one of the 55 gallon drums bumped  the corner of the pallet jack, causing a puncture.  The leak was noticed as it began dripping from  under the bed of truck cargo area.  A berm of absorbent was placed to contain the spill on the  concrete pad.  The truck was offloaded and the leaking drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon  drum within approximately 15 minutes of the leak observation.  The major portion of the leak was  contained on the truck with approximately 5 gallons that leaked onto the concrete dock area.  The  spilled material was cleaned up on the tuck and in the concrete area by Veolia.  The City of Fremont Fire Dept/CUPA was notified at 4:40 pm to the non-emergency dispatcher, badge #784.  No  response was required.",The Veolia Fremont field technicians will be trained on cargo loading and will include a hands-on  training where drivers/technicians will be presented with various scenarios of loading complications.

CSX notified CHEMTREC (report number 2019-0911-00292) and was  provided shipper contact information for Ineos USA LLC, who was notified of the incident.  HEPACO,  a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the car leaking  from the liquid valve.  The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the  shipper (Art Hurtado, phone number 630-857-7085).  Contractor personnel cleaned up the liquid  and applied new thread tape to the secondary closure plug, this stopped the release.

The product was in a tank truck and was going to be off loaded using the pump on the tractor and hoses that the driver bought with him. When the driver arrived at Cen6x to off load he inspected his hoses and gaskets and didn't notice any issues with them so he hooked them up to the pump on the tractor and starting pumping off the load. About 45 minutes into the unloading process one of the hoses developed a crack and product sprayed and poured out of the hose and onto the ground. As soon as the driver noticed this he immediately shut everything down. He then took spill pads out of his tractor and put them over the affected area where the product hit the ground. None of the product was released into any waterways and no one was injured. It is estimated that approximately 20 gallons of product leaked out of the hose. A 3rd party cleanup crew( Mac Son) was called in to clean up the spill. They used speedy dry and Vac trucks to absorb everything and then washed the area down with a vacuum truck. The defective hose was looked at when it arrived",When the driver returned to the yard we had our Maintenance Department inspect the hose that failed. We didn't notice anything out of the ordinary with the hose when we inspected it. What we believe happened here was that the hose had a small cut or gouge in it that the driver didn't see which caused it to fail when it was under pressure. Please note that Langer Transport has a procedure in place where we inspect our drivers discharge hoses on a quarterly basis. We will continue to do this procedure throughout our fleet. In this instance the drivers hoses were last inspected on August 2nd and no issues with the hoses were notated.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2500,420 ROUTE 440,US,

MGR., TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",1 EDEN LN,FLANDERS,NJ,07836-8950,Carrier,"On the morning of 9/9/19, Veolia employees discovered that a tote of caustic solution containing sodium hydroxide was leaking. Upon investigation , the employees were unable determine the  source of the small drips leaking from the tote so they decided to transfer the contents of the  leaking tote into another tote.  After transferring the contents of the leaking tote, the Veolia  employees investigated further to determine the source of the leak. Visible dents and scrapes of  the metal casing on the bottom of the tote caused from being loaded with the forklift were  identified.  It appears that the dented/damaged metal may have cracked the bottom outlet of the  tote at the middle of the bottom of the tote (though it could not be observed even when empty  without completely dismantling the tote). Veolia employees cleaned up the less than 2 gallons of  caustic solution that had leaked in the back of the original transport vehicle as well as the small  amount of solution at the Veolia Schenectady, NY 10 day in-transit facility.  The material that was  transferred into the new tote was sent to Stablex in Canada for appropriate disposal without any  further issues. All spill clean up materials were collected and sent for appropriate waste disposal.",Veolia's best guess as to what happened was that the tote was damaged by the original offeror of  the shipment.  Veolia notified the customer that better care should be used when handling totes and try to avoid damaging the totes when using a forklift.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The 11 white boxes each contained 12 aerosol-type cans(168g) and each brown box contained 6 aerosol-type(255g) cans. As the shipment was offered as an overpack I expected that the inner cans would be in another properly marked& labeled box. When I flipped the outer box over I saw cans between where the bottom flaps failed to meet in the middle of the box.

SHORTLY THEREAFTER, THE RESPONSE CONTRACTOR COMPLETELY STOPPED THE DIESEL RELEASE BY FURTHER TIGHTENING THE MANWAY SECUREMENT BOLTS.

TOM MACKIE FROM DOE AND THE LAND OWNER, MR. RICHARD CAMP TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT AND THE WAY FORWARD.  AS DECIDED IN THE MEETING, UYM STARTED COVERING THE ENTIRE RAIL BED AFFECTED BY THE SPILL WITH A PLASTIC TARO TO PREVENT INFILTRATION OF RAIN AND/OR SNOW MELT WATER. ONLY UNCOVERING WHERN RAIL CAR ACTIVITY IS NECESSARY.  UYM HAS SUBMITTED TO ECOLOGY FOR APPROVAL A DRAFT INTERIM ACTION WORK PLAN THAT WILL OUTLINE HOW TO DETERMINE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE RELEASE AND WHAT REMEDIAL ALTERNATIVES ARE PROPOSED FOR THE RELEASE SITE. THIS DRAFT INTERIM ACTION WORK PLAN WAS SUBMITTED TO ECOLOGY FOR REVIEW ON OCTOBER 14, 2019 TO MR. TOM MACKIE. DUE TO THE QUANTITY OF ACID SPILLED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THE ACID TO MOBILIZE HEAVY METALS KNOWN TO EXIST IN FACILITY SOILS, UYM WILL WORK WITH ECOLOGY TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERIM ACTION WORK PLAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.   ON TUESDAY 15 OCTOBER 2019, A CONTARCTOR HIRED ON BEHALF OF UYM TOOK 7 SOIL BORINGS FOR SAMPLES IN THE AREA AROUND THE SPILL SITE TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE ACID SPILL. THE SAMPLES WILL BE SENT TO A N OUTSIDE LAB FOR ANALYSIS OF PH AND HEAVY METALS TO DETERMINE THE DEPTH AND POTENTIAL OF MIGRATION DUE TO THE SPILL. MR. MACKIE FROM DOE WAS PRESENT DURING THE ACTIVITY.","1. ONE OF THE TWO METAL CAM ARMS OF THE CPVC COUPLING BROKE, EVIDENTLY DUE TO FATIGUE ALLOWING THE FLANGED CONNECTION TO SEPARATE CAUSING A MAJOR LEAK IN ACID. A. ACTION: ALL FITTINGS HAVE BE CHANGED TO STAINLESS STEEL “CAMLOK” FITTINGS AND WILL ROUTINELY REPLACED AS PER A SPECIFIED SCHEDULE.  2. THERE WAS NOT A VALVE ON THE LIQUID PIPE (“CHRISTMAS TREE”) WHICH MOUNTS ON THE TANK CAR AHEAD OF THE COUPLING, TO ALLOW SHUTTING OFF THE FLOW IF LIQUID. A. ACTION: A NEW 2” STAINLESS STEEL VALVE HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE “CHRISTMAS TREE” JUST ABOVE THE FLANGE THAT ATTACHES TO THE TANK CAR.  3. THERE WAS NO WAY TO DEPRESSURIZE THE CAR REMOTELY, SO THE ACID LEAK CONTINUED UNTIL THE PRESSURE INSIDE THE TANK CAR RETURNED TO ATOMOSPHERE PRESSURE. A. ACTION: THE ENTIRE COMPRESSED AIR CONTROL MANIFOLD HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH NEW CONTROLS AND A REMOTE EMERGENCY SHUTOFF VALVE AND PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE HAS BEEN ADDED AT GROUND LEVEL WHICH IS ACCESSIBLE AND EASILY ACTIVATED AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE UNLOAD ARE.  4. OTHER IMPROVEMENTS A. THE STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE (SOP) HAS BEEN REVIEWED, UPDATED, AND USED TO TRAIN ALL OPERATORS WHO ARE AUTHORIZED TO UNLOAD TANK CARS. B.

As a result, approximately thirty(30) gallons of printer ink were released to the unit's floor and undercarriage, as well as the asphalt and gravel surface underneath. LSHI retained Cura Emergency Services, LC(CES) to manage the cleanup. CES dispatched Lewis Environmental Group(LEG) to initiate corrective actions. Following a site assessment, LEG personnel observed approximately thirty(30) gallons of printer ink released to the unit's bed and undercarriage, as well as the asphalt and gravel surfaces beneath. LEG utilized simple green, isopropyl alcohol, calcium, Iime and rust remover, wire brushes, and absorbent pads to remediate the impacted unit floor and undercarriage. All impacted brushes and absorbents were collected and containerized into one(1) 55-gallon drum for transport and disposal. Site staff utilized granular absorbents to remediate the impacted asphalt and gravel surfaces. Site staff took ownership of all spent absorbents.
