I STOPPED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER HEARING THE SQUEALING NOISE.  I TRIED, MOMENTARILY, TO BACK UP, BUT I CAN'T HELP THINKING...THAT AT THAT MOMENT OR DURING THOSE MONEMTS THE TRAILER HAD TO HAVE ALSO SLID TO THE LEFT, CAUSING THE TANK TO RUPTURE.  WITH THE STEEL ""I"" BEAM FIRMLY IN PLACE AND GASOLINE FLOWING FROM THE POINT OF RUPTURE, I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE, EXITED THE CAB, RAN TO THE SIMONSOM STORE, AND DIRECTED A PERSON WORKING IN THE STORE TO CALL 911, AND AKSED FOR FIRE FIGHTERS TO RESPOND TO A GASOLINE SPILL AT THAT LOCATION.

ONXYS B/L #25-62279-00 JONES B/L #08755.  WHEN UNLOADING AT EMPIRE CHEESE YOU HAVE TO BACK INTO A INSIDE BAY WHERE THE MILK TRUCKS UNLOAD, SO BOTH THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER ARE INSIDE, AND THE HOOK UPS FOR UNLOADING ARE ON THE WALL BEHIND THE TRAILER.  ALL THE EQUIPMENT THEY USE TO UNLOAD MILK TRUCKS IS BEHIND THE TRAILER.  THE TANK THAT THE CAUSTIC GOES INTO IS ABOUT 30 FEET TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER, AND TO GET TO IT YOU HAVE TO WALK THROUGH A SMALL BREAKROOM AT THE BACK OF THE BREAKROOM IS A DOOR TO THE TANK ROOM, JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR IS THE CAUSTIC TANK.  THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY IN AND OUT OF THIS AREA, AND THATS THRU THE BREAKROOM AND THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE BREAKROOM IS THE DOOR THATS ABOUT 12 FEET BEHIND THE REAR OF TRAILER.  WHILE UNLOADING YOU HAVE TO WALK BACK EVERY SO OFTEN AND CHECK THE LEVEL OF THE TANK, BECAUSE THE TANK ONLY HOLDS ABOUT 3600 GALLONS, AND YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERFLOW THE TANK.  I HAD UNLOADED ABOUT HALF OF THE LOAD, I HAD GONE BACK TO CHECK THE LEVEL OF THE TANK ON MY WAY BACK OUT TO THE TRAILER THE HOSE SPLIT OPEN ABOUT 3 INCHES BEHIND THE TRAILER HOOK UP.  THE SPLIT WAS ACROSS THE TOP OF HOSE, AND CAUSTIC WAS SPRAYING OUT IN A STREAM ONTO THE BREAKROOM DOOR.  I HAD NO WAY OUT OF THIS ROOM TO SHUT THE TRAILER VALVE WITHOUT GOING THRU THIS SPRAY.  A PLANT WORKER WAS OUT BY THE TRAILER BUT HE COULD DO NOTHING BECAUSE HE DID'NT HAVE ANY PROTECTIVE GEAR ON.  I HAD ALL MY GEAR ON, BUT DID'NT WANT TO TRY TO RUN THRU THE SPRAY OF CAUSTIC.  I KNEW I HAD TO BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY ONE IN PROTECTIVE GEAR, AND I HAD TO GET THE SPILL STOPPED, SO I MADE SURE ALL MY GEAR WAS CLOSED UP AS TIGHT AS POSSIBLE, AND OPENED THE DOOR AND STARTED TO RUN THRU THE SPRAY.  ABOUT HALF WAY TO THE TRAILER I SLIPPED IN THE CAUSTIC ON THE FLOOR AND FELL DOWN.  WHEN I FELL MY HARDHAT AND FACE SHEILD CAME OFF.  CAUSTIC RAN ALL OVER THE LEFT SIDE OF MY HEAD. WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  I GOT BACK UP AS QUICK AS I COULD GET TO THE TANK AND CLOSED THE INTERNAL VALVE STOPPING THE FLOW.  THE TIME IT TOOK TO SHUT DOWN THE TRAILER AFTER THE HOSE SPLIT WAS ABOUT 30 TO 45 SECONDS, AND ABOUT 20 TO 25 GALLONS HAD SPILLED.  AFTER CLOSING THE VALVE THERE WAS A WATER HOSE ON THE FLOOR BY THE REAR OF THE TRAILER I TOOK IT AND STARTED SPRAYING MY FACE AND HEAD DOWN TRYING TO WASH OFF THE CAUSTIC.  IT WAS A FEW SECONDS AND THE PLANT WORKER CAME OVER AND STARTED SPRAYING ME DOWN WITH THE WATER HOSE.  I TOOK OFF MY RAIN COAT-RUBBER GLOVES-SAFETY GLASSED-GOGGLES AND LET THEM WASH ME DOWN AFTER A WHILE THIS THEY STOPPED AND SENT ME TO CUBA HOSPITAL TO BE CHECKED OUT.
