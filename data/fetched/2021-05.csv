These drums were transported to the Waco Safety-Kleen Systems, INC. 10 day facility without incident. Upon a container inspection by a CHESi National Trans Van driver, the drums were found to have an unacceptable amount of corrosion around the bottom chime and various other places on the body of the drums. The driver conducting the container inspection rubbed a corroded area of the drum at the chime and caused some material to flake off and  created a small pin hole leak on two different drums. Between the two drums approximately 2 oz. of aviation fuel was released on the concrete floor of the warehouse.","This release was a result of insufficient container inspection being conducted by the service representatives that accepted the drums. After an investigative call with the management team and the involved employees, it was determined that the entire branch staff would under go a series of remedial trainings to include container inspection. Since the occurrence of this release, the management team has delivered the remedial training and submitted a signed training roster with all participants listed.

The driver was a few minutes into the process, and reported that the pump appeared to be functioning correctly, and operating at a standard pressure around 70-75 PSI.  The driver walked away from the unloading location to deliver paperwork up to the office.  He was away from the scene for a few minutes according to his statement. This is against our company policy of driver remaining in attendance when offloading bulk product.  When he returned, it was discovered that  the bulk product was pouring out onto the gravel lot, and pooling beneath the tanker.  The driver immediately cut off the PTO, closed the valve to the bin, and contacted his dispatcher.  In total it is estimated that roughly 6,000 lbs. of product was released.  All of it was contained to the gravel lot, remaining pooled in a large puddle about 20 feet in diameter.  A local environmental response was called, and responded within a couple hours.  The product was vacuumed up to the extent practicable, and the remaining impacted soil and gravel was shoveled up  and containerized.  Some of the product will be eligible for commercial use.  The unusable product and residual waste water that was generated from cleaning the vacuum is being profiled and will be disposed of in accordance with EPA regulations.  An inspection of the scene revealed a blown 100 PSI burst disk.  A pressure spike had caused the disk to burst, and as a result, product was shot out of the outlet valve and onto the ground.  Upon returning to a company shop, the tanker was inspected. A ""headlamp"" flashlight was found at the bottom of the tanker, obstructing the internal valve.  It is thought that the pressure spike was likely caused by the obstruction.","1. Training issues:  Drivers will be retrained to follow the policy of staying in attendance when bulk product is being transferred off of a tanker into a bin.  Drivers and load crews will be retrained securing any loose items when working over a hatch, and in reporting to management any time a foreign object is accidentally dropped into a tank. 2. Possible quality issues are being addressed with our supplier of burst disks 3. Company engineers are designing a system that would allow a length of hose to be attached to discharge outlet and go back up into tank.  This would be in place during transfer of product, and would prevent bulk material from being discharged onto the ground when burst disk fails.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,31000,AUSTIN POWDER COMPANY,US,

ERTS contacted the driver for more information. He said the product is a UN1760 Sanitizer and he lost all 250 gallons on the outbound side of the toll plaza. Hazchem is on-site reviewing conditions. Hazchem advised that the entire tote released, escaped the trailer, and ran along the curb for about 100' before entering the storm drain. Hazchem has a vacuum truck in route to work on recovery from the drain. Hazchem will use a pallet jack and forklift to remove the freight from the trailer. HazChem personnel advised that they applied oil dri to the impacted area of roadway and collected it. Hazchem personnel applied oil dri to the rear of the trailer. Hazchem personnel utilized their vacuum truck to flush out collect the liquid in the storm drain. Approximately 100 gallons of product impacted liquids were collected and will be taken off site for disposal. Central Transport personnel will conduct the clean up of the freight trailer.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED,Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,8000,EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRAININGSOLUTIONS,US,

At inspection there was one drip approximately every 10 seconds.  PTRA contacted M&M Protection to respond and address the leaking tank car along with another car in the cut with a loose bottom outlet cap.  This is the report from M&M... Friday 05/07/2021 M&M Emergency and Environmental Services (M&M) responded to the PTRA North Yard at the request of Mr. Kirk Higbie, Port Terminal Railroad Association. Mr. Higbie indicated that railcar TCLX 318015 was leaking from the bottom outlet valve while railcar GBRX 705436 was reported to have a non-conforming bottom outlet valve housing. Both railcars were in a string of cars located on track #59. Mr. Higbie requested the railcars be repaired and readied for shipment. John McHazlett, M&M’s Director of Operations arrived on site and contacted the on-duty Trainmaster Mr. David Richardson. Mr. Richardson agreed to let M&M personnel lock out the switches on track #59 associated with the leaking railcars. After the tracks were locked out M&M personnel began the assessment on the GBRX 705436. After concluding the repairs to GBRX705436, M&M personnel mistakenly moved to railcar TCLX318031 and began an assessment of the bottom outlet adapter. TCLX318031 was not the correct car which M&M had been called to repair. The actual car to be repaired was TCLX318015 which was on the same track #59 but located about some car lengths south of TCLX318031. While addressing the bottom outlet adapter M&M personnel observed a slightly wet area around the outlet valve threads. The adapter was only hand tight and not fastened securely to the car. M&M personnel removed the bottom outlet housing, inspected the elastomeric gasket for a correct fitting. The gasket appeared to be in good order with no cracks, or seat etching. The bottom outlet adapter was reinstalled onto TCLX318031 and securely fastened to the bottom outlet valve. After completing repairs to GBRX705436, and the misidentified second leaking car TCLX318031 M&M personnel contacted the Train Master and relayed that all repairs had been made and locks removed. S","It was not until assembling this final report on 05/17/2021 that M&M realized the discrepancy between repairing TCLX318031 and TCLX318015. Upon the discovery Mr. Kirk Higbie with PTRA and Mr. Roy Gonzales with the FRA were both notified by M&M senior management that railcar TCLX318031 had been worked on versus the original call out for TCLX318015. M&M Emergency Response & Environmental Services regrets the oversight and accepts full responsibility for the crew misidentification of the car to be repaired. At no time did PTRA or M&M choose or decide not to make the needed repairs to TCLX318015. At the time M&M personnel had onsite the needed equipment and manpower to make all repairs and or product transfers to assure for a safe and compliant railcar.

They notified the Rook Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis, Hazardous Materials and Environmental Officer for the WLE.  Specialized Professional Services out of Washington, PA was then called to go out and assess the car.  They found fresh product on the sides of the car that looked like it was coming from the manway from around the area of the manway lid lid handle.  They removed seal SLY100192 from the manway lid and opened it up to check the gasket.  It was reported that the manway bolts were indeed tight.  The gasket did not look compromised to the point that it would leak but it was evident that product was coming out from the lid.  A new nozzle type gasket was installed replacing the ring style gasket in the lid. A new seal  #5973321 was installed on the manway.  They removed seal SLY100191 from the Protective housing cover so that they could open it and make sure that product wasn't coming from any of the valve.  They did not find any evidence of a leak.  The installed a new seal #5973312 on the protective housing lid. The product was then wiped off the sides of the car and the car was released into transportation.",Not sure exactly what happened here so I have no suggestions.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

The environmental contractor (EES) arrived on site and located the tanker. There is a bucket under the tank catching the leak. 1 gallon is in the bucket. There is a spill of 1 gallon of Naphthalene on the roadside soil in a 2' x 2' area. EES found that the primary shutoff valve under the tank is not fully closing. EES has the leaking flange sealed at this time and the gasket tightened up. M.C. Tank supplied a replacement CTMV and EES personnel conducted a product transfer.

This ~18 inch crack allowed approximately 5-10 gallons of free liquid to spill from the container. The Veolia employee handling the drum set the container down and leaned it against a pallet to reduce the magnitude of the leak. Another employee poured oil dry absorbent material onto the spill, which was contained to a 10x10 ft area within the warehouse. The drum was lifted up and placed into a 951H2 overpack drum filled 1/3 of the way with oil dry in order to absorb up any remaining free liquid that may leak from the original container. After allowing oil dry time to soak up liquid spilled on the ground, the absorbent was scooped up and placed into the overpack drum, which was then sealed. A Veolia supervisor was onsite and witnessed the spill and immediately informed the Veolia EHS Manager and General Manager of the incident. A discussion occurred regarding the integrity of these shipping containers that are used by this generator and there is concern behind why there is free liquid in these drums when the profile is setup to contain 75-90 percent absorbent, thus being classified as a flammable solid material. These issues will be investigated more thoroughly in the following days.","In order to mitigate incidents such as this from occurring again and possibly leading to a more serious incident, the customer will be notified that these materials should be packaged into containers that are rated for liquids and the containers should be stored in a manner that does not negatively affect the integrity of the container. Routine handling, like moving a container from one pallet to another should not lead to a severe container failure such as the one that occurred in this incident. Also these waste streams should be reviewed with the customer to ensure that they are classified appropriately, thus mitigating issues such as free liquids being present in a flammable solid waste stream.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Removable head plastic drum,1H2,No,,,,,,,113,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Chattanooga, TN. It was advised that 1 gallon of product released to the asphalt due to a pressurized hose cap during unloading. ERTS dispatched Hepaco (environmental contractor) to clean the impacted areas. No drains, soils or waterways were reported as being impacted. Hepaco reports the spill covered 2 lanes at the fuel island (areas 30ft x 60ft ) as well as all the pipes and pumps. Hepaco's plan of action is to use oil dry to get the heaviest impacted parts then use muriatic acid mixture for the concrete. They will need to use diesel fuel and degreaser to clean off the pipes and pumps at the fuel island. Hepaco completed the initial clean up operations. Site personnel coordinated the additional power washing and clean up operations with alternate environmental personnel.

The crew removed the pallets from the trailer and down stacked the pallets to collect the damaged containers. UST personnel collected 18 damaged / 9 impacted 1-quart containers of paint (UN3469) and containerized as waste. The crew then collected six (6) damaged 5-gallon pales of paint (UN1263) and containerized as waste. UST personnel deployed granular absorbents to the trailer interior and worked in with hand tools. The crew then applied a paint thinner to the trailer floor and wiped down with absorbent wipes. UST personnel collected the paint impacted material (cardboard boxes, containers) then containerized as waste. The crew palletized the non-damaged 1-quart containers of paint (UN3469) and 5-gallon pales of paint (UN1263) for transport. All paint-impacted material and damaged containers were collected in one (1) 95-gallon over pack, two (2) 15-gallon over packs, and one (1) 35-gallon over pack.

The following morning on 05/06/2021, employees arrived at the facility and discovered that a drum had leaked out of the primary container and into the trailer and asphalt containment area. The drum contained Styrene (Flammable Liquid). Employees discovered that a 55 gallon drum had been damaged with the forklift from the previous day.  Upon inspection it was determined that there was a large crack in the steel drum caused by a fork impacting the steel drum. The leaking drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon salvage drum to contain the leak.     On 05/6/2021 the Veolia safety manager of Schenectady, NY and the facility manager investigated what occurred at the Schenectady, NY transportation terminal. It was discovered that employee simply misjudged the length of the fork and caused a dent and crack in the side of the Styrene drum. The Safety Manager and Facility Manager reviewed the paperwork and the amount of Styrene released. Fortunately, due to the viscosity of the Styrene, much of the Styrene remained in the primary container. It is estimated that about 12 gallons of Styrene was released. An evaluation was conducted to evaluate if a Reportable Quantity was released. The weight of the Styrene was 7.5 lbs. per gallon and 12 gallons was released. Total weight was 90 pounds therefore, the RQ was not met and immediate reporting to the NRC was not required.","As part of the investigation on 05/06/21, the Veolia safety manager told the manager of the Veolia, Schenectady, NY facility that the employee who was operating the forklift could no longer operate the forklift until a review of the incident was conducted and that he would receive retraining.    The Veolia safety manager met with the facility manager and the employee on 05/20/2021 to review spill reporting procedures, investigate why the incident happened, and to retrain the employee on the forklift. The employee is fairly new to operating a forklift (less than 3 months) and he misjudged the forks of the lift. It was also later in the day and he may have ben rushing to get the large drum shipment transferred prior to leaving for the day.    In the future, the employee will be more careful when moving drums at the facility.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

Veolia employees investigated the source of the leak and discovered that about 1 pint of Ethanol Solution leaked into the trailer below the drum and slightly wet the trailer floor. Upon inspection it was determined that there was a scuff in the steel drum where the pin holes were. The drum was scuffed about halfway down the drum. It is assumed that the holes and the scuff were caused by a fork truck loading other drums adjacent to the drum. The drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon salvage drum to contain the leak and the liquid on the trailer floor was cleaned up.","The Veolia safety manager met with the facility manager on 05/20/2021 to review the spill and investigate why the incident happened. It is assumed that an employee loaded other drums too close to the drum that was scuffed and had two pin holes put in it.

The employee noticed a blue liquid had leaked out of a three gallon plastic container and stained the label as well as slightly wet the floor of the truck below the container. The Veolia employee investigated the source of the leak and discovered that about 100 milliliters of a waste flammable liquid leaked into the box van. No liquid made it outside of the box van. Upon inspection it was determined that the cap of the container was not seated correctly on the 3 gallon drum and allowed the 100 milliliters of liquid to spill out. The cap was removed and replaced and secured with a hand tool to assure that it was closed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A new label was also placed on the container. The liquid on the trailer floor was cleaned up.",The Veolia safety manager was notified of the incident by the facility manager on 05/12/2021. The two managers reviewed the incident details and decided the follow up action would be to discuss the incident with employees and also to review the incident with all employees during a weekly training to bring awareness to ensuring that containers are closed in accordance with the manufacturer closure instructions.

MGR., TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",1 EDEN LN,FLANDERS,NJ,07836-8950,Facility,"During a daily site walk a Veolia manager noticed a small puddle under a trailer sitting in the dock area of the Veolia Stanley Ave site. The puddle was roughly 1 quart of paint related material. He immediately notified the on site material handler and they began cleaning up the spill under the trailer. After containing the spill trained Veolia employees began offloading the trailer to look for a potential cause. The employees identified a leaking CYD11G that was packed during a recent household hazardous waste event in Dayton. The CYD11G contained 1 gallon and 5 gallon paint cans. As we removed each inner container, one 5 gallon container of Thompson Deck Sealer that was leaking from the chime was identified. Veolia believes this material leaked into the inner liner where it pooled up at the bottom of the liner. While unpacking the CYD11G we also identified two Sawzall blades that were floating loosely in the bag.  Further investigation revealed several holes in the inner liner that we believe were caused by the saw blades. Our final determination was that the container of Thompson sealer was compromised and leaking in the bag and the saw blade compromised the bag during normal container handling operations. In our investigation we determined that a customer (HHW Visitor) must have brought us a box of paint cans that also contained the saw blades. The blades were likely on the bottom of a box concealed by various paint cans. Our employees took a quick look at the box and saw only paint-related material so they dumped the box into the CYD11G without realizing the blades were there.","Veolia will use this incident as a safety moment for our team. We host several HHW events throughout the year and never know what hazards could be present in containers that are dropped off by the general public. We will also cover this during our hazard safety review meetings that we host before all HHW events. Lastly, we will use this as the talking point for our June EHS News Letter that is distributed within our branch.",No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, Occidental Chemical, was notified via CHEMTREC Report #2021-0513-00113.  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to inspect and correct the issue.  HEPACO reported finding less than a gallon of dried residue on the outside of the tank car.  The material appeared to have been released from the tank car’s pressure relief valve (PRV).  At the time of discovery there was no active leak from the tank car.

I radioed to the unload manager to get the hazmat into a salvage drum immediately as the Sort Manager tended to the package handlers hand.  Once I got to the salvage drum that had the bucket in it almost all of it had spilled into the salvage drum. I feel this happened cause of the way it was placed in the drum. The drum was taken to the cage and secured for me to follow the damage hazmat process on. The package handler's hand was entered into SCMS as a first aid. They later returned to their regular duties. DescribePack: It is unclear how the damage happened but the package handler stated they didn't know it was leaking. It was Either mishandled by the unload by not following orientation arrows or the lid was not securely on the bucket which would cause leaking at any point if the package turned on its side. Package couldn't have been leaking for more than 30 seconds to 1 minute. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: It was quickly moved and put into a salvage drum.

Local Police Department and Fire Department responded to assess the site. Tow Company was contracted to recover the vehicle, and CCD/PNE Corp was dispatched to perform the cleanup. Upon arrival on site, water was detected within the roadside ditch, a vacuum truck was utilized to recover approximately 1,500 gallons of liquid from within the ditch, and CCS/PNE proceeded to recover 2 truck loads of dry material from the impacted ditch. The area was secured with poly sheeting, pending analytical sampling results to determine further course of action. Upon receipt of sampling results, the bulk/majority of the cleanup had been performed; no product currently remains on-site and the immediate threat has been abated.
