An emergency response contractor was contacted to secure the shipment when the vessel arrived in Honolulu.  The container was diapered offloaded from the vessel under controlled circumstances to avoid any further damage and placed in a secure area.  It was discovered that one drum containing 30 gallons of Potassium Hydroxide, Solution, 8, UN1814 was completely empty.  The contents of the container had leaked through a hole in the drum.  The hole was caused by the drum being creased at the point where it overhung from a wooden pallet.  There was also a small leak from a loose closure on one of the drums.  It was wiped and the closure tightened.  The shipment was secured and reloaded to the vessel.",Drums of cargo must be securely positioned on a pallet where there is no overhang.

CSX Management immediately implemented their emergency response action plan and isolated the area.  The shipper, US Government, was contacted and informed of the release.  CSX contacted emergency reponse contractor, Hepaco Environmental, to respond and secure the car.  Once on site, Hepaco representatives found the cause of the release was due to a torn and deteriorated bottom outlet cap gasket.  At 1630 hours, Hepaco replaced the bottom outlet cap gasket and tightened the closure cap with a wrench. The car was secured and released on to destination.

Train was stopped and crews vacated area. Shipper (Lyondell/Equistar) was contacted and dispatched emergency response personnel. Lyondell response team contacted local fire department (Joliet) and emergency response contractor (HMHTTC). Fire department departed scene shortly after their arrival based on discussion with Lyondell personnel and site assessment. Per Lyondell personnel, the outer tank lining failed, which caused product temperature and pressure rise such that relief valve engaged. Subject tank car was flared as a means to control/burn venting. EJ&E personnel located and retrieved empty tank car.

DUring a routine inspection of the van trailer that was parked at a contained concrete loading pad, facility personnel identified liquid material had escaped from a 55 gallon container.  Facility personnel secured the area, retrieved the shippinag papaers and conducted an in-house emergency reposne to collect released material and secure the leaking container.  The container in question was identified and placed into a suitable salvage drum  all clean-up debris generated as a result of the clean-up was placed in this container and sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility,  The floor of the trailer and the concrete dock impacted by the release was decontaminated and placed back in service.","An investigation of this incident found that the container in question was filled with a liquid/solid mixture when, in fact it was described as a solid.  The container in question, when inspected, was found to have evidence of exterior corrosion rust at the bottom chime.  It is believed that during conditions normally incident to transportation that the chime failed allowing the liquid to escape from the container.  In order to prevent a recurrence, we have reviewed with the driver of this vehicle the propoer pre-loading inspection requirement for each container accepted for transportation.  This involves the inspection of container condition, marking, labeling and closure devices. In addition, the driver has been re-isntructed to isnure the material being accetped for transportation matches the material approved for transportation.  Discussions with the shipper indicated that liquid material consistent with the solid material expected was inadvertantly palced in the container.  Steps have been taken to insure that lqquid wastes be placed in appropriate containers on a go forward basis.

The vehicle in question was parked in a transportation related area.  DUring a routine inspection, it was discovered that approximately 25 gallons of material had escaped from a 55 gallon plastic drum onto the floor of the trailer and the concrete parking area where the trailer was staged.  Facility personnel reviewed the shipping paper and determined an appropriate response plan based on the material involved.  Using propoer health and safety controls and equipment, a crew entered the trailer and identified the leaking container.  A suitable absorbant material was deployed to absorb all freee liquid and this along with the damamged container was placed in a suitable salvage drum that was subsequently sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility.  The van trailer and surrounidng parking are was decontaminated and placed back into service.  It is believed that the material in the container was either experienced an exothermic reaction or the material pressurized in the container causing the side wall of the container to fail.","As indicated in the previous section, it is suspected that the material in question experienced either an exothermic reaction or the material volatized causing a pressure build up that resulted in the drum to fail.

(Clean Harbors) experienced a load securement failure which resulted in a release of hazardous waste material from an Intermediate Bulk Container (IBC).  At the time of the release the driver was transporting 44 flexible IBC containers of Incinerator Ash picked up earlier in the morning from Stericycle Inc., incinerator in North Salt Lake City.  The material was being shipped as RQ, Hazardous Waste Solid, N.O.S. (contains lead and cadmium), 9, NA3077, PGIII.   A fiber strap holding the last row of the IBC’s failed and two bags each containing approximately 960 pounds of the incinerator ash  fell  off the flatbed trailer onto the off-ramp of I-215 at the intersection of I-80 West.  One container spilt open upon striking the asphalt roadway releasing it contents while the second container remained intact.  The driver immediately pulled his vehicle oover to the side of the road, deployed the appropriate safety warning devices retireved his shipping papers and notified local  emergency authorities.  In addition, the driver notified his home dispatcher.  Upon notification, an emergency crew was dispatched to the scene.  The shipper of the material was also notified and they sent representatives to the scene to assist in the clean-up.  Upon arrival, local emergency authorities closed the off-ramp to allow the clean-up operation to commence in a safe manner.  All released material was recontainerized and placed in a bulk roll-off container along with all clean-up debris.   At conclusion of the clean-up operation which lasted approximatley four (4) hours, the trailer was released from the scene and continued to its intended destination without incident.  The material involved in the releases was properly containerized and is being sent to a suitable waste management facility.","The investigation conducted in response to this release found that one of the straps used to secure the contianers to the trailer was found to have a ¾ of an inch cut which allowed the strap to fail resulting in the cargo falling off the trailer.  The defect caused the strap to become loose and the cargo to eventually fall off.  At the time of loading, the driver did not identify an issue with the load securement device.  In order to prevent a recurrence of this event, the driver will receive refresher training on proper pre and post trip inspection protocol, en-route load check requirements and proper blocking and bracing techniques.  In addition, all load securement devices on this vehicle will be inspected and any defective or questionable devices will be removed from service and replaced.  The vehicle itself will be fitted with removeable sidewalls desinged to provide a second means of containment and securement to complement the strapping system used to secure this type of shipment in the future.",Yes,IBC,"Plastic, coated with liner, for solids",13H4,Yes,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,3025,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

The chief dispatcher called myself, John Vergis(the Assistant Environmental Officer)and I came out to look at the problem.  Before I left I called the OEPA and the local fire dept.  I also called SunPro, and Environmental contractor that we use. The car in the mean time was safely moved to another location away from people.  When we came out and inspected the car we found that the lid used to fill the car had loose bolts causing the gasket to fail.  We removed the old gasket and installed a new one and tightened down the lid and installed a new seal.  We then moved the car to our fuel pad and washed the car down so it would not be a hazard to others.  The water was collected and treated at our waste water treatment plant.  The car was then released for service.",Employees need to be better trained on the proper securement and inspection of cars before they leave the facility.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4571,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

The rail movement was immediately stopped. The BNSF Assistant Director Hazardous Materials responded and found the manway securement bolts tool tight. The manway seal (LUBRIZOL 501011) was removed and the securement bolts loosened to check the condition of the manway nozzle gasket. The 20 inch gasket was found to be approximately 90% missing and a new Viton manway gasket was applied. The manway cover was resecured and a BNSF HAZMAT seal numbered 1053 was applied to the manway. Spillage on the tank car shell was cleaned by an application of a bleach solution. No ground impact was evident. No further product release was noted during a subsequent rail movement.

One tank had product that spilled over the side of the tank and onto the cardboard that was underneath the tank. The cardboard appeared to catch all of the product that spilled. Olympus from Billings was contracted by Nalco to come and clean up the tanks. They found that one of the tanks leaked from the inlet cap and that the cap was nol screwed on completely by the shipper. The second tote leaked through the vents and they said possibly because it had been overfilled. After both totes were cleaned up, Nalco released the shipments to be delivered to the consignee.","Both of the hazardous spills would be a result of shipper error, The first tote did not have the inlet cap screwed completely on and my suggestion would be for the shipper to check the totes again before shipping to avoid this type of spilll.

BAX Global, Inc. will coordinate disposal of the waste generated.  No injuries or exposures were reported.  The Material Safety Data Sheet was requested.","Since the release was accidental and appears to be due to human error, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

At customer it was discovered that the tote (IBC) body had an 8"" crack approximately 3 feet up from the bottom of the tote which had allowed some product to leak from the IBC until the level of the liquid was below  the crack. With the tote no longer leaking, a forklift operator at customer took the  tote off the trailer and unloaded it in their normal process.    We believe the crack in the tote body occurred when the driver drove arcross 2 sets of rought railroad tracks upon entering the delivery location facility. the tote body was secured against a support bracket in nose of the the trailer which may have caused the crack to occur when the tote was shaken while crossing over the rough railroad tracks.","we discussed taking the trailer to shop and having the support bracket modified as well as moving the tote (IBC) off the nose of the trailer through the use of added blocking, bracing and dunnage.",Yes,IBC,"Plastic, freestanding, for liquids",31H2,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,HARCROS CHEMICALS INC,US,

The SJVR crew stopped movement and local F.D. responders closed the top operated bottom outlet valve (TOBOV) approximately 1/2 turn. This slowed the release at the top of the threaded bottom outlet cap (BOC) to a slow drip prior to 0930 hrs. PDT, 4/25/07. A receptacle was placed under the BOC to catch the product drips and GATX 21230 was isolated in the railyard. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder relieved the internal pressure within GATX 21230 and carefully removed the BOC. The responder found that the BOC gasket was missing. Consignee representatives furnished a replacement BOC gasket and it was applied within the BOC. After the BOC was tool tightened, no further drippage was noted from the BOC, ending all product release by 1300 hrs. PDT, 4/25/07.

A trench was dug in the ground below GATX 80561 to contain the spillage that was starting to pool and a receptacle was placed under GATX 80561 to catch additional product runoff from the side shell. A BNSF contract responder assisting removed the seal from the protective valve housing cover (Seal numbered CGL Blair 0185467) and inspected the valves.

Driver made inspection and determined a small amount of liquid was present on top and down the side of one tote (275 gallons). The contents were a cleaning compound containing sodium hydroxide. The driver called his dispatcher at Marten Transport, who then called Environmental Management, Inc. (E.M.I.), who has a contract to provide nationwide Emergency Response. E.M.I. contacted a local subcontractor, Seneca Environmental Services (Seneca), who responded to the site. The spilled material was cleaned up and the cap was tightened down. There was also a bung in the center of the cap which was also loose. Seneca determined both the bung and the cap had not been properly tightened. This allowed the material to splash against the cap during transit. The tote was inspected and no other problems were observed. Seneca determined all the material had remained inside the trailer, which was cleaned with absorbent material.  The incident took approximately five (5) hours from the call to the dispatcher until the response was completed. It was determined it was “human error” in not tightening the bung and cap on top of the tote.

Vehicle 2 (a tractor-trailer) struck our vehicle (a tractor-trailer) in the in the rear. This caused our vehicle to leave roadway and overturn off the highway. After striking our vehicle in the rear, Vehicle 2 loss control and overturned in the highway causing the road closure. The overturn caused damage to some of the batteries thus the leak took place. These batteries were “spent” and were being transported to be recycled. Many of the batteries contained very little fluid. The batteries were being transported under the packaging exception CFR49 173.159(e). The trailer was not placarded.    A witness of the accident helped our driver from the truck. The NC Highway Patrol was next to arrive, followed by the Linwood NC Fire Department. Neither our driver nor the other vehicle’s driver were seriously injured and required no immediate medical attention. Upon notification we contacted Crawford Wrecker Service to handle the accident cleanup, and A&D Environmental Services was contacted to handle the chemical spill. Next the NC State Emergency Management and the Rowan County Emergency Management were contacted. Later Davidson County Emergency Management was contacted. (The information we first received was that the accident took place in Rowan County NC, later we discovered the accident happened about a ½ mile from the county line and was actually in Davidson County NC.) The next contact was to the National Response Center. The road closure was due the other vehicle blocking the road, not because of the spill.     Our truck came to rest near a creek. Our environmental contracted placed absorbent booms in 3 locations to prevent and capture any of the trucks fuel from contaminating the water. Soda ash was applied to the soil to neutralize the acid from any of the leaking batteries. A vacuum truck was used to remove any contaminated soil from the battery spill and truck fuel spill. Our environmental contractor arrived within a few hours after the accident and took measures to contain any spill. However due the other vehicle blocking the highway and the upside down position of our truck it took some 12 or 14 hours from the time of the accident to completely remove all the batteries from the site. The batteries were reloaded into 2 poly-lined roll-off containers and transported to A & D Environmental’s facility for repackaging.",The spill was a direct result of our truck rolling over after leaving the roadway due to an accident.

The driver failed to slow to an appropriate speed before entering a long, sharp, right hand curve, and could not negotiate the turn. The unit proceeded across the oncoming lane and rolled over, coming to rest on the left shoulder of the road.   The trailer was loaded with liquid asphalt. A hole ripped in the left front of the trailer on impact allowed product to leak out of the trailer and onto the ground surrounding the trailer and adjacent areas. All product was retained in an area of approximately 6,000 ft2.  An environmental remediation crew was immediately summoned to the scene and was able to dam up areas of product flow to retain the produce in a relatively small area. Due to the thickness and properties of the product, the spill cooled and set up on top of the ground and was not absorbed into the soil. Cleanup was completed the next day by removing the product from atop the ground and restoring the original grade of the affected property.","APC maintains an excellent safety program, including new driver orientation and regular safety meetings which train drivers in depth on safe driving techniques, including speed and rollover prevention. This program will be maintained with a continued focus on all safety areas. In addition, drivers have been stopped from using the route in which this accident took place because of the dangers of the long and unusual curve on this road.

The oil spilled on top of the tank and eventually spilled out on to the road.  The driver immediatly stopped after recognizing the spilled oil and called our company and local authorities.  Our company sent three representatives for inspection and spill clean up.  Also we contacted our emergency spill response to help clean up the site.  Upon inspection we found no defects on the tank trailer.  The driver did not secure the tank lid correctly.  The estimated loss was approximately 35 gallons.  Our company along with the spill company worked with the police and fire department to clean up all the fuel oil on the road with oil abosorbent.  It is to be noted that the tank was decertified I had to put in a date so I just put the manufacture date but the tank has been decertified!  Please note this!,"All of our drivers received a safety bulletin to remind them about securing lids and manholes when top loading a tank trailer.  IN  addition, remedial training will be performed on inspecting lids and manholes before loading and securing them properly after loading.  Loading a tank trailer from the top of the trailer is rarely done anymore.  The trend in the refineries seems to be eliminating top loading of the tanks because of the liabilities involved.  So as refineries continue to get rid of top loading tanks the human error in loading and securing the package is diminished.  The safe functions tied into bottom loading a tank trailer reduces the human error aspect of the package not being secured properly in the tank.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3872,"James A.

The contractor responders were then hired by CMA-CGM America to investigate and mitigate the leak source. The shipper contract responders opened CLHU 371742 and reported finding one composite IBC (UN Package Specification 31HA1/Y/9-06/USA/+AA3710/5050/1998/1050L/60kg/100kPa/3-07/3-07) dripping product at the bottom discharge valve at the IBC base. It appeared that the leak source was at the juncture of the valve insertion into the plastic IBC. The remaining product in the leaking IBC was transferred into a suitable IBC.

CSXT Hazardous Material Sentinel, Paul Watson, responded and determined that product was leaking from around the liquid valve mounting pipe nipple.  He relieved the pressure on the car and the product release stopped.  CSXT responded an emergency response contractor, REACT Environmental Services, who inspected the valve and found the pipe dope was dried out and the valve was not completely seated on the liquid line pipe nipple. REACT removed the valve, cleaned the threads and re-installed the valve. The car was staged for 24 hours and no release of product was found. The car was secured for transportation to the consignee.  The Shipper, Golden Grain Energy was notified via CHEMTREC, report number - 2007042000095.  The incident was discussed with representative of Renewable Products.

During routine switching operation, the switch crew smelled an odor coming from car. The car was isolated and a CSXT emergency response contractor, SPSI, was dispatched to the scene. The switch crew was taken to the hospital for observation. They were released with no restrictions and returned to work. SPSI found signs of a leak in the area of the manway cover at the hinge. The manway cover was found to be slightly out of position causing the ring gasket on its lid not to completely seal against the tank car manway nozzle. SPSI re-seated the manway in its proper position and pressure tested all tank car valves and fittings to 20 psi with nitrogen. The corrective actions taken were successful in stopping the leak and securing the tank car for shipment. Car was then released to final destination.

During the normal course of transportation, the driver made a routine stop at Clean Harbors 10-day intransit storage facility located at 3201 Evergreeen Avenue, West Sacramento, CA.  After secring the vehicle and conducting a ppost trip inspection, the driver was released from duty.  Subsequent to the driver leaving the office for the day, facility personnel identified a minor release of product from the exhaust pipe of the cargo tank's scrubber unit.  The individual placed a contaimnet pail under the exhaust pipe and deployed a suitable absorbent material over the area where the release occurred.  It is estimated that 6 gallons of material escaped and was either contained within the containment pail or was absorbed with the absorbent material.  Once identified, facility personnel contacted local police and fire as well as the California Toxic Substance Control Department.  Authorization was obtained to conduct a truck to truck transfer for the leaking container to an alternate cargo tank.  This operation was done without incident. Once transferred, the shipment was sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility.  IN addition, all clean-up debris was containerized and disposed of in accordnace with all applicable Federal and State requirements.  An inspection of the cargo tank that failed identified a travel valve that would not close completely.  This ank was placed out of service pending repairs and follow-up inspections.","At the time of loading, the driver inspected his vehicle and did not identify any deficiencies or defects.  IN order to prevent a recurrence, drivers will continue to conduct both pre and post trip inspections as well as on-road loaded cehcks.

While on site, the truck was loaded with 52 lead acid batteries on wood pallets.  Each battery contained 6.4 gallons electrolyte (sulfuric acid).  The batteries were strapped together using duct tape and nylon tie downs.  The batteries were not directly strapped to the pallets.  The pallets were not secured to the vehicle.  Neither placards not a shipping paper were provided to the driver, who accepted the load and proceeded to Consumer's Jackson Service Center, 1955 West Parnall, Jackson, Michigan.    During transport, the driver experienced an incident which forced a sudden brake application near the Capitol Avenue on-ramp to Interstate 94 near Battle Creek.  At this time, there was a load shift.  Some batteries tipped at this time.  The driver visually checked his load, did not stop, and continued to the Jackson Service Center.    Upon arrival at the Jackson Service Center, leaking sulfuric acid was observed.  Of the 52 batteries shipped, 4 were empty, and 18 showed evidence of minor leaking.  Staining was observed on the stake truck's wood floor.  The leaks were caused by inverted batteries draining fluid out the top vent hole.  Consumers Energy personnel contained the leak, and contacted an environmental contractor to neutralize the release and clean the batteries.  The stake truck bed and other affected areas were decontaminated by Consumers Energy personnel using power washing / rinse.    This report contains a release volume in solid pounds.  The release was, in actuality, 25 liquid gallons of sulfuric acid.  The ""solid pound"" entry was required due to the Incident Report Systems' inability to allow battery, wet, filled with acid releases in liquid terms.  We used the shorthand of 10 lbs per gallon of sulfuric acid for the calculation.","The incident is being addressed on three levels.  First, the issue was addressed with the driver involved in the incident.  Second, the work unit handling battery shipments received several initiatives.  Finally, company wide processes are being reviewed to prevent recurrence.    Several initiatives have been directed toward the driver.  A formal reprimand has been initiated for his role in accepting the hazardous materials shipment.  The driver will be responsible for conducting a safety meeting for other employees, regarding hazardous materials and proper load securement.  The driver also participated in the work unit initiatives listed below.    The work unit involved in battery transport conducted a meeting to review the incident, and discussed several items.  A Company hazardous materials shipping paper, detailing hazardous materials encountered by this work group, was reviewed to assist in identification of regulated materials.  A general review of the hazardous materials regulations and proper load securement was conducted.  The USDOT Guide for Preparing Shipping Papers was reviewed, to further help identify undeclared shipments.  Finally, the battery packaging requirements at 49 CFR 173.59 were specifically reviewed.      Further initiatives are planned for the work group.  An annual review of applicable hazardous materials regulations is planned.  Additionally, Consumers Energy has contacted the Michigan Center for Truck Safety for presentation of a session on Hazardous Materials Training and Load Securement, to provide an independent voice in our program.    Finally, the incident has been reviewed on a corporate level.  Mr. G. Nick Reichert, Fleet Acquisition, Regulatory, and Technical Manager, has reviewed the incident.  Consumers Energy intends to use the knowledge from this incident to strengthen programs across all work areas.  Mr. Reichert also serves as an additional contact for this report, as follows:    Mr. G.

Apparently, the hose from the rail car came out of the tank that was being filled, during the trans-loading process.  Kemira Logistics, Inc. personnel plugged a nearby storm drain that was impacted by the free product, and constructed a dirt berm in an attempt to contain the free liquid.  Sooner Emergency Services, Inc. of Tulsa, Oklahoma was dispatched to perform the remainder of the cleanup.  Sooner Emergency Services, Inc used a vacuum truck to recover as much free liquid as possible and excavated the contaminated soil as needed.  Sooner Emergency Services, Inc. will coordinate disposal of the waste generated as a result of the incident.  No injuries or exposures were reported.","Since the release was accidental any may have been related to a loose hose, no actions have been taken to prevent recurrence.

The side of the pail was dented in and the paint spilled out from the gap in the lid. The paint on the pail and shrink wrap was dry when it arrived. The shipment did have dunnage around it however the leak would be obvious to the laod and since there is no exception at UDV, the spill would be the fault of the loader who mishandled the haz mat freight at UDV. Approximately two ounces was released and the dent in the can was approximately 4 inches long. There was no additional cleanup of the freight except to put the leaking pail in a salvage drum in Billings since the paint that had spilled out was already dry.","To prevent recurrence, I would suggest more training for the loader at UDV on how to properly handle haz mat freight and prevent damaging the product while handling it.

After approximately five minutes of unloading the anhydrous ammonia, the hose ruptured and a release of product occurred. Immediately after the release, emergency responders were called. The release prevented the driver from activating the emergency shut-off controls, so the driver and a facility employee immediately ran to warn others and began evacuating the neighbors. The emergency responders arrived on scene and the state police continued the evacuation and dosed roads. After the release ended, the authorities permitted facility employees and neighbors to return to the facility and their homes.","River Rock Logistics has hired Hard Hat Services, Inc., an environmental remediation  contractor, which is conducting site reconnaissance and developing a work plan for review by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency.

The SuperSack was filled with lead concentrate and was loaded into a  gondola with several other Super Sacks. During transportation, a pipe retaining the sacks in an upright position was dislodged and the sack fell over, apparently being torn open by a broken weld from the pipe, allowing some of the contents to release into the bottom of the gondola.  Mr. Sekavec made contact with Horsehead (Shipper) and they dispatched Bellon Environmental (Contractor) to secure the sack, remediate the inside of the gondola and retarp the car. Bellon personnel placed the material in the gondola into two salvage drums to continue in transportation. No other temediation was needed as there was no release of the contents outside the gondola.",Ensure proper loading and securement methods are used by the shipper.

During a biannual inventory of radioactive sources at  Columbia Generating Station (Columbia) it was discovered that two EntryScan®  Explosive Detectors, each containing a 10 mCi Nickel-63 source, were transferred to PPL  Susquehanna, LLC without marking the shipment as UN291 1 as required by 49 CFR  173.421(a). The explosive detectors were shipped from Richland, WA on April 13, 2007  via Landstar and received in Berwick, PA on April 17, 2007. Energy Northwest has  confirmed that the devices are currently under the control of an entity licensed to possess  such material.  Energy Northwest purchased the explosive detectors from the manufacturer Ion Track  Instruments in 2002. The detectors arrived at Energy Northwest on September 28, 2002  as Radioactive Material, Excepted Package, Instruments or Articles, 7, UN291 0 which  was the appropriate designation at that time. The received crates were not physically  marked as UN2910 as this was not required by Federal Regulations in 2002. The  detectors were not removed from their original crates and placed in the station  warehouse until they were sold to PPL Susquehanna, LLC in 2007. The explosive  detectors were maintained by Radiation Protection on the station source inventory list;  however, warehouse personnel processing the shipment were unaware that the detectors  contained radioactive material. The explosive detectors were shipped in their original  crates which were not physically denoted as containing hazardous material. Based on  Federal Regulations at the time of the shipment, the explosive detectors should have  been shipped as Radioactive Material, Excepted Package, Instruments or Articles, 7,  UN291 I with the crates labeled UN291 1.  The explosive detectors are maintained under a general license subject to the requirements of 10 CFR 31 and Department of Transportation regulations in 49 CFR. Following identification of the undeclared shipment, Energy Northwest initiated an apparent cause evaluation of the circumstances surrounding the shipment. This incident directly resulted from a lack of clear identification alerting warehouse personnel that the crates contained hazardous material prior to shipment. This condition is attributed to a less-than-adequate understanding of the regulations governing these explosive detectors by all responsible stewards. Had more robust corporate processes governing the control of generally licensed devices been implemented through training, procedures, and oversight, this incident would likely not have occurred.  There were no consequences associated with this event. The sources were checked for leaks upon arrival at PPL Susquehanna, LLC and confirmed less than detectable levels of radioactivity. Furthermore, Nickel-63 is a low activity isotope and during radioactive decay emits a beta-particle that is easily shielded. With these sources contained","Energy Northwest has evaluated the cause of this event and is taking the necessary steps within our corrective action program to prevent recurrence. This incident has  attributed to less-than-adequate processes governing the control of generally licensed devices. As such, Energy Northwest will enhance formal processes governing these devices. These processes will be implemented through enhanced training, procedures, and oversight to ensure consistent compliance with applicable regulations. Furthermore, Energy Northwest will appoint an individual for each licensed device to ensure day-to-day compliance with appropriate regulations and requirements as stipulated in 10 CFR 31.5(c)(12). Each generally licensed device associated with Columbia will be clearly identified to inform station personnel of the device’s controlled status and appointed custodian.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,ENERGY NORTHWEST,US,
