Unfortunately, the Ticket Agent checking in the Passengers did not notice the Shipper's Declarations attached to the handles of the bags or the Class 9 Hazard labels nor did any of the Ramp personnel in ORF as they were loading the bags onto the aircraft.  Upon arrival of the American Eagle Flight 4102 operated by Envoy Airlines into Chicago O'Hare (ORD) Airport, the Class 9 labels were noted by Envoy Ramp personnel upon unloading and the bags were stopped from further transportation.  The Naval Aviators did not tell the Agents about the contents of their bags nor did they indicate the pouch attached to the handle of the bag.",American Airlines has taken steps to provide additional guidance to personnel in ORF.  Bulletins were posted by the Station General Manager.  These bulletins were forwarded to the Station General Manager in SEA as well as shared with Customer Care to alert other locations in the American Airlines system.  The FAA was again notified as we had recently had this problem with other Navy bags departing from Seattle (SEA) Airport.

Then I went and found the package in the cage, I missed it from before because my labeling was off. Not an excuse. It was my fault and I take full responsibility for it. It was just a difficult week as I took on a large portion of work, which isnt a problem besides the fact I am part-time. It will not happen again. My course of action for future prevention I have already been working on as I have been trying to step up more so and process damaged HazMats.

THE TRUCK AND DOUBLE TRAILERS BEGAN TO SLIDE ON THE SLUSH TOWARD THE OUTSIDE OF THE CURVE. BILL WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE COMBINATION ON THE SHOULDER FOR SEVERAL SECONDS BEFORE THE PUP LEFT THE PAVEMENT AND STRUCK A CULVERT AT ABOUT 40 MPH. IT LOST A WHEEL, WENT AIRBORNE, CLIPPED A POWER POLE, SHEARED ANOTHER, AND OVERTURNED. THIS PULLED THE LEAD TRAILER AND TRACTOR OVER ONTO THEIR RIGHT SIDES. THE COMBINATION STRUCK A FENCE AND A VEHICLE IN THE PARKING LOT OF GLACIER ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE BESIDE THE ROAD, DOING DAMAGE TO BOTH. IT APPEARS THAT ONE OF THE FENCE POLES CAUSED A PUNCTURE IN THE SHELL OF THE PUP (APPROXIMATELY 3 INCH DIAMETER ON THE LEFT SIDE), BUT THE TRAILER LANDED WITH THAT SIDE UP, AND VERY LITTLE PRODUCT WAS LOST FROM THIS HOLE. THERE WERE SLOW LEAKS OF GASOLINE AND DIESEL FROM THE MANWAY HATCHES ON THE TOPS OF BOTH TRAILERS. EMPLOYEES OF GLAICER AND THE NEARBY CHS PIPELINE FACILITY REACTED VERY QUICKLY TO CONTAIN THE SPILL BY CATCHING FUEL IN BUCKETS AND TRANSFERRING IT TO A PORTABLE TANK, AS WELL AS DIKING THE DRAINAGE DITCH BESIDE THE ROAD AND USING SORBENTS TO MINIMIZE THE SPREAD OF THE FREE PRODUCT. THE TRAILERS WERE DRAINED OF PRODUCT , AND THE COMBINATION WAS SEPARATED, RIGHTED, AND TOWED. THE RECOVERED PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THE DITCH DIKE AND BOOMS WERE LEFT IN PLACE TO PREVENT CONTAMINATED MELTWATER FROM MOVING TOWARD THE INTERMITTENT STEAM BED 150 YARDS TO THE NORTH. THE TRAILERS ORIGINALLY CONTAINED 3,001 GALLONS OF 87E10 GASOLINE AND 9,000 GALLONS OF #2 DYED DIESEL FUEL. ALL OF THIS FUEL WAS RECOVERED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 24 GALLONS OF GASOLINE AND 214 GALLONS OF DIESEL. WEST CENTRAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANTS HEADED UP THE CLEANUP EFFORTS. WITH THE SPRING MELT, THE GROUND ON SITE IS NOW EXPOSED. WCEC PROJECT MANAGER NATHAN OLSEN WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE THE SOIL CONDITIONS THIS WEEK. HE IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING SOIL TESTING AND PLANNING FOR SMALL AMOUNT OF EXCAVATION TO REMEDIATE THE AFFECTED SOIL.","THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THIS RELEASE WAS EXCESSIVE SPEED FOR THE WORSENING ROAD CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE OVERTURN. THE DRIVER WAS SIMPLY DRIVING TOO FAST IN THE WINTRY MIX THAT WAS ON THE ROAD, AND THE DRIVER NEEDS TO SLOW DOWN IN SUCH CONDITIONS. THERE WAS A CONTRIBUTING CIRCUMSTANCE WITH THE TRAILERS. IN THE SLICK ROAD CONDITIONS, THE DRIVER COULD HAVE REDUCED THE CHANCES OF THE INCIDENT BY REDUCING THE LOAD AND RUNNING WITHOUT THE PUP TRAILER. WE HAVE EMPHASIZED TO THE DRIVERS THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY TO DROP THE PUP IN SUCH CONDITIONS. THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTING MECHANICAL FACTOR. DUE TO WORK BEING DONE ON THE LEAD TRAILER THAT BILL NORMALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING, HE WAS OPERATING A DIFFERENT TRAILER, WITHOUT A PERMANENTLY LUBRICATED FOR SUBSTITUTED TRAILER. THIS LIKELY RESULTED IN LESS STEERING CONTROL DUE TO THE ADDITIONAL FRICTION BETWEEN THE FIFTH WHEEL AND THE APRON.

The response crew, wearing the correct personal protective equipment, transferred this paint related material to a new IBC container. The damaged IBC and the waste generated from the cleanup were placed in the appropriate branch waste stream.     It was discovered that the damaged IBC had been improperly prepared for transport by the generator; the package was missing the rigid fiberboard floor, and thus the bottom outer bag was not supported and had sagged through the gaps in the pallet. These sagged areas were punctured by the forklift blades when the operator moved this IBC. In addition, it was discovered that the generator had not stacked and secured the inner paint cans in this IBC correctly, which led to the IBC having loose liquid paint inside.     This was reported to the CT DEEP, Spill #2018-0808.","When introduced into transportation, this package showed no evidence of a release.

The inspector noted an odor and heard audible hissing coming from the car.  It was observed that the manway ears appeared to have been bent downward by overtorquing the manway swingbolts.  This condition did not allow the hard gasket to fully seal the nozzle to lid surface resulting in a minor vapor release.  BNSF Hazmat responder arrived to inspect the car and replaced the manway gasket with a soft elastomeric nozzle gasket to allow for adequate sealing.  The car owner (Nutrien) then arranged for an OTMA to continue travel to the diverted destination for repairs.  There were no injuries or exposures associated with this response.  Estimated release volumes are entirely estimated as it is not possible to determine an actual release volume of vapor from the container.","Verdegaal indicated that they do not utilize the manway as part of their unloading process.

He opened the valves and nothing was flowing.  After a bit he realized he was hooked to the wrong compartment (needed to unload compartment 1 and was hooked to compartment 2 and two was now empty).  He was getting 'flustered' in the confusion and when he went to hook to the correct compartment and forgot the step where we always bleed any pressure and product off of the valves to ensure its safe before removing the cap over the external valve.  1 pint sprayed out impacting his chemical suit.  Some sprayed up under his face shield which was partially up and did not have his goggles as directed by the work assignment.  He admitted he knew this was wrong but he was hot and sweating and figured it was safe since product hadn't been flowing.  He went to the eyewash station and felt like he was ok afterwards.  The next day he woke up and had some irritation in his eyes.  He then went to an urgent care facility who had him transported over to a clinci in Winschester, Va.  They found a surface burn on the eye.  Since then he has fully recovered and has no further issues with his eyes.",The driver ultimately decided to resign and retire.

In the event of steaming the railcar some phenol (100 lbs) burped out of the top manway into our containment dike.  The team had to offload enough of the material so it could be shipped to our customer.  The railcar and containment area was cleaned and the loaders proceeded to offload the railcar back into a process tank.,Performed an investigation into the spill and made several recommendations to prevent any occurrence of an overflow out of the railcar.  The team will reduce our steam from 190 pounds pressure to 100 pounds.  The procedure will be updated with this change.  The procedure will also be updated to reflect either unloading the railcar the day an overload occurs or the very the next day.  This will reduce the amount of time the railcar would be on steam as the phenol should stay in a fairly good molten state within that time frame.  The other update to the procedure is to reinforce the monitoring of all railcars when they reach a certain percent in the railcar. The goal is zero overloads on any railcars.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,SABIC,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper was notified via Canutec Report 613-996-6666. HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched the scene and found a vapor release due to a misaligned gasket on the manway cover.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to Neil Fehr, with Co-Operative Refinery.  After inspecting the manway cover gasket for defects, HEPACO was able to re-secure the manway cover with the gasket properly installed.  This secured the vapor release and the car was release for transportation.

The fine powdered substance, which is a surfactant, spilled from the hole created in the side of the drum.  The size of the hole was approximately the size of a tennis ball to a baseball.  Airline Management was contacted and the Lead Environmental Coordinator contacted a local Environmental Response company to come to PHL airport for cleanup.  Miller's Environmental of Philadelphia responded at 21:17 and cleaned up the spilled substance using an industrial vacuum with a Hepa filter.  A Ramp employee who was Asthmatic inhaled some of the powder and was transported to the hospital for examination and treatment.  She had an adverse reaction to the medications and was admitted to the hospital for 4 days.","A bit more attention to detail/care could have been taken by the loader operator to ensure the shipment did not brush against the side of the cargo compartment opening.  The damage occurred to the side of the shipment opposite from the loader operator and was therefore difficult to see without stopping and walking to the other side of the loader to check for clearance.  This would not be normal procedure. The drums on the pallet may have been a bit ""oversize"" requiring extra attention and care to load.

New Comments:  Contents are two 1-lb. bottles of ?triple distilled chemically pure mercury? as manufactured by Jelinek Alloys Div. and I. Stern Products Corp. It appears the two small boxes were packaged in a USPS padded mailer, which was packed inside another USPS mailer, which was then packed into the small fiberboard box in which it moved through our network. The outer package has no markings of any kind other than the label.
