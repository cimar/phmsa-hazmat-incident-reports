IN THE NORMAL OPERATION OF HIS TRACTOR TRAILER HE HAD TO REACT QUICKLY TO AVOID A REAR END COLLISION WITH AN AUTOMOBILE AND A CEMENT MIXER TRUCK THAT ABRUPTLY PUT ON THEIR BRAKES. UPON BRAKING HARD, OUR DRIVER FELT THE LOAD SHIFT IN HIS TRUCK. HE PROCEEDED TO THE NEXT EXIT AND INSPECTED HIS LOAD. UPON INSPECTION HE FOUND THAT AT LEAST 10 OF THE 64 BARRELS WERE NOW ON THEIR SIDE. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, HE DISCOVERED THAT FLUID WAS LEAKING FROM ONE OF THE BARRELS. THE COMMODITY WAS SODIUM HYDROXIDE SOLUTION (UN#1824). IMMEDIATELY, THE PROPER AUTHORITIES WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SEEN. BRENT KISER, PUCO HAZARDOUS MATERIAL SPECIALIST INSPECTED OUR DRIVER, EQUIPMENT, AND THE SPILL DURING THE COURSE OF HIS INVESTIGATION. I DISPATCHED ENVIRONMENTAL ENTERPRISES, INC. (513-772-2818) TO THE SCENE TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL AND INSPECT THE SHIPMENT. THEY ARRIVED AT 1827 AND ABSORBED THE SPILL AND STOOD UP THE BARRELS THAT HAD TIPPED OVER. THEY COMPLETED THEIR WORK AT 1940 AND CONFIRMED THAT ONLY ONE BARREL HAD LEAKED. THE LEAKING BARREL HAD A LOOSE BUNG THAT TOOK ONE FULL TURN TO BE SECURED. IN ADDITION, TWO OTHER UPRIGHT BARRELS WERE FOUND TO HAVE LOOSE BUNGS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE LOAD WAS SECURED AS MUCH AS WAS POSSIBLE AND RELEASED BY BRENT KISER FOR DELIVERY.I INTERVIEWED OUR DRIVER AND SECURED HIS WRITTEN STATEMENT ON THE COURSE OF EVENTS. IN ADDITION, I TOOK PICTURES TO DOCUMENT THE SCENE AND CONDITION OF THE LOAD. IN MY VIEW, THE LOAD WAS NOT LOADED OR PACKED PROPERLY BY THE SHIPPER. THERE WERE TWO TYPES OF UN#1824. THIRTY-TWO BARRELS @ 680# EACH, AND THIRTY-TWO @ 700# EACH. THEY WERE PACKED FOUR TO A SKID WITH ONE NYLON-BANDING STRAP AROUND THEM AT THE TOP. THIS WAS NOT ENOUGH TO HOLD 2720# TO 2800# SAFETY INTACT IN NORMAL TRANSPORT. A DUNNAGE OR CARDBOARD CORNER WITH ADDITIONAL BANDING IS NEEDED. THE FREIGHT WAS SAFELY DELIVERED ON FRIDAY, 10/8/99. UPON OFFLOADING OUR DRIVER SAID HE DISCOVERED ADDITIONAL BARRELS WITH LOOSE BUNGS. IF THE BUNGS ON THE BARRELS WERE PROPERLY SECURED AND THE SKIDS PACKED TIGHTLY WITH DUNNAGE AND BANDING THIS INCIDENT WOULD NEVER HAD OCCURRED. I FIND NO LIABILITY ON RUSH TRANSPORTATION/LOGISTICS PART. THEREFORE, WE WILL INVOICE SOUTHSIDE SERVICES FOR ANY AND ALL EXPENSES WE INCURRED TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL AND OUR TRAILER.
