ACTION TAKEN AT TIME DISCOVERED: THE FOREMAN CALLED FOR ASSISTANCE.  AN ABSORBENT DIKE WAS PLACED AT THE REAR OF THE TRAILER AND ON THE GRAVEL DRIVE (WHERE MATERIAL WAS SPILLED). THE ROSS EMERGENCY COORDINATOR WAS CALLED TO THE FACILITY TO DIRECT RESPONSE ACTIONS. A PAPERWORK REVIEW TO DETERMINE THE CONTENTS OF THE TRAILER WAS CONDUCTED. PERSONNEL DONNED APPROPRIATE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND ENTERED THE TRAILER.  ADDITIONAL ABSORBENT WAS PLACED ON THE TRAILER FLOOR TO CONTAIN THE LEAK.  THE TRAILER WAS MOVED TO THE ROSS INCINERATION SERVICES, INC. UNLOADING DOCK WHICH INCLUDES A SECONDARY CONTAINMENT PAD. ALL DRUMS WERE CARTED OFF THE TRAILER AND INSPECTED.  ONE LEAKING DRUM WAS DISCOVERED.  THE DRUM WAS OVERPACKED INTO A SALVAGE DRUM.  THE TRAILER FLOOR WAS SWEPT WITH FLOOR DRY. THE ROSS TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, INC. TRANSFER STATION WAS REMEDIATED.  A BACKHOE WAS USED TO REMOVE CONTAMINATED SOIL.  A TOTAL OF EIGHT (8) 55 GALLON DRUMS OF SPILL CLEAN UP (CONTAMINATED SOIL, ABSORBENT AND PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT) WAS GENERATED.  REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE COMPLETED BY 6:30 P.M.  THE DRUMS WERE CHARACTERIZED AND THEN INCINERATED ON-SITE AT ROSS INCINERATION SERVICES, INC.

TRAINMASTER O.O.ROBUCK, THE FIRST OFFICER AT THE SCENE, MADE A VISIBLE INSPECTION AND MADE THE DETERMINATION TO CALL THR HAZ. MAT. TEAM.  WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE SCENE, THR ENTIRE NORTH YARD WAS EVACUATED TO THE SOUTH END OF THE PARK AND THE HAZ. MAT TEAM HAD SET UP COMMAND POST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD. AFTER CONSULTING WITH EVERYONE AT THE SCENE, MYSELF AND TWO FIREMEN MADE INSPECTION OF THE TANK CAR VALVES AND FOUND THE SAFETY RELIEF VALVE VENTING WHICH NO FIELD REPAIRS COULD BE MADE.  BY THIS TIME WE HAD PLACED A CALL TO GEORGIA GULF AND TWO REPRESENTATIVES ARRIVED AND CONCURRED WITH US THAT NO FIELD REPAIRS COULD BE MADE. AT THIS TIME WE HAD TWO ALTERNATIVES, TO TRANSFER THE ENTIRE PRODUCT INTO TANK TRUCKS PROVIDING THEY COULD FIND THE TANK TRUCKS AND THE TIME CONSUMPTION OF APPROX. 10 TO 15 HRS IN TRANSFERRING THE PRODUCT.  THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE WAS TO SPECIAL THE TANK CAR TO GEORGIA GULF. AFTER A BRIEF DISCUSSION WITH EVERYONE IN CONCERN IT WAS IN AGREEMENT THE BEST SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEM WAS TO SPECIAL THE TANK CAR TO GEORGIA GULF, SINCE THE TANK CAR HAD COOLED DOWN TREMENDOUSLY AND WAS VENTING SLOWLY. WITH THE PROPER AFFORDED PROTECTION THE TANK CAR COULD MOVED SAFELY TO ITS DESTINATION. WITH THE TEAM OF OFFICERS MADE OF TRAINMANSTER O.O.ROBUCK, C.

THE REMAINING VAPOR WAS THEN PULLED BACK TO THE RECOVERY SYSTEM.  WE ESTIMATE THAT WE RECOVERED APPROXIMATELY 116,310 POUNDS OF R-22, INDICATING A LOSS OF 42,240 POUNDS OF PRODUCT. WE FEEL THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS THAT COULD BE TAKEN TO KEEP THIS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE.  THE BEST WAY TO AVOID THE RECURRENCE OF THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE TO REMOVE THE BOTTOM OUTLET VALVE FROM ALL OUR TANK CARS.  IF THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, WE SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: 1. MAKE SURE THAT THE CAR SHOP TORQUES FLANGES PROPERLY 2. HAVE EACH CAR SHOP INSPECT AT LEAST ONE TANK CAR UNDER OUR SUPERVISION TO INSURE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS 3. WHEN LEAVING THE SHOP, TANK CARS SHOULD BE CLEANED AND PURGED WITH NITROGEN 4. THE BOTTOM OUTLET VALVE SHOULD BE REBUILT AFTER EACH TRIP 5.
