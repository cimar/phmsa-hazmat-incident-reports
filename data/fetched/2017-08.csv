He notified the WLE Dispatcher who then called myself, John Vergis Environmental Officer for WLE.  When I arrived, I found that oil was leaking from the bottom outlet valve cap.  Upon looking further I found that the 2 inch plug in the cap was loose.  I loosened the plug a little more to see if the leak would slow down or get worse to see if maybe the valve itself was defective.  The leak did slow down so I took the plug out and then inspected the valve for any leaking through on the valve seal.  The valve was not leaking.  The oil that was leaking out was trapped in the valve nozzle.  I cleaned the old thread sealant off the cap plug and put new sealant on the threads and then installed the plug and tightened it.

Rich reported that they have already placed the container in a clear area away from people and where letting the tank relieve pressure. At this time ERTS considers this as a non-emergency situation due to the product being an inert gas and there is no one in the area. ERTS estimates the nearest contractor to be 60+ miles out with a 2 hour ETA. by the time a contractor was to arrive the cylinder would be empty and the contractor would have a 4 hour minimum to respond.

The loader started loading product back into the railcar. After several minutes of unloading the trailer, product started releasing from the air valve fitting that was setup on the railcar. The loader then shut the air valve off. Product then started coming out from the flange of the rupture disk housing. Its estimated 30 gallons of product was released and impacted the ballast. The Massachusetts DEP was notified of the release. The DEP incident number is 2-20272. The local fire department visited the terminal in response to a call from the state. They departed the terminal with no further findings. Clean Harbors was contacted and arrived at the terminal at 5:50 PM. Clean Harbors filled two drums with ballast and used one bag of lime to neutralize the product   Upon further investigation it was learned that the loader and the driver were working together to complete this premium service transfer. The loader was on top of the railcar while the driver was sticking the trailer. The loader insists that the driver was not paying attention to the transfer and overloaded the trailer.

THIS CONTAINER WAS NOT SCHEDULED FOR BAY 13 AND WAS THEREFORE LOADED ERRONEOUSLY. AT 0846, SUBJECT CONTAINER TQMU1855400, ORIGINALLY PRESTOWED FOR 131582, WAS INCORRECTLY LOADED TO 131584. AFTER LOADING TWO ADDITIONAL CONTAINERS TO BAY 13 ON DECK FOR THE STOWAGE ERROR WAS APPARENTLY DISCOVERED. AT 0855 TQMU1855400 WAS TAKEN OFF OF THE VESSEL AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE DOCK IN ORDER TO REMOVE THE TWISTLOCKS FROM THE BOTTOM CORNER CASTINGS. WITHOUT EVER DISENGAGING FROM THE CONTAINER, THE CRANE OPERATOR RETURNED TQMU1855400 TO THE VESSEL. SINCE THE INTENDED STOW POSITION WAS STILL OCCUPIED BY THE INCORRECT CONTAINER, MR. CAMEZ ELECTED TO PLACE TQMU1855400 IN A TEMPORARY POSITION ON THE HATCH COVER SO THAT HE COULD REMOVE THE INCORRECTLY STOWED CONTAINER. UNFORTUNATELY, THE TEMPORARY POSITION THAT WAS CHOSE WAS ALREADY SET UP TO RECEIVE 40’ CONTAINERS WHICH MEANT THAT THE DECK CONES THAT WERE ALREADY IN PLACE WERE SITUATED APPROXIMATELY 18” AFT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CONTAINER. MR. CAMEZ LOWERED THE CONTAINER DIRECTLY ATOP THE OFFSHORE DECK CONE THAT WAS LOCATED IN 140482 WHICH IN TURN PUNCTURED THE BOTTOM OF TQMU1855400. THE LEAKAGE WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY NOTICEABLE TO ANYONE WHILE THE CONTAINER REMAINED IN THIS POSITION WITH THE CONE LODGED IN THE RUPTURE. AFTER DISCHARGING THE INCORRECTLY STOWED CONTAINER, MR. CAMEZ THEN RE-ENGAGED TQMU1855400 TO FINALLY LOAD IT INTO THE CORRECT POSITION. ONCE THE CONTAINER WAS CLEAR OF THE DECK CONE, THE LIQUID CARGO BEGAN TO FLOW FROM THE DAMAGED TANK. WHILE LEAKING, TQMU1855400 WAS ULTIMATELY RE-HANDLED TO THE ORIGINAL PLANNED STOW LOCATION OF 130582.

Shipment was billed as Hazardous Material with various HazMat commodities, in the interest of safety, the unit was placed on hold from outgating and was moved to the containment pit area pending interior inspection of the cargo. LA County Fire Dept.  Health HazMat Team responded to the spill. The leaking substance was tested by United Pumping Services, the unknown liquid tested positive for acidic hazardous materials. Interior inspection revealed mixfreight varying in sizes and weight, stowed throughout the whole container. Responders offloaded and transferred freight to discover eight 55 gallon drums on pallets labeled as ORTHOPERIODIC ACID (UN3093) Hazardous Corrosive, that had been crushed due to a second and third layer of palletized freight being stacked on top. The damage to the drums resulted in product spilling from the holes on the sides, losing approximately 100 gallons of product. Responders were able to recover approximately 10  15 gallons of product that spilled on the container floor and on the ground, the damaged drums were placed in over pack drums and properly labeled. Contaminated freight was remediated and loaded back into the original trailer, the remaining freight had to be split and loaded into good order empty unit JBHU 309013.

The facility personnel hooked up their hose to tank, and, using an industrial sized pump, began pumping the product out of the cargo tank into their storage.  While the product was being unloaded, our driver heard a loud ""cracking noise"", and looked over to see the cargo tank shell collapsing.  Immediately, acid began to pour from the tank onto the dirt ground at the facility.  It is unknown how long the acid spilled from the trailer, but, the trailer was estimated at half full at the time of failure and near empty after all product drained from tank.  It is believed that about 2500 gallons of Hydrochloric Acid spilled.  The local fire department was contacted, and once it appeared safe, facility personnel began to try to neutralize the acid using chemicals that they had on-hand.  Once product was neutralized and the site deemed ""safe"", the facility and shipper arranged for remediation from an environmental service of their choice.  The following day, the driver was allowed to unhook from the trailer and exit the facility in his tractor.  The cargo tank was left on-site for further investigation by safety personnel and insurance adjusters.","Upon investigation, it is our belief that the driver properly prepped the cargo tank for offload.  It is believed that either the vent valve on the trailer failed or that the 2 inch vent line could not ""keep up"" with the pump used to offload.  The investigation, thus far, is not complete.  Therefore, we're unable to determine the root cause of the accident.

The unloading operation was stopped immediately.  The material that spilled on the pavement was soaked up with sand/gravel, placed in a container and stored before it was properly disposed of. Some of the material also contacted the truck driver.  The driver was immediately taken to a safety shower and rinsed, then taken to a local medical facility for evaluation.  There was no treatment given and the driver was released with no restrictions.  During the course of the investigation, it was determined that the truck driver inadvertently pulled a hose off of his truck that was expired.  Further inspection of the hose indicated excessive wear at the ""bend"" area which most likely contributed to the failure.",The carrier company (L & B Transport) provided a warning to the driver related to proper pre-use inspection of unloading hoses.  L & B Transport is conducting a thorough review of all hoses to be sure they are within their expiration dates.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6100,ExxonMobil,US,

Upon arrival, the forward cargo compartment was opened and it was noticed that there had been a spill of a white liquid that had already dried.  After investigating, we determined that the passenger's bag contained 4 bottles of cleaner with bleach.  Of the 4 bottles of cleaner, one had opened and completely emptied its contents, totaling 32 fluid ounces.  The tile cleaner flowed from approximately 6 feet left of the forward cargo door to 2 feet to the right of the forward cargo door and it dried in place leaving a white residue on the cargo compartment floor.  As this was a spill of known origin we completed the offload and called aircraft maintenance to inspect the Cargo compartment to ensure the aircraft was safe to continue to travel. The captain placed an item in the logbook and aircraft maintenance took the aircraft out of service to be able to pull the floorboards and complete a thorough inspection. The on the bag in question was #5001955519, tagged for passenger Padmanabharao Uppalapatisrikrishna.  The passenger was travelling from Tampa to O'Hare and then connecting to British Airways with a final destination of Hyderabad, India.","In this case, the passenger checked his bag in Tampa.  He did not declare the dangerous goods in his bag, but he may have not known.  American Airlines does train their people in dangerous goods and our ticket counter folks ask the question if there are any hazardous materials inside the bags being checked.  This bag was screened by the TSA in Tampa and the TSA missed the 4 (32-oz) containers of cleaner with bleach.  Perhaps they were unaware that the cleaner was dangerous goods.  The recommendation would be to ensure that all personnel are properly trained on dangerous goods in baggage.  When in doubt the TSA should pull the item out of the bag.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),,,ZZ,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,American Airlines,US,

The truck was headed north on I-25 and the driver noticed smoke escaping the van trailer. The driver stopped the truck, called for emergency help and responded by separating the tractor from the trailer / await responders. Once responder crews arrived, the trailer was opened and a drum had failed due to chemical reaction or fire. The scene was expanded to include closure of I-25 northbound lanes due to the nature of the incident and the lading of the trailer. The southbound traffic was already previously diverted due to construction which created a safe buffer for the public.     The local Fire Department HAZMAT team made entry into the trailer, retrieved the container that was the source of the chemical reaction / fire, and repackaged the container into a salvage drum. The chemical residue that was released onto the trailer floor and asphalt was also repackaged to an appropriate container (salvage drum) for transport. The truck was released by the Fire / EMS crews for transport to safe haven at the ACT yard in Commerce City, Colorado.     The container failed at the bottom 1/3 of the drum, due to heat melting the plastic construction material, resulting in the release of the solid oxidizer material. The material in the package was Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) that is consolidated at a collection facility operated by ACT in Albuquerque, NM.     Interstate 25 was re-opened at approximately 9:00 p.m.","The Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) collection personnel that generate the packages for transport have been re-trained on the packaging procedure to include: 1. Identification of materials and potential incompatibilities, 2. Proper packaging of HHW materials to prevent chemical reaction during storage and shipment.  ACT has also reviewed the procedure to ensure that packaging of HHW oxidizers is appropriate and the procedure has been updated to include inventory and review of container contents prior to storage and shipping.",Yes,DRUM NON-METAL,Removable head plastic drum,1H2,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,7000,Advanced Chemical Transport,US,

He approached a curve where his passenger side steer tire left the pavement and sunk into the sandy soil. He responded by turning hard to the right and hitting his brakes. the inertia of the tanks pushed his truck along and he continued to pull the left. This resulted in his truck falling on it's drivers side and his trailers fell that way as well. The hard turn caused the rear trailer to collide with the lead trailer resulting in a breach of the front drivers side seam to to rupture. Most of the spill was from the rear trailer. The product flowed quickly on the road by the curb and into the backyard of a property. The front trailer was leaking from the top loading hatch onto the road as well. The spill did not encroach any drainage. The curb leak stopped approx 100 ft from the spill. As for the yard, the product pooled in a low-laying area. The driver got out with a small laceration on his head, bruising on his arm, and a sore back. He has been treated and is seeking treatment and I on light duty until he is released to work. Emergency personnel were on scene in 10 mins. The spill was cleaned up in 4 days. An environmental study/test was performed and the property was deemed as clean.","We performed a post-crash assessment with the driver/management/safety to determine what the cause was, and to consider strategies to prevent future crashes with Hazmat.
