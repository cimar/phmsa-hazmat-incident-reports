Train inspection revealed BN 974302 (ICC 111A100W1 tank car) had derailed upright with both trucks out from under this tank car. The A-end tank head embedded into the ballast, but the tank was not compromised. The derailment cause was attributed to BN 974302's center sill that failed at an existing partial fracture (40% old break) towards the A-end of this tank car. The closed bottom outlet unloading arrangement of T-piping was damaged by ground impact and residual product that remained inside the damaged piping escaped. BNSF contract responders treated the impacted soil/ballast with a microbial bioremediation agent targeting hydrocarbons.

After putting on his appropriate PPE, the driver safely climbed into the trailer and found that 15 gallon container of Hydrochloric Acid had formed a leak.  This was caused by a nail puncture from the pallet that the drum was sitting on during transit.  The drum was flipped over in order to apply ""hardening putty"" and it was then placed into an overpack drum.  The driver reported the incident to his supervisor in El Paso and to inform that he had secured the container from leaking further which he informed the guards the same.  The guards had already had already dispatched the ""White Sands Missile Range"" Fire Department who is stationed onsite.  It was reported to the firemen that the leaking drum was already contained which they confirmed.  The Emergency Responders (WSMR Fire Dept) were called by the guard since the incident occurred on government property.  The Emergency Responders were inpressed how the driver contained the leak and secured the area.  The neutralized area on the road was placed in a bag for Univar to dispose of the material.  The drum was weighed at the Univar facility and it was short approximately 1 pound (16 ounces).","To improve or prevent similiar future incidents, all pallets will be inspected for damaged before use.

NATX 72473 was cordoned off in the railyard awaiting a detailed inspection. BNSF contract responders inspected NATX 72473 and observed that the spillage had emanated from the vacuum relief valve (VRV). The product outage was checked and deemed appropriate. All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure. Responders removed the VRV and a stainless steel pipe plug was inserted in the vacated VRV orifice to seal it. It appeared that the VRV was stuck in the open position and it expelled product during movement via a hydraulic surge within the tank car. The spillage on the tank shell was cleaned with a mixture of Micro-Blaze and water. No ground impact was evident. Clean-up was completed by 1418 hrs. CST, 2/08/09.  Intact seals removed numbered 057614 and 1052766. Seals applied were SRS 000418 at the manway and SRS 000412 at the valve housing cover.

The shipper, CF Industries, and local agencies were notified and responded. CF Industries personnel inspected the tank cars in the yard to determine the source of the odor.  They identified PLMX 137630, a loaded tank car of Anhydrous Ammonia, as being the source of the odor.  CF Industries personnel reported the odor was possibly coming from the pressure relief device.  CF Industries using their equipment and personnel moved the tank car back to their facility (approximately one mile away) so that they could unload the car and then inspect the valve. CF Industries later advised that they were unable to confirm that there was an actual vapor release from the pressure relief device. They indicated that the residue tank car would be forwarded to a rail car repair facility to have the pressure relief device inspected and replaced if necessary.

When they looked over the situation, they said that the packing on the liquid unloading line needed tightened but the nut on the valve stem was stripped and it could not be tightened.  The shipper was contacted and they wanted a contractor of their choice to look at the car and see if it could be repaired.  Their contractor, ResCarr responded on the follwing Tuesday the 10th.  They said that the valve would need replaced.  They ordered a new valve and they came back out on the 12th to replace it. A movement approval was sought by the railroad to get the car to destination where it was unloaded. The approval was recieved on Feb 13th.  The car moved that day and was delivered to the consignee on Feb 15th. The consignee received a movement approval for its movement back to Sarnia, Ontario.  The car was tagged as not to load per movement approval instructions.

In so doing when he overfilled the tank product came up through the uncapped drop tube resulting in a seven gallon spill onto the pavement and in the spill containment bucket.  The driver immediately closed the internal valved for the trailer compartment, to stop the flow of product.  He then utilzed the spill kit on the tanker and the spill response supplies at the store to contain and clean up the seven gallon spill.","After a debriefing of the incident, the driver realizes that he made two errors, one he did not accurately read the before stick reading and two he did not put the cap on the second drop tube.

Once grounded, FSTZ 884585 was directed to the containment area for follow-up inspection. BNSF contract responders cleaned the spillage atop the rail flatcar with absorbent material followed by an application of a microbial bioremediation agent. The responders then inspected FSTZ 884585. One steel 55 gallon drum was found toward the trailer's nose that had leaked from a cut in this drum's sidewall. The responder's assessment was that the cut appeared to be from a forklift tine and most likely damaged during drum loading into the trailer. The cut in the drum was sealed with putty and then placed into an overpack/recovery drum for future appropriate disposal. The spillage atop the trailer floor was absorbed and cleaned. Afterwards, all drums removed were repositioned inside FSTZ 884585 properly blocked and braced for continued transportation.

Driver took the turn at 15 miles per hour. The truck was top heavy, resulting in the vehicle tipping over onto its side; causing the hydraulic lock lid to bend, releasing approximately 4,000-5,000lbs of Ammonium Nitrate, and less than 1 gallon of fuel/hydraulic oil onto the sidewalk of Lamb Blvd.  The fuel/hydraulic oil was kept separate from the Ammonium Nitrate by the vehicle operator.  Driver immediately called supervisor, the sheriff's department and the fire department who, in turn, called Chemtrec: our hazardous materials emergency response team.  Chemtrec then made a series of phone calls to emergency response units and Sanders Construction, Inc. management.  Fire department unnecessarily evacuated the area within 1,000' of the spill.  Sanders Construction, Inc. supervisory and cleanup detail were on site within 45 minutes of the spill at which time the spill site was immediately declared non-life threatening.  Cleanup procedure commenced immediately after the vehicle was placed upright.  No leakage of Ammonium Nitrate or fuel was able to enter into the public water system including drains and gutters. 100% of Ammonium Nitrate was reclaimed.  Cleanup lasted approximately 4 - 5 hours, after which traffic resumed.",Driver was severely reprimanded.

The driver was alerted by the store attendant that product was running out on the ground.  The driver shut down operation and helped spread absorbent and spill pads.  The driver dribbled the remaining product into the tank, shut down and helped clean up the area.  An environmental company was called into further clean up the area and remove product from the storm drain.  When they arrived they flushed and vacuumed the storm drain, cleaned the apron around the drop site and disposed of the materials.  Approximately 100 gallons overflowed from the spill containment bucket.  It was discovered that the plunger in the bottom of the spill containment bucket had been removed and plugged.  The plug blew out due to a vent restriction in the underground storage tank.","We are going to discuss, train and improve our unloading procedures by helping drivers identify possible problems with underground storage tanks (spill containment equipment and safety features, vent piping at service stations.)",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,22200,,,

There was no release of hazardous material. The initial cause of attention was an odor of styrene in thetrailer, however, it was determined that this was due to the container cap which is designed to vent pressure. Since this material was known to be a Class 3 flammable liquid, it was then noted that there were no ""flammable"" lables on the 4 containers, and no palcards on the truck. Examination of the shipping papers showed that the materials had been described as ""TOTE(S) NOT REGULATED UNDER CFR 49"". The 4 totes were unloaded and ""flammable""labels affixed ot them. The shipper was notified immediately that the undeclared shipment had been received at Fort Payne, and that an incident report would be filed with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of USDOT. The shipper, after conducting an internal investigation, reported that as a result of a clerical error in entering material into their accounting system, the wrong material code was assigned to the shipment, and labels printed for the shipment were actually for another material that was not hazardous. They also reported that the error had been corrected, and that they expected no similar occurences in the future.","We believe it was recent hazardous materials training that resulted in heightened awareness on the part of personnel unloading the truck, and triggered the reporting of the incident.

U/A the bags were noticed leaking small amounts from multiple skids and packages. Further investigation revealed the weight of the bags on each skid had caused the boards on the skids to bowe and the nails in the skid to pop causing small holes in the bags against the skid surface. There was not a barrier (paper or cardboard) betweeen the skid surface and the bagged product. The carrier notified the shipper who originally had the material described as Disodium salt, anhydrous, 8, UN3253, PGII. Research of the product revealed this to be an incorrect descrpition as the UN3253 is not available in PGII nor was the shipping name represented on the bill of lading associated with the UNID provided by the shipper. Numerous attempts to obtain the correct description as stated on the manufacturers MSDS went unanswered. After nearly 8 weeks of notification to the shipper of the defficiency and requests for disposition for the released product the shipper sent the updated shipping name and UN to reflect the MSDS supplied by the shipper on April 16, 2009. The correct UNID and shipping name are used in this report. The shipment was ultimately authorized by the shipper to be repackaged and returned. U/a arrival to the carriers terminal for the return process the bags which had not leaked during the first phase of transportation released product again for the same reason stated above. The shipper ultimately authorized the delivery of the recouped product which was not returned to the shipper and held at the carriers facility to be overpacked and moved to the consignee. The release was managed in 2 hours. The time frame to manage the shipment was nearly 8 weeks due to lack of cooperation from the shipper tendering the product to the carrier. No exposures or injuries resulted from this incident.",Use of hard wood skids and a protective barrier would have certainly prevented this occurrence. The lack of cooperation from the shipper and the obvious lack of training played a definite roll in the lenght of time it took to mediate the release and get the necessary corrections required for the paperwork.,No,BAG PAPER,Paper bag (cont1 for solid materials),BAG PPR,No,,,,,,,245,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Estes Express Lines,US,

Conrail brought the car in question to our facility on the afternoon of February 3. There had been a heavy snow in the area and the tracks were partially covered in snow. Our maintenance personnel went to move the car into our tank car barn per normal procedure using our Trackmaster. As the car moved past the last switch before going into the barn, the back wheels of the tank car went off the track, also derailing the Trackmaster. Several attempts were made to get the tank car and the Trackmaster back on the track. At the end of the day our maintenance staff was able to get the Trackmaster out but the tank car as still derailed. Calls were made to Conrail for assistance and they told our staff that they would come in the morning to move the car back on the track.  Conrail personnel arrived the next morning with equipment and were able to get the tank car back on the track. We moved the car into the barn where it was found that the back wheels suffered damage. The tank, however, was not damaged and we were able to feed product into our facility with no problem. We contacted the vendor and informed them of the incident. The vendor was able to get in contact with the owner of the tank car, GATX, who is advising them on who to get to fix the car.  At this time, the car is offloading product and should be empty by March 27. In our investigation of the incident, we found that ice got into the switch. The ice did not allow the switch to function as designed and this caused the derailment. In the future, we will make sure that the tracks are cleared and that the switches are properly de-iced so that they can function properly.",NO COMMENT PROVIDED,No,TANK CAR,Pressure,105JW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,DWWTP,US,
