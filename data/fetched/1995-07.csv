AFTER STACKING THE BOXES ON TWO PALLETS HE TOOK SOME SHRINK WRAP AND WRAPPED EACH UNTIL SECURE.  HE RAN A STRAP ACROSS THEM AND DEPARTED.  WHEN THE DRIVER CROSSED THE TRACKS HE SAW SOME BOXES FALL AND IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER STOPPED.  A MAN IN A HALLIBURTON TRUCK PULLED OVER ON THE LEFT SHOULDER OF THE STREET AND STARTED TO ASSIST THE DRIVER IN PICKING UP THE BOXES.  ANOTHER MAN IN A HALLIBURTON STATION WAGON PULLED IN FRONT OF OUR TRUCK AND ALSO ASSISTED.  WHILE COLLECTING RESTACKING THE BOXES HE NOTICED ONE OF THE MEN WALKING BACK FROM THE CAR.  OUR DRIVER BELIEVED HE HAD COLLECTED ALL OF THE BOXES AND LOOSE CHARGES, THANKED THEM FOR THE HELP, AND RETURNED TO THE ACME TERMINAL IN LAFAYETTE.  HE TARPED AND SECURED THE LOAD AND PROCEEDED HARVEY.  UPON ARRIVAL, OUR DRIVER COUNTED THE SHIPMENT SEVERAL TIMES AND CAME UP WITH 50 BOXES AND THREE BAGS (INNER PACKAGING) OF CHARGES.  HE DISCOVERED AT THIS TIME THAT ONE OF THE PLASTIC BAGS WAS TORN WITH ONE CHARGE MISSING.  AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH WAS THEN MADE OF THE AREA WHERE THE BOXES FELL.  ONE CHARGE WAS FOUND AND RETURNED.  AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO RECOUNT THE BOXES AT THE DESTINATION, BUT SOME WERE ALREADY GONE AND USED.  THERE ARE THREE POSSIBLE SCENARIOS WHICH COULD EXPLAIN THE ABOVE.  FIRST, A MISCOUNT MAY HAVE OCCURRED AT THE INCEPTION OF THE HAUL, I.E., 53 BOXES COULD HAVE BEEN PICKED UP INSTEAD OF 54.  SECONDLY, THE BOXES COULD HAVE BEEN MISCOUNTED AT THE DESTINATION. FINALLY, ONE BOX POSSIBLY BE MISSING, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT PRESENT AT THE SCENE WHEN THE SCENE WAS RECHECKED FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT. BECAUSE THE SHIPMENT WAS PARTIALLY USED AFTER IT WAS DELIVERED, THERE IS NO WAY AT THIS TIME TO VERIFY EXACTLY WHICH SCENARIO IS CORRECT.  ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETELY PREVENT AN INCIDENT SUCH AS THIS ONE, ACME WILL INTRODUCE STEPS TO ATTEMPT TO LESSEN THE RISK OF A FUTURE SIMILAR OCCURRENCE.

INSPECTION DEVELOPED SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT ON DECK OF FLATCAR, DAMPNESS ALONG WITH COAGULATED PRODUCT UNDERNEATH TRAILER. TRAILER WAS GROUNDED/ISOLATED AND DUE TO PUNGENT ODOR AND POTENTIAL REACTION WITH MOISTURE. IMMEDIATE ACTION WAS TAKEN TO SECURE MSDS BY CONTACTING YELLOW FREIGHT, PORTLAND, OR., FOR SHIPPER/CONSIGNEE INFORMATION. CONSIGNEE JAMES RIVER CORP, CAMAS, WA., SUPPLIED MSDS AND VOLUNTERED EMERGENCY RESPONSE ASSISTANCE ACCOUNT KNOWLEDGE OF PRODUCT AND RECENT TRAINING ON SPECIFIC PRODUCT. YELLOW FREIGHT CORPORATION, KANSAS CITY, MO., REQUESTED OLYMPUS ENVIRONMENTAL, PORTLAND, OR., TO RESPOND. THE SINGLE VERTICAL OPENING DOOR WAS PROTECTED WITH INTACT SEAL YFS9590168. SOME DIFFICULTY WAS EXPERIENCED OPENING DOOR ACCOUNT CARDBOARD CARTONS AGAINST DOOR. UPON OPENING NOTICED CARDBOARD CARTONS STACKED TO WITHIN 3 FEET OF ROOF COMPLETELY ACROSS OPENING. SUFFICIENT CARTONS, ALL SHOWING EVIDENCE OF PRODUCT CONTAMINATION AND DETERIORATION, WERE REMOVED TO LOCATE THE 20 DRUMS MOVING SINGLE LAYER IN NOSE OF TRAILER. JAMES RIVER FORCES ENETERED TRAILER AND FOUND THREE DRUMS WITH LOOSE 2 INCH SCREW BUNGS AND SPILLED PRODUCT ON TOP. THE BUNGS WERE SECURED AND SODIUM BICARBONATE WAS SPREAD ON TOP AND AROUND DRUMS TO NEUTRALIZE/STABILIZE SHIPMENT. CARTON REMOVAL CONTINUED UNTIL DARKNESS WHEN TRAILER WAS SECURED PENDING FURTHER CLEANUP. ON JULY 11, 1995, OLYMPUS ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINUED CLEANUP. THE 20 DRUMS WERE FOUND IN UPRIGHT CONDITION WITH NO EVIDENCE OF ROUGH HANDLING. THERE WAS NO BLOCKING OR BRACING INSTALLED IN TRAILER. ONE WOODEN PALLET WAS FOUND IN A VOID IN NOSE OF TRAILER AND A 4X8 SHEET OF PLYWOOD SEPARATED DRUMS FROM FAK SHIPMENT. WHEN THE DRUMS WERE REMOVED, ALL WERE NOTED WITH PRODUCT STAINING AROUND BOTTOM CHIME. SOME DRUMS DISPLAYED RUBBING ACTION IN AREA OF ROLLING HOOPS. ONE DRUM WAS FOUND TO BE LEAKING APPROXIMATELY 1 PINT PER HOUR FROM THE BOTTOM CHIME AREA. ALL DRUMS WERE OVERPACKED ACCOUNT POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER LEAKAGE. THE INSIDE NOSE AND ROOF AREA OF TRAILER WAS CONTAMINATED WITH PRODUCT. THIS RESULTED FROM INTERNAL PRESSURE BUILD-UP DURING TRANSPORTATION DUE TO AGITATION, TEMPERATURE CHANGE, AND ELEVATION CHANGES. THE LOOSE BUNGS ALLOWED THE MATERIAL TO ESCAPE AND SPRAY THROUGHOUT INTERIOR OF TRAILER. THE FAK PORTION OF SHIPMENT WILL BE DISPOSED OF AS HAZARDOUS WASTE. DISPOSITION OF DRUMS/PRODUCT IS PENDING.

THERE WAS NO PROTRUSIONS LOCATED ON THE PALLET FROM WHICH THE DRUM WAS SITTING, AND IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW THE DRUM BECAME PUNCTURED.  THE DRUM WAS PLACED INTO AN OVERPACK THE DRUM BECAME PUNCTURED.
