The BNSF train with entrained UTLX 205455 was stopped at the next available location awaiting BNSF and contract responders arrival to determine and cease the leak source. Responders reported that UTLX 205455's liquid valve was not fully closed and its camlock closure cap was not fully secured, which allowed commodity to escape at the liquid valve's closure. Responder's relieved internal pressure within UTLX 205455 which ended the active leak by 1850 hrs. CDT 9/05/2013. Responder's indicated that the liquid valve's operating handle contacted the interior of the valve housing cover when fully closed which forced the valve's operating handle to move beyond the valve stop and opened the ball valve. Responder's then closed the liquid valve, ensured that the valve's operating handle had sufficient clearance and secured the liquid valve's camlock closure by 1940 hrs. CDT 9/05/2013. Observed ground spillage was treated with a biodegradable compound for hydrocarbon remediation. UTLX 205455 along with six other rail cars that were impacted by commodity spray during train movement were set-out of the train at the next terminal for cleaning which was accomplished on 9/06/2013.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,Yes,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,10100,BNSF Railway Company,US,

He notified KCS environmental department and appropriate notifications were made from there and an emergency responder activated to remedy the leaking car.    The responder arrived on site and accessed the tank car. Upon further inspection of the car it was observed that the leak was caused by the top operated bottom outlet valve being leaft in the open position and the bottom outlet cap was not secured fully. Calumet Lubricants Co offered the car into transportation with the tank car appurtenance in the open position with the cap less than tight. The responder tightened the closures appropriately and cleaned up the residual product as necessary.    This incident, if not detected by KCS alert Laredo yard professionals, could have resulted in the release of an entire tank car of Petroleum Lube oil.     * No injuries reported    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:  The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O. Box 219335, Kansas City, MO 64121.  The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

Contractor reported that they located one 2.5 gallon pail in the trailer which was punctured by a sharp object. Contractor reported that the entire contents of the pail was released. Contractor reported that most of the freight on the pallet was impacted by the release. Therefore, the contractor removed the pails from the cardboard boxes. The pails had not been impacted but the cardboard boxes had been impacted. The pails were placed onto pallets for continued transit and the boxes are being placed into an overpack.

The driver stated that when he arrived at the customer, there were several vehicles near the customer installation area and he proceeded to get out and review the area for hazards so that he could safely back the transport.     After reviewing the hazards and placing his cones, the driver proceeded to re-enter the tractor and back the transport to the cones at the customer installation area. Once he was completed, the driver exited the tractor and proceeded to the back of the trailer to connect the delivery hose to the customer storage vessel. He stated that the pressure in the trailer was 5 psi and he started to cool the trailer's transfer pump and then tried to connect the delivery hose to the customer vessel when he realized he was approximately 6 inches short of the connection. At this time, the driver stated that the only valves that were open on the trailer were the Pump Inlet Valve and the Recert Valve.    After closing the rear trailer doors, the driver proceeded back to the tractor to move the transport. Before he was able to back, the driver had to move the transport approximately 25 feet due to a customer employee that needed to exit in his vehicle.    During the maneuvering of the transport to allow the customer employee to exit the parking area, the driver stated that the trailer valves he had opened prior to this remained open during his maneuvers in the transport (Pump Inlet Valve and the Recert Valve remained open).    Before the driver could complete his maneuvers of the transport to a closer position near the customer installation, he needed the customer to move another vehicle in the way. At approximately 10:25, he parked the transport and went into the customer office which is approximately 10 feet from the customer installation area.     At approximately 10:28, the driver exited the office to go back to the transport and he saw that the rupture disc on the trailer burst and there was product being released at the back of the trailer. The driver stated that the pressure in the trailer at the time of the rupture disc burst was approximately 35 psi and the Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) did not lift prior to the rupture disc bursting.","Instruct all drivers on how the valves should be positioned (open / close) in the trailer when the transport is driven, to include maneuvering at the customer site.       Add precaution to the Air Liquide unloading procedure that instructs all drivers on how the valves should be positioned (open / close) in the trailer when the transport is driven, to include maneuvering at the customer site.

The staff were evacuated for less than 45 minutes and the Chicago Fire Department ( ORD) was called. The Chicago Fire Department placed the plastic jerrican in a recovery drum, this was marked and later picked up by the consignee.   The drum was later examined and found to have no leaks or holes and the top cap appeared intact .When tipped the drum top did not further leak. Our conclusion was that the drum was overfilled ( shipper error) with not enough room for expansion of the liquid during flight altitude. The liquid leaked out of the top cap , the cap allowed the overfill to leak out , about 1 liter or less.   The shipper and consignee were contacted to see if they could confirm that the drum was overfilled ( for example examining the drum which had leaked )   The consignee ( Givaudan Flavors Corp 100 East 69th Street Cincinnati OHIO 45216 ) was not able to do this since the refused the shipment due to damage . The shipper was also Givaudan - address in report ( Germany)",We gave information to the customs broker ( DHL ) to advise the shipper and consignee ( both Givaudan ) to check these there process so that these shipments were not overfilled in the future as we did not believe there was any damage to the jerrican or any mishandling.

Contract responders inspecting the lading within OOLU 166758 reported finding one 55 gallon steel drum (located mid-section of this container on the bottom tier) with a small stress crack in a dented area towards its bottom sidewall. Responders also reported that the leak in the drum was contained by 1340 hrs. PDT, 9/24/2013 after this drum's crack was patched and drum placed into an over-pack drum. The cause of the drum's sidewall crack was suspected to be that the drum was dropped during or prior to container loading. All non-evaporated spillage was cleaned. The over-pack drum containing the compromised drum was earmarked to be returned to the commodity manufacturer.

The driver stated that the inner tire on the driver’s side rear axle blew causing sparks and smoke. The driver immediately proceeded to pull over to the side of the highway when the tire caught fire. Once stopped, the driver quickly got out of the tractor, took his fire extinguisher and went to the back of the trailer to fight the fire. He was able to initially extinguish the fire, however it started again and he proceeded to call 911 to report the incident.     Because of the heat, the pressure rose inside the Liquid Hydrogen Trailer and the Pressure Safety Valve (PSV) lifted releasing Hydrogen gas out of the vent stack into the atmosphere. The escaping Hydrogen gas ignited, causing a vent stack fire on the trailer. Louisiana Emergency Responders were able to extinguish the Vent Stack fire by using the trailers Helium Fire Abatement System, and the pressure inside the trailer decreased to below the PSV limit, however the PSV did not reseat causing Hydrogen gas to continue to slowly escape out of the vent stack. In order to get the pressure to a safe level, an Air Liquide employee was able to safely conduct a controlled venting of the trailer and brought the pressure down from approximately 170 psi to 3-5 psi.    Both North and South bound lanes of I-49 near Alexandria, LA (mile marker 63) were closed during the incident  - the controlled venting was completed at 1125 CST and the trailer was moved off of the interstate at 1405 CST.    Northbound traffic resumed at 1230 CST and Southbound resumed at 1410 CST.","Re-training on proper pre-trip inspections will be conducted, as well as ensuring that the required preventative maintenance is done on the transports at least once a month.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,60000,"Air Liquide Industrial, U.S. LP",US,

At 19:45 while on climbout from ORD to STL. Flight Attendants in the aft end of the aircraft began to smell a strong electrical burning odor and reported it to the cockpit.Flight 1159 declared an emergency and air interrupted back to ORD. Flight Attendants began querying customers inthe area of the smell about electronic devices and then began checking overhead binds. A smoldering briefcase was noted almost immediately in the overhead bin above row 26A&B. The Flight Attendants began fighting the fire with Halon fire extinguishers and put the fire out. They removed the briefcase to an empty serving cart from the galley and covered the briefcase with ice. Upon landing, the aircraft was stopped on the runway and met by ORD Crash,Fire, Rescue. They removed the bag from the aircraft. The aircraft then taxied to the gate and customers weredeplaned. The aircraft was N493, an MD80 and upon maintenance inspection no damage was found to the overhead bin.What was found in the briefcase that caused the fire was a spare lithium ion battery for a Nikon camera. The battery was 7.4V 12Wh. It was placed, by the passenger, in an outer pocket of the briefcase. In the outer pocket was alan yard of the type used for IDs to hang around a person's neck. The metal parts of the lanyard came into contact with the anode and cathode of the battery causing a short and driving the battery into thermal runaway.•","This continues to be a public education issue where more needs to be done to educate the travelling public on thedangers of lithium batteries and the precautions that should be taken, such as placing the spare battery in a plasticbag to protect it from shorting and removing metal objects before placing it in a carry-on bag.",No,OTHER,Passenger luggage on bus or aircraft,LUGGAGE,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.",US,
