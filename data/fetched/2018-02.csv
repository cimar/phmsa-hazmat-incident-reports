On 02/06/2018 at 0825, a CSX authorized contractor in the CSXT Demmler Yard discovered UTLX 644099, a loaded tank car of Environmentally Hazardous Substances, Liquid, N.O.S., leaking from the manway. The car was isolated and the FRA, NRC, and Shipper were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2018-0206-00044). HEPACO, LLC, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a less than hand tight vacuum relief device. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's contact, Mr. Joseph Eskra of The Lubrizol Corporation, phone 216-447-6374. Contractor personnel secured the vacuum relief device and removed all spilled material. The leak was secured and the car was released for transportation.

Luke informed Franco that he was out of hours for the day but could make the delivery Saturday.     At approximately 17:00 hours Skyler Rogers contacted Luke and instructed him to deliver the products knowing that Luke was out of hours for the day.    Luke loaded 8 drums onto trailer #75 and completed the first delivery at approximately 21:30 hours, travelled back to the Clariant yard and loaded two totes of KDO-5248S, approximately 550 gallons, then departed for the final delivery.    Shortly after travelling onto FM-307 Luke felt and observed the trailer swaying, applied the truck brakes, and the trailer collided into the rear of the truck. (NOTE: the trailer coupler had come loose from the trailer hitch on the truck and was being suspended by the safety chains) The impact ruptured one of the totes which spilled approximately 25 gallons of KDO-5248S (NOTE: No reportable quantities released) onto the highway.     Luke contacted Skyler Rogers and informed him that his trailer had come off his truck. Skyler and Landon Gone arrived on scene and noticed the trailer tongue under the rear of the truck and one of the totes was releasing chemical onto the ground. Skyler contacted CHEMTREC and instructed Oscar Franco to go to the Clariant yard to pick up an empty tote so the contents of the damaged tote could be transferred.    Brian Tennis, Midland Fire Department, CHEMTREC and EH&S Remediation was notified.    Luke, Brian Tennis, Skyler Rogers and Landon Gone remained on scene until the site was remediated.    Luke was issued the following citations (TX53K00VBALS) from Texas Department of Public Safety:  • Failure to mark ID number on bulk package – no 1993 on trailer or placards  • Improper description of mixture (technical names) – no technical names  • Incorrect packing group listed – has packing group III listed when it’s a packing group II  • Failure to enter basic description in proper sequence – industry name listed first, packing group listed before hazard class  • Improper description of hazardous material on shipping paper – no UN# listed  • IBC manufacturer markings – none on 1 tote  • IBC protection test dates – none on 1 tote  • Leaking/release of hazardous material package – leaking due to damage    During Wade Smith’s interview with Luke Sims, Luke was asked if he had used the truck for personal use and Luke stated, “No”. Luke stated that he had used the truck numerous times pulling trailers and never had an issue.    An investigation of the trailer ball on the truck showed that it was 2 inch ball. All of the 16 foot utility conversion trailers are equipped with a 2 5/16 coupler hitch and the standard delivery trailers are equipped with a 2 inch coupler hitch.",Perform a thorough JSA  Perform a thorough pre-trip inspection of the vehicle and trailer  Improve employee ability to recognize existing or potential hazardous conditions  Review job procedures for hazard avoidance  Send out a Safety Alert,Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,14500,Clariant Corporation,US,

Substantial damage was done to the right side of the tractor and right side of the cargo tank.  The rock wall ruptured the cargo tank which allowed almost all of the cargo to be spilled.  The force of the impact caused the internal bulkheads to breach which allowed the product to flow out of the holes torn into the side of the cargo tank.  The Kentucky EPA responded and dispatched Ecotech emergency response to the scene.  Extensive efforts were made to mitigate the release of product into the environment.

He notified the Brewster Yard Master who then contacted myself, John Vergis Environmental Officer for the WLE.  I came out to inspect the car and when I got on top the car, I noticed that the safety pin for the protective housing lid was not installed but hanging by its chain.  I also noticed that the seal, number 36518 was in place but had been cut.  I opened the housing Lid and noticed that the rubber cover that is to cover the pressure relief device was taken off and laying to the side.  I reinstalled the cover on the PRD.  I checked all the valves to see what was leaking and noticed that the vapor valve was leaking through the valve plug.  I tried the valve handle to see if it was loose and it was.  I tightened the valve handle and the leak stopped.  I looked to see if the valve plug was loose but it was not, it was tool tight but the thread sealant was not sufficient to prevent a leak.  I took the valve plug out and reinstalled thread sealant and then reinstalled the valve plug.  I installed a new seal on the housing lid, seal number 971787.  I then released the car for service.

The driver immediately pulled over and saw that the tank gauge device had broken, and had developed a leak. The quick thinking driver immediately placed the tanker under vacuum, which ended the release. The driver then used packing material, threaded rod and a nut to effect a stable repair. The highway police did stop and assess the situation and found that since the actual release was a small amount, the day very windy, and the acetone quick to evaporate, there was nothing on the road way or vehicle to clean up. The tank continued to the nearby intended destination without further incident. After the tank was unloaded, it was sent for a permanent repair and retesting.     Later investigation revealed that the tank gauge mechanism had recently been replaced, and that design of the replacement was prone to loosening and coming undone.     This release was reported to the state: NJ DEP 11:27EST 18-02-05-1128-20 Operator #69.","At the time this tanker was placed into transportation, there was no evidence of a leak or mechanical issue.

Jeff was traveling westbound on US highway 30. Speed limit 55 mph. Jeff was approximately 2 miles west of Grand Junction, IA in Greene County at the crossroad intersection of US 30 and Green County Rd P33/S. Ave.    The weather was cloudy with a very light snow falling. Jeff, looking at the intersection seeing a white pickup Eastbound coming towards him. As Jeff pass the intersection (S. Ave.) he suddenly feels an impact /jolt to his truck, as he looks in the driver’s side mirror, he sees a fireball and he sees his trailer on the highway skidding behind and to his left in the Eastbound lane. Somewhat shocked he steers to the right shoulder/north side of highway 30. As he is doing this, the trailer goes past him. Jeff jumps out of his truck cab and is fearful the pickup coming towards him gets stopped and calls 911. Jeff runs towards his burning trailer. – The pickup following Jeff westbound for an unknown reason.    The pickup following Jeff for unknown reason ended up in the ditch behind our trailer. Jeff saw that the right front wheel had extensive damage. We can only assume it hit debris on the highway from the other truck. There was a front axle, engine, and transmission on the highway that came from the other truck.    One of the first on the scene was another one of Sully’s owner-operators, John Schneider. John was behind the eastbound pickup by about a half minute. As John came upon the accident, not knowing what just happened and sees a truck on the westbound shoulder/north side of the highway and did not recognize what was burning in the ditch on the south side of the highway. As John got close and saw the Sully logo on the tank and then looked ahead and saw the 4” orange gasoline drop hose lying in the middle of the highway, then he knew it was a gasoline tanker. At 9:58 am John called Brent and asked if I was aware of this and I said no & John said it looked like our truck was “T-boned” by a livestock truck.     John was unaware the Sully drivers (Jeff Mercer’s) truck tractor was the truck on the westbound side of the highway at this point the fire was big enough John could not tell if the truck tractor was or was not hooked to the trailer.  Brent asked John to park his truck a safe distance and find out what exactly had happened and to call him back in 5 minutes.     Brent found out from dispatch who the driver was and what exactly he had loaded. He had loaded 8300 gals of gasohol (gasoline with ethanol).  In the meantime, John found our driver, Jeff Mercer, safe. He took a few photos and sent them to dispatch so as to not tie up my phone. He did not have anything else to report except that the driver of the pickup was in the fire but that the driver was now safe. The driver of the livestock truck had been ejected from his truck cab and was alive and that was all he knew. By this time responders",I do not think there is anything that Sully Transport can do to prevent an accident such as this one.

Upon his arrival, on Sunday morning, the driver checked in with Security, and as Brenntag Northeast was not operating at the time, was directed to drop the trailer in a specified area, for future unloading by Brenntag personnel.  On the morning of February 12, 2018, during routine operations, at approximately 07:10, a Brenntag Northeast contractor discovered that the trailer was leaking. He immediately reported this to Brenntag Northeast personnel. Brenntag Northeast personnel identified the leak as being at the rear of the trailer and laid absorbents throughout the areas impacted by the spill and diked the storm drains. Senior Management was notified.  The product was off loaded from the leaking trailer into another empty trailer Brenntag had on-site. CURA, Brenntag’s on call response and remediation contractor was called to perform the clean-up. PADEP was notified. DANA Transport, the carrier involved, was notified of the situation.  After unloading of the leaking trailer, Brenntag was able to assess the cause of the leak. The eight bolts connecting the outlet valve to the flange of the trailer were only hand tight, which allowed the material to leak from the flange.  Brenntag is unable to estimate the length of the release, as the weather from the time it was delivered until just before discovery was raining and foggy. During the cleanup weather was clear.  CURA sent a response and remediation contractor to the site, which cleaned up the absorbents, and assessed if any remediation was necessary. Remediation of the asphalt area where the material had leaked was required and completed the next day.","Brenntag Northeast personnel met February 12, 2018, to assess the incident and see if there was anything we could do to prevent or minimize this type of incident in the future.  It was decided that going forward, any transports entering the site will be scrutinized more closely by the Security team to assess if anything is leaking at the time of arrival.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,29453,"BRENNTAG NORTHEAST, LLC",US,

It was reported that a Trimac tractor tanker (470409) was found with a leak coming from the piping near the belly valve. Approximately 1 gallon dripped to the soft gravel below. No drains or waterways were impacted by the release and the release has been secured by on site personnel. 1215 ERTS coordinated with a network contractor, Hazchem, who provided a 2 hour ETA. A DOT5800 is required due to the PGI and container size. No further reporting shall be conducted at this time.    1519 ET: Contractor has finished their assessment of the tanker. It was possible that a pipe leading to the leaking valve may have contained residual product resulting in the release. The pipe ran a significant portion of the tanker. The contractor emptied approximately 20 gallons of material into a drum from the pipe at the back end. Once the pipe was emptied, the leak initially stopped. Shortly after, the valve began to leak again. The contractor suspects that the internal safety valve is malfunctioned/damaged. Contractor reports that the tanker is not fit to be moved. ERTS will coordinate with Chad Jacobs with Trimac to determine the next course of action.     1540 ET: ERTS has coordinated with the contractor and spoken with Chad Jacobs. The contractor will return Monday morning (Exact time to be determined) to conduct a tanker transfer. The contractor will secure the valve the best the can with puddy and absorbent pads. A containment area will be created around the valve in the event the securement fails. The valve is slow leaking and is not anticipated to leak outside the valve and containment area. There are two tankers onsite that can be used as transfer tankers. All parties involved understand the plan.     The impacted gravel/soil around the leaking valve has been hand dug. The area around the valve has been wiped down.    Waste Count:  (1) 55 gallon metal drum containing 20 liquid gallons of product.  (1) 55 gallon metal drum containing impacted absorbents/soil/gravel.    All waste has been staged on site as the drums will be still used for Monday's transfer.

The spill was originating from damage to the bottom of a 330 gallon tote.  Weight of this tote full was indicated to be 3376 lbs prior to the spill, gallons not determined but estimated at close to full and less than 330.  The spilled material was a waste material (DOT Shipping Name: UN2924, Waste Flammable Liquids, Corrosive, n.o.s. (Isopropanol, Formic Acid), 3 (8), PGIII, RQ(D002)[Used Weighted Formic Acid and Wash Water].  This material spilled onto the floor of the trailer and then out of the side of the trailer onto the ground.  The tote was being unloaded from a trailer by forklift, Root Cause indicates Forklift Operator error resulted in tote puncture and spill of material.    Multiple lines of boom and absorbent  placed to halt the spread of spilled material, sandbags placed in nearby ditch to prevent material spread if the event of boom and absorbent breach occurred.  Notification was made to Louisiana State Police, LSP Incident# 18-00680 was issued.  Local Fire and Hazmat Teams came onsite to ensure the situation was contained.  LDEQ came onsite to ensure that the spill was contained and appropriately remediated.  Emergency Spill response company USES arrived onsite at approx 6:30 pm to begin assessing and delineating spill affected area, recover, and decontaminate affected areas.","Forklift operators underwent post incident retraining on forklift operations topics including: Proper use of lighting, movement visibility, use of spotter when necessary, forklift movement around containers and preventing damage.",Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,30,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,13597,"LEI, Inc.",US,

In the process of making a delivery, the driver was stopped at a traffic light in Diamond Bar, CA at approximately 1:15 PM when he heard a loud bang and observed flames emitting from the trailer behind him. The driver immediately exited the tractor, signaled people in the immediate vicinity to move to a safe location, and called 9-1-1 from a nearby parking lot. Emergency services and Air Products personnel worked to put out the fire, isolate the leaking tubes, and depressurize the tubes to allow for transportation of the trailer to an Air Products facility. At approximately 3:00 AM on Feb 12th, the venting of the trailer tubes was completed, emergency responders left scene, and a tow truck was dispatched to move the trailer to the Air Products Santa Fe Springs Terminal.  Upon visual inspection of the failed trailer, damage was observed on multiple tubes and it was identified that seven (7) pressure relief device (PRD) assemblies on the back of the trailer were ejected from their corresponding tubes. The subsequent investigation identified the following preliminary root causes for the failure: (1) one of the PRDs [ejected from tube #14] was found to have the incorrect pressure rating, 5,833 psi vs the correct 10,000 psi [with a trailer operating pressure of 7,500 psi], (2) compression fittings on the PRD discharge vent piping were assembled incompletely.   The incident investigation is currently ongoing to finalize the root causes and corrective actions.","As an immediate action, Air Products performed a 100% inspection of all vehicles constructed with the same specification cylinder to identify/replace any incorrectly rated PRDs and repair any incorrectly assembled compression fittings.  In addition, the following items have been put in place to ensure PRDs and fittings are correctly installed following requalification.     Air Products implemented 100% quality inspection of its vendors' work with particular focus on PRD set point and vent tube assembly.     Detailed work instructions were developed in conjunction with the third party requalification facility to ensure trailers have correctly rated PRDs and correctly installed vent piping following a requalification.",Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,200500,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",US,

They pulled over and walked the 30"" A-line in the area and did not see any leaks where the oil was coming from at the time.  One of the supervisors contacted US Ecology (IMTT's OSRO)who dispatched a vacuum truck to remove approximately 25 gallons of oil and water mixture. After removing the water and oil mixture it became apparent that the leak had not stopped.  At this point the decision was made to evacuate the remaining product in the line and start excavating under the line to determine the source of the leak.  The initial excavation had to stop due to the fact the line was run under an adjacent roadway within the terminal.  The roadway was blocked off and additional equipment brought in to extract the pipeline.  Upon inspection it was determined that exterior corrosion on the line caused the leak.",IMTT conducted a Root Cause Analysis and determined that several factors lead to the pin-hole sized leak in the line.  These included: 1.) The pipe was inside a sleeve and run under the roadway.  2.) The pipe was installed pre-1970's and was not coated and had no cathodic protection.  3.) The pipe was subjected to vibration during use over a long time period.  Preventative measures include: Running the new section of pipe above ground on supports and grout and cap the old sleeve; Prime and paint the new section of pipe; Install marine boards on the new supports to prevent metal to metal contact.  The re-installation of the pipe will meet all PHMSA requirements.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,30000,IMTT,US,

He immediately hit the ESO on t eh remote shutting the bobtail down.After activating the ESV he check to see if the leak stopped. when it did not he called his district manager for further instructions. The district manager then called Industrial Propane Service to fix the leak. when they arrived they were able to get leak stopped. It is estimated that no more than 25 gallons of liquid was lost. The remaining propane was pumped off into storage using a compressor. The head of a bolt broke off on a flange between the high-pressure side of the pump and supply piping to the meter causing that seal between to leak. That was the main cause of the leak for the release. The truck has been taken out of service. No injuries, no property damage.",The employee is a new employee that was the last one to do a meter creep on this bobtail.

While pulling up he stretched the hose and it ripped it apart and the fuel continued to flow while the driver tried to exit the truck and stop fuel spill. The driver is being terminated for false information. The local fire department arrived on scene and spread sand. Action Environmental was contacted to manage the spill cleanup.     Gasoline spilled onto the concrete driveway surface and appears to have flowed into an onsite drainage system. The drainage system was later determined to be part of a designed storm water management system that collects all storm water from the site and passes it through an oil/water separator before being discharged offsite. FCE eventually found the opening to the oil/water separator and determined that the gasoline was contained in the separator. Based on Action’s request, FCE determined that no gasoline had impacted any soil. Further, there was no impact to any water way.",Eagle Transport Corporation discharged this driver for not following company policy.

Outbound was unclear of how much actually spilled out ofthe box and Hazmat was left for A.M. QA to solve. The inspection of the interior shows that one of the cans was dented near the center of the Pain Can side wall which resulted in the content leaking out over the rest of the content inside the box.    New Comments:  The package was discovered by our Outbound Crew and left for AM QA to process.
