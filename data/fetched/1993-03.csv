AT AROUND SCHROEDER MINNESOTA HE OBSERVED THAT IT WAS SNOWING AND BY THE TIME HE PASSED THROUGH TOFTE HE DECIDED TO PULL OFF THE ROAD AND WAIT OUT THE STROM.  APPROXIMATELY TWO MILES NORTH OF TOFTE HE OBSERVED A SIGN FOR A REST AREA AHEAD ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD.  HE SLOWED HIS VEHICLE TO A CRAWL AND STARTED TO ENTER THE REST AREA WHEN HE FELT A TUG FROM THE RIGHT REAR OF THE TRAILER.  WHEN HE LOOKED IN HIS MIRROR HE NOTICED THAT THE TRAILER WHEELS WERE SLIDING TO THE RIGHT DOWN A BANK AND THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER STARTED PULLING BACKWARD.  THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER BOTH ROLLED OVER LANDING ON THE ROOF.  THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT CAUSED THE WINDOWS ON THE TRUCK TO POP OUT.  THE DRIVER THEN TURNED OFF THE LIGHTS AND IGNITION AND CRAWLED OUT.  ONCE CLEAR OF THE CAB THE DRIVER NOTICED THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER WERE ON FIRE.  HE ATTEMPTED TO RETRIEVE THE EXTINGUISHER BUT COULD NOT REACH IT.  AS HE CLIMBED BACK ONTO THE HIGHWAY A VEHICLE CAME ALONG WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE THE SON OF THE FIRE WARDEN.  HE CLIMBED INTO THE VEHICLE AND THEY DROVE A QUARTER MILE TO THE FIRE WARDENS HOUSE.  THE TOFTE AND OTHER AREA FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT.  THE FUEL FROM THE TANKER FLOWED DOWN A DITCH TOWARDED LAKE SUPERIOR CAUSING A FEW TREES TO BURN AS WELL AS SOME GRASS AND SHRUB BRUSH.  AT SOME POINT THE DECISION WAS MADE TO LET THE FUEL BURN RATHER THAN LET IT FLOW INTO THE LAKE.  A CALL WAS PLACED TO MURPHY OIL AND THEY CONTACTED OSI TO RESPOND TO THE SPILL.  THE MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY WAS CONTACTED AND THEY CALLED IN THE COAST GUARD AS WELL AS DISPATCHING A REPRESENTATIVE FROM MINNEAPOLIS.  THE COAST GUARD WAS LATER CANCELLED.  THE OSI TEAM RESPONDED AND CONTACTED A LOCAL EQUIPMENT OPERATOR TO DIG SEVERAL DITCHES WHERE THEY PLACED BOOMS TO CONTROL ANY FUEL THAT WAS HEADING FOR LAKE SUPERIOR.  THEY THEN CONTINUED TO CONTAIN THE AREA AND PROCEEDED WITH THE CLEANUP.  THEY WERE INFORMED AT THE SCENE TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR CLEANUP TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY.
