POOLE,OWNER,3763 Longmire Way,Doraville,GA,30340,Carrier,"Our driver was delivering diesel from our tanker to an above ground tank using a pump attached to our truck.  Upon connecting the hoses and fittings, the driver did not make sure the ears on the hose were properly secured.  The driver engaged the PTO to pump the product off of our tanker and within fifteen seconds our hose disconnected from the pump fitting and product was released into the immediate area.  The driver ran back around to the front of the truck and immediately shut off the pump.  It is estimated that approximately 80-100 gallons were released.  The product ran about sixty feet into a storm drain, which empties out into an on-site detention pond.  The pond had a significant amount of water in it and all of the product released was contained inside of the detention pond.  Spill pads and aborbent booms were used to help contain the product within the detention pond.  A vac truck was used to recapture the product from the detention pond and storm drain.","We utilize locking ears on our pump hoses to prevent such incidents from occurring.  The driver knew that the ears on the hose he was using were not operating correctly and didn't report it to anyone to have them repaired.  He chose to continue using the hose even though the ears were not locking into place.  In addition, he did not make sure the ears were secured in a closed position before beginning the pump off.  The cause of the incident was human error.  The driver is being reprimanded with a suspension and will be retrained on the proper use of our equipment.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8360,Keystone Petroleum Transport,US,

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder was immediately notified to inspect AMCX 25813. The responder reported intact seal INEOS 127396 was removed from the valve housing cover to determine the source of the product leak. Detailed inspection revealed the leak source was the liquid valve's closure plug that was not tool tight. The responder tool tightened this closure plug (3/4 turn) ending this product release by 0118 hrs. CDT, 4/02/2011. All other valves and fittings were found secure. The pooled spillage at the base of the valves was absorbed by a sorbent pad. The small amount of spillage on the top shell near the valve housing area was wiped. No ground impact was observed. The valve housing cover was closed, but not immediately resealed, since this responder planned to recheck AMCX 25813 during daylight hours.  No further product leaks were detected during this latter inspection. The valve housing cover was closed and then sealed with seal BNSF Haz Mat 001266.

FSTZ 883012 was deramped from its intermodal flatcar that it was riding upon and taken to the facility's containment area. The shipper was notified and sent a response contractor to investigate the leak source and remediate spillage. The contractor reported that one 5 gallon steel pail found towards the rear of the trailer's lading had buckled and incurred a bottom seam failure. The buckling was caused by heavy freight stacked atop the pail. The contractor cleaned the dried and semi-dried paint to an acceptable level and the lading within was adjusted.

A response contractor was called and inspected NATX 302246 in the containment pit. All seals were intact and all fittings were secure.

Approx. 0.5 miles South of SR307 in Tunkhannock Twp, Wyoming County, PA, truck drifted onto right shoulder of paved highway and upon correcting to return to the pavement the right rear of the truck pulled to the right causing impact with rock cliffs at edge of right shoulder resulting in rupture of rear compartment. Damage to the tank began at mid-tank as an indentation/scratch on passenger-side tank shell and continued to the back of tank where it caused an 8"" separation of the tank shell from end-cap resulting in leak.  Driver checked right rear-view mirror after impact and noticed fuel leaking from tank.  Driver proceeded approx. 0.5 miles to a ""safe haven"", stopped truck, called emergency personnel and contained the spill.  Tunkhannock Twp. Fire & Rescue, PA Dept. of Environmental Protection, and Wyoming County EMA attended the scene, contained the leak, cleaned up immediate area, and emptied tank compartment of all contents.  A spill rememdiation team was called in to clean scene in its entirety and company truck was returned to company yard.","We have added a component to our driver safety training for all drivers which addresses road conditions, road deterioration hazards and safe driving area on roads (keeping away from berms/ditches/etc).          ***Per report description, failure code (Causes of Failure)changed from 516 to 537***",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,44008,FLYNN ENERGY TRANSPORT INC.,US,

The IMTT Operator went to the back of the trailer compartment and noticed that both the internal and external valves were left open.  The IMTT Operator immediately closed both valves and notified his supervisor.  EQ Terminal Services was dispatched to the area and cleaned up the affected areas of the trailer compartment and loading rack.  The clean up operation was completed by 1545 hours and the loading operation resumed without further incident.  The National Response Center and US Coast Guard were notified of the incident due to the release being in excess of the reportable quantity which is 13 gallons.",As part of IMTT's ISO-9000 procedure there is a check list that requires that the IMTT Operator and Linden driver verify that all unused outlet valves are closed prior to loading.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Equistar Chemicals LP was notified via CHEMTREC report 2011-04-13-00023. Summit Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the thermometer well cap to be less than hand tight, emitting odor and the bottom outlet valve packing nut was less than tool tight. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative. Summit Environmental personnel secured the thermometer cap and the shipper contracted Rescar to secure the bottom outlet valve. The leak was stopped and the car was released for transport.     This incident did require several special switching moves.  A QA 7.1 Non conformance report is not required for this incident.

Service Manger Hampton determined that the cardboard box had been placed on its side during loading, resulting in the release. The majority of the released product was absorbed into the foam packaging material in the box, and the box was slightly damp with gasoline.

The leak rate was approximately 1 drip every 10 seconds. The leak was immediately secured and the rail car was moved into a licensed facility within the controlled area of the Clive Facility. Radiological surveys of the rail car and rail track identified no radioactive contamination. The National Response Center and shipper were notified. Further inspections were performed on April 7, 2011. The drain cap was removed and the liquid in the rail car was allowed to flow into a sump. Approximately 1400 gallons was drained from the rail car. The waste material in the railcar was metal debris. The total volume of the rail car is 6275 cuft and the volume of the waste material in the rail car was 5000 cuft.The shipper was interviewed during the time period of the rail car inspection. The shipper indicated that the rail car was loaded during a rain storm but, did not know that a significant amount of liquid collected in the rail car.The rail car unloaded on April 16, 2011. There were no further discrepancies identified.",Our Quality Assurance Department has requested a corrective action plan from the shipper.

These railcars were setout in an isolated area at Eldon Jct. station (UPRR Baytown Subdiv.). BNSF and contract responders inspected PPGX 1426. An audible vapor hiss was detected as responders approached PPGX 1426. Contract responders reported finding the A-end liquid valve partially open with its closure plug not tool tight. Responders closed the liquid valve by 2309 hrs. CDT, 4/28/2011 which ended the vapor hiss and the odor dissipated thereafter. Further inspection of all other valves revealed that they were 1/2 turn from being fully closed.

The release was contained on the asphalt and did not impact any drainage.  The federal reportable quantity threshold of 1000 pounds was not met however; the release was required to be reported to the State.     AWARENESS ITEM:   1. The meter was set at 4000 gallons but overflowed at 3903 gallons.   2. The pump and meter involved in this release is Shipper owned.   3. The pump has been in use at the terminal since 2003.  The meter has only needed to be changed out four times in that time period.   4. The meter was changed out two weeks prior to release.   5. Meter was reset at the beginning of this transfer and appeared to be in functioning order.   6. This was the first peroxide load of the day.   7. Severe weather at the terminal caused a power line at the end of the terminal to ground out which could have possibly shorted out the meter’s program board, per discussion with Shipper and TRANSFLO.",CORRECTIVE ACTION:   1.

CELLUCCI,"VICE PRESIDENT, TRANSPORTAITON COMPLIANCE",42 Longwater Drive,Norwell,MA,02061,Carrier,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services (CHES) was transporting a bulk load of filter cake from a customer located in Fort Lupton, CO destined for Clean Harbor's Deer Trail disposal facility located in Deer Trail, CO.  During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at CHES’ Kimball Nebraska facility to obtain rest before continuing on to the intended waste management facility. The bulk load contained approximately 25 cubic yards of filter cake in a roll-off box equipped with a soft top tarp system.      At the time of the accident, the driver was heading southbound on Highway 71 between Mile Markers 210-211, approximately 8 miles North of Stoneham, Colorado, when the truck went of the road on the west side.  The tractor and roll off trailer came to rest upright off the road and during the time the driver attempted to recover and return to the roadway, the roll-off box broke free from the trailer and flipped upside down depositing the filter cake in a pile that measured approximately 108’ by 33’ including thinly spread material.  The bulk of the material was deposited in a pile that was about three times the footprint of the roll-off box. The material released was a dry solid and as such was contained on the dirt and grass land abutting the highway.  Please note there were no waterways or storm drains impacted by this incident. The power unit and trailer did not roll-over as a result of the incident.      Emergency services were immediately dispatched to the scene as were representatives from the CO state Police, Emergency Services and an internal Clean Harbor's response Team.  Upon arrive, the driver was removed from the scene and treated/released with minor injuries.  The spill scene was secured and a response action was initiated to remove the vehicle and initiate clean-up activities.  IN addition, all required notifications were made to the US EPA, Colorado State Police, The Colorado Department of Transportation and the Colorado Department of Public Health.    Over the next 2 days, clean -up and remediation activities were conducted under the direction of Clean Harbors Environmental Services and routine updates were communicated to the applicable State Agencies.  In addition to the recovery of all spilled material, Clean Harbors Generated approximately 18 cubic yards of additional spill debris that was properly containerized and sent for disposal to a full permitted waste management facility.  Prior to departing the scene, the impacted surface area was backfilled with a sufficient amount of soil to return the area to the appropriate grade.","During the initial investigation, it was determined that the primary cause of the release was attributed to the abnormally high wind activity.  It is believed that the vehicle encountered a gust of wind that pushed the vehicle towards the soft shoulder.  The driver attempted to correct the path of the vehicle but was unable to recover resulting in the vehicle catching the soft shoulder.  The force of the impact with the soft shoulder caused the roll-off container to violently shift allowing the front securement devices to fail resulting in the box coming off the roll-off frame.  Though we believe environmental factors were the primary cause of the event, the driver involved in this event, along with his local peers will be retrained on proper load securement requirements so as to insure that each container is properly blocked and braced during transportation.",Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,76500,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

This tote was banded to a pallet and had sufficient absorbent material to absorb the entire contents in the event of a spill or leak.    In our internal investigation, we found that the BET station agent, whose training is  current, had failed to thoroughly inspect the shipment. The documentation, marking and labeling was correct and was noted on the checksheet that is used for accepting hazardous material shipments, however it was the packaging that was improper. This battery was placed into the plastic tote filled with vermiculite and banded to a pallet. The battery was not packed in a fiberboard box inside the plastic tote.    This freight had already flown from BET to ANC.    Immediate actions were to obtain photographs of the improperly packaged hazardous  material (attached) and begin an internal investigation. We also have embargoed  hazardous material shipments from this station until we can be assured that all steps are taken to minimize our exposure to improperly prepared hazardous material shipments.     According to the statements from the BET station, this shipment was declared but was not scrutinized as thoroughly as it should have been and it appears that some assumptions were made.    Below is the response given by the BET station agent regarding this shipment.    -------------------------------------    Thank You and Take Care.  Heather A Pike  Bethel Station Manager  907-444-7811  Sent from Samsung Mobile    Heather,      This email is in refrence to the hazmat shipment for LKDS that was shipped out of the Bethel station. I do remember this shippment. I remember the haz-dec being correct. I remember filling out the checklist. I remember needing to go out and re sticker the shippment as far as haz- mat labels goes. I dont, however, remember if i actually did that or not. I do remember that the battery was in a white plastic tub that was eventually banded to a pallet. I was under the assumption that the plastic tub was an acceptable type of container. Now, i do not have any of the paperwork in front of me at this time to be able to refrence it, do to the fact that i am on my vacation on the east coast. Please let me know if you would like to know anything else. Have a great day.

This embargo will be in effect until a new procedure can be  implemented which we are working on which will be completed in the near future that  will affect not only BET, but all scheduled destinations that we service in Alaska.     We will be contacting all stations in an effort to enhance awareness to all of the aspects of a hazardous material shipment including the new procedures to be in place as soon as possible. Some of these awareness points are; looking for undeclared hazardous materials, ensuring the shipments that do contain hazardous materials, that they are scrutinized thoroughly, the importance of using the checklists provided and if there are any questions to ensure that these questions are asked and answered.

While traveling on Highway 80 eastbound, driver swerved to avoid a third party vehicle, which caused tote to break away from restraining straps on trailer, and fall to the roadway.  Entire contents of the 500 gallon poly tote were released to the asphalt roadway and soil within the median.  Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ALDEM) was contacted, and responded to the site, along with Alabama Department of Transportation (ADOT).  One (1) eastbound lane of Highway 80, and one (1) westbound lane of Highway 80 were shut down as a result of the accident.  United States Environmental Services (USES) of Alabaster, Alabama was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Working at the direction of ALDEM and ADOT, USES neutralized the phosphoric acid on the asphalt roadway, and used a granular sorbent to recover residual product.  Neutralized product and granular absorbent material were swept to the roadside, and stockpiled, pending excavation of soils.  USES returned to the site during daylight hours to excavate the impacted soil from the median, which was containerized into rolloff boxes, along with spent absorbents, pending disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.

Unloading hose was connected and preparation for transfer of Nitric acid begun. Internal valve was opened hydraulically. Immediately Nitric Acid began leaking from flange of discharge line (spool pipe).     Internal valve closed, container placed under spool pipe flange to contain Nitric Acid, driver notifies Action Resources, Inc dispatcher and ER coordinator Theresa Posey at ~22:20, Theresa Posey notified TX terminal Mgr. Calvin Lewis at ~ 22:30.    Driver determines location of leak to be 10mm-15mm hole in welded joint between spool tube and flange.    TX terminal mechanic Rick Bellamy has replacement part fabricated at Brenner Tank shop in Houston and departs Houston for El Dorado.

Equipment    • Failure of weld between flange and spool pipe determined to be dissimilar metals joined by weld. Flange was fabricated from some grade of mild steel and welded to stainless spool pipe. This determination was made by applying a magnet to the flange and the spool pipe. The flange is magnetically attractive while the stainless spool pipe is not. Type 316 austenitic Stainless Steel is not normally magnetic and can only be made slightly so by cold-working or machining. This will cause a very slight transformation of a small portion of the austenitic to ferritic or martenitic stainless steel, which can be very weakly attracted to a magnetic field.  •   Tank #C7243 was leased from Jack Olsta Co. Houston Terminal Mgr, Calvin Lewis, c","Action Resources, Inc. has begun inspecting all flanges in acid service with a magnet on the assumption that almost all 316SS is non-magnetic.

The train crew inspected their train and found tank car TCIX 21147 leaking product at the A-end tank head.  BNSF responders applied a magnetic patch over a small corrosion hole that had developed approximately 4 inches below the center point of the tank head. This stopped the flow of product from the corrosion hole by 1030 hrs. MDT, 4/20/2011. The suspected cause of the tank head compromise was an interior liner failure. Responders neutralized spillage that had started to pool under the tank car; and performed ground impact sampling.   Responders began the transfer of product from TCIX 21147 into another suitable tank car that had been positioned on an adjacent track next to TCIX 21147. The product transfer was completed by 2340 hrs MDT, 4/20/2011 without further incident.  Air monitoring was initiated earlier in the day and continued until the product transfer was completed. No air quality issues were noted. In the morning of 4/21/2011, responders removed the applied magnetic patch and sealed the corrosion hole with another temporary patch and secured this patch for movement of TCIX 21147. FRA Verbal Approval 110421R6V was received to move TCIX 21147 from Monument to the BNSF railyard at Denver, CO.  Local authorities initiated an evacuation of approximately 250 households in the Monument area until 2030 hrs MDT, 4/20/2011 with the exception of the nearby households adjacent to the track area where TCIX 21147 was located. The remaining households were allowed back at 2200 hrs. MDT, 4/20/2011. The local school district cancelled classes for the day and an elementary school was used as an evacuation center.

UTLX 202891 was carefully isolated in the railyard with containment under the leak source area. BNSF responders from mechanical and operating disciplines managed to significantly slow the rate of product release at the BOV. The leak source appeared to be from the BOV mounting flange/tank connection, possibly caused by either a defective mounting flange gasket or a gasket not compatible to the lading inside UTLX 202891. The nearby shipper was contacted and their representative's inspection confirmed the need to transfer product out of UTLX 202891. The shipper arranged to transfer product from UTLX 202891 into tank trucks starting early morning of 4/23/2011. The lading transfer was accomplished without further incident. Afterwards, the product drips ceased. UTLX 202891 is scheduled to be directed to a qualified repair facility once a FRA Movement Approval is received.   No ground impact was observed after responders inspected railyard locations for spillage from UTLX 202891.

Evidence at the scene indicated that the driver overcorrected his steering in an attempt to re-enter the roadway. This caused the vehicle to rotate in a counter clockwise motion, resulting in the load (aviation fuel and herbicide) in the cargo tanks to shift. The truck then overturned on its right side and slid across US 231 and collided with a ditch and mailbox. After impact with the ditch the truck then rotated clockwise and came to rest. The truck started leaking through the vent holes and the manhole covers. The crew used absorbent snakes and dry absorbent material to contain the spill and a portable holding tank was brought in to catch the leaking material. The Alabama DOT arrived and shut down the road and began dumping dirt on the spill with a front end loader to help absorb the material. A suction tanker from Eagle SWS arrived and removed the remaining liquid from the tanker. Approximately 300 gallons of Jet A and 1300 gallons of mixed herbicide were removed from the tank. There was originally 325 gallons of jet A and 1500 gal of herbicide mix on the truck prior to the accident. The total spill was estimated at 225 to 250 gallons. The spill entered a ditch approximately 100 feet from the tanker and a DOT employee stated that it was a roadside ditch and did not enter into any flowing water. The tank on the truck was not punctured, leakage occurred through the manhole covers.     The driver of the truck was given a field sobriety test and was arrested for driving under the influence. He later had a BAC of .14%.",This accident was a result of a driver who chose to drive a vehicle while intoxicated. He had been through a treatment program and was given a second chance and obviously was not rehabilitated. Additional training for our supervisors on how to identify drivers who are under the influence of drugs and or alcohol will be conducted.

Notification was also made to Jim Root with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).  This follow-up written notification was completed pursuant to Title 29, Section 430.70 of Illinois State regulations.    The release occurred within Norfolk Southern’s (NSRC) rail yard located at 1735 East Convit Ave., Decatur, IL in Macon County.  Norfolk Southern personnel observed material leaking from one US Ecology railcars (CHUX128) in the Decatur rail yard.   They contacted their emergency responder, Bodine, Inc to respond to the release.  Bodine notified US Ecology, at which time US Ecology authorized its emergency response contractor, Environmental Management, Inc. to work directly with Bodine to contain and correct the situation.  The cause of spill/leak was due to the inner liners within the flexible bulk containers not gathered and closed appropriately, allowing liquids to leak from the top of the containers into the cars.  Bodine conducted the following activities to respond to and contain the release:   - Vacuumed out spilled liquids in the gondola  - Removed all spill material from the rail ballast and replaced with clean ballast  - Removed flexible bulk containers from gondola, pressure washed the car, relined the car, and over-packed the flexible bulk containers  - All materials collected during decontamination procedures were drummed and transported to the designated disposal facility  The rail car was released to continue in transport to the designated facility in Robstown, TX on April 28, 2011.  There were no known or anticipated acute or chronic health risks associated with the release and no individuals were exposed.  US Ecology considers the release resolved and no further action necessary.  If you have any questions or need additional information regarding this incident, please contact me at 208-319-1614.

It was approximately 06:55 AM on 3 April 2011. He was traveling south on the Nine Mile Canyon road. The road is a narrow two lane dirt road. Weather conditions were dry with clear blue skies and some wind. Our employee was on a straight stretch of road going down a slight grade approaching a right hand turn in the road. Just prior to having to make the right hand turn in the road the driver laid the truck on its left side. He was going about 30 miles per hour and slowed to about 10 miles, per hour at the actual lay over. The pup remained upright. The tongue punctured the  rear compartment of the tank truck. As the tank truck struck the ground moving forward the left front header welded seam broke open causing a failure of the front compartment of the tank truck. (see pictures)    The failure of the two tank compartments led to the release of 4,000 gallons of #2 dyed diesel. It traveled down the left shoulder of the road consisting of road base gravel. It then continued onto sandy clay soil and was absorbed by the soil. See photos of the spill and ensuing clean up of the contaminted soil. The clean up was monitored by the BLM and the Duchesne, Uintah and Daggett Counties Tri-County Health Department.","The root cause of this accident was 100% driver error. No outside influence or condition contributed to this layover. There was no mechanical failure, speed was not an issue, and weather conditions were great.

No equipment failure occurred. The  drive/operator failed to measure the UST contents before beginning fill operations andconnected the hose to the wrong UST port with no safety valve. The proper fill port was used to insert fuel additives during this process. The UST filled before the tanker was emptied, forcing approximately 2,376 gallons of fuel onto the ground. Product flowed in two directions, impacting approximately 10,000 square feet of surface area before entering two storm water pipes and eventually discharging into the Williams Hollow Run stream. Authorities were contacted and responders deployed absorbent materials to minimize migration. Free phase product was also recovered via a vacuum truck. Since the incident, over 2,000 tons of impacted soil has been removed and disposed. Theinitial assessment report has been submitted to the WVDEP and groundwater investigation is planned to determine further activities.","In this case, human error caused the product release and no equipment failure was  determined.

Michael Culverson with Liberty Transport had an accident on 1-40 at the 312 mile marker in Oklahoma. Management was notified of the accident at 5:02 A.M. Management arrived on the scene and found that the truck had left the road way and came to rest on its top in the median. The trailer came to rest on the passenger side. The trailer was leaking out of the 1st compartment around the dome lid. Sooner Environmental was called to the scene by the Sequoyah County Emergency Management Officer to clean up the spill. The Oklahoma Department of Transportation brought in a load of sand to contain the spill and minimize environmental damage. Also the compartment #1 dome lid was secured until the trailer could be off loaded. After several attempts by a wrecker to set the truck back up a crane was dispatched to assist in the effort. While the truck and trailer was laying on its side Trooper Allen with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol conducted a Level II inspection(Report # OKOOC6061158) of the truck and trailer. No defects were discovered and the driver was cited for failure to devote full time and attention while driving(Citation # F177494). Environmental Claims Management was hired by our insurance company to oversee the cleanup efforts.,We have went from 4 safety meetings per year to 6 per year.

I immediately started from Eldon (Corporate Office) to the site which was approximately 70 miles away.    At 9:20am, I contacted the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Kansas City, IA at 1-800-424-8802 (National Hotline for Spill and Report) and was given a spill # of 972-030.    At 9:27am, I contacted the Iowa DNR and was given a spill # of 0400511-AHB-0933.  Upon reaching the site we found a 1,000 gallon NH3 tank tipped on its side with the valve guard completely knocked off the tank. Additionally, all three valves had been broken off by the roll. We picked up the tank with the tractor and loader and discovered it was 40% full yet by the frost line on the tank. The tank was originally 80% full and we lost approximately 40% (400 of the 800 gallons in a 1,000 gallon tank. The liquid NH3 did not run off the road, but the fumes did burn vegetation in the grader ditch. We watered down a portion of the road to determine the amount of NH3 in the gravel- the amount was not enough to cause any bubbling with H20 put on it. The liquid all evaporated before we got to the scene. The site of the spill was west of Highway 5 on UU Road, and was about a mile past the Junction of 614 and 141 Avenue. As I left the scene I received a call from Alan Corturient with the DNR of Missouri inquiring about the exact location of the spill due to the proximity of the highways and state line. We discovered that the spill was not in Missouri, but was in Franklin County, Iowa.","GOLDEN FURROW HAS CONDUCTED TRAINING ON TRANSPORTING ANHYDRONS AMMONIA, DISCUSSED THE SPECIFIC INCIDENT, AND REGULARLY REVIEWS SAFETY PROTOCOL WITH EMPLOYEES.

The two units ran approximately 675 ft along the roadway and finally came to rest on the shoulder of the road at approximately 3 :40am. Apparently there was a rupture in the LRCG tank which was carrying approximately 8,500 gallons of gasoline and the tank ignited. The LRCG tractor, LRCG tank, the majority of its contents of gasoline and the tandem car carrier trailer were totally destroyed by the fire during the ensuing blaze. Emergency response units arrived at the scene and doused the flames. As a result of the incident, a minimum amount of gasoline was spilled on the shoulder of the road and was subsequently removed and disposed-of by the environmental response unit assigned to the incident.","THE COMPANY HAS TAKWN ADDITIONAL STEPS TO ENDURE THAT OUR DRIVERS BECOME AWARE OF POTENTIAL HAZARDS AND PUT THEMSELVES IN A BETTER POSITION TO AVOID ACCIDENTS.
