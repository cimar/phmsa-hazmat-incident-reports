THE DRIVER'S INTENTION WAS TO PUMP THE OIL TO TANK 3 OF HIS TRUCK BUT THERE WAS A VALVE MALFUNCTION AND THE OIL WENT INTO TANK 1, OVERFILLING IT.  EXAMINATION OF THE VALVE AFTER THE INCIDENT AND CLEAN-UP INDICATED THE VALVE STEM HAD SHEARED LEAVING THE VALVE TO TANK ONE IN THE OPEN POSITION.  THE VALVE WAS REPLACED AND ALL OTHER VALVES INSPECTED WITH NO ADDITIONAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED.  APPROXIMATELY 20 GALLONS OF USED OIL DRAINED ONTO THE CEMENT OF THE CUSTOMER SITE WITH SOME OIL FLOWING ALONG THE CURBING INTO THE STREET.  THE DRIVER ESTIMATES THAT ONE GALLON OF PRODUCT GOT INTO A STORM DRAIN THE HAS ABOUT A 12 INCH SUMP THAT MUST FILL UP FIRST BEFORE THE DISCHARGE PIPE IS REACHED.  ALL USED OIL WAS CONTAINED IN THIS SUMP.  CLEAN-UP ACTIVITIES:  UPON REALIZATION OF THE PROBLEM, THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY STOPPED PUMPING OUT THE CUSTOMER TANK.  THE DRIVER THEN BEGAN CONTAINMENT AND CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS. STANDING USED OIL WAS PUMPED BACK INTO THE TRUCK.  ABSORBENT WAS SPREAD ON THE CONCRETE AND STREET TO ABSORB REMAINING RESIDUE.  THIS WAS SWEPT UP AND PLACED IN A DRUM.  THE AOC DRIVER'S SUPERVISOR REPORTED TO THE SCENE BRINGING ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES TO AID WITH THE CLEAN-UP.  HE AND THE DRIVER SPREAD ABSORBENT ON THE CONCRETE AND STREET TO ABSORB REMAINING RESIDUE. THIS WAS SWEPT UP AND PLACED IN A DRUM.  THEY REMOVED THE GRATE FROM THE STORM DRAIN AND PUMPED ALL LIQUID MATERIAL FROM THE DRAIN SUMP.  THEY WIPED DOWN THE DRAIN WALLS WITH ABSORBENTS TO REMOVE ANY OIL RESIDUE AFTER EMPTYING THE LIQUID MATERIAL.  THE DRAIN CONTAINED SLUDGE IN THE BOTTOM THAT HAD ABSORBED SOME OF THE OIL.  APPROXIMATELY 8 INCHES OF SLUDGE WAS DUG OUT OF THE DRAIN AND PLACED IN A DRUM.  AT THIS POINT IN THE CLEAN UP IT BEGAN TO RAIN.  AOC'S SUPERVISOR POURED ONE BAG OF ABSORBENT INTO THE DRAIN AND MIXED IT WITH THE REMAINING SLUDGE TO ABSORB ANY OIL SHEEN THAT MAY HAVE FLOWED INTO THE DRAIN SUMP WITH THE RAIN.  PER THE SUPERVISOR THIS WAS VERY EFFECTIVE.  AFTER THE RAIN STOPPED, THE ABSORBENT/SLUDGE MIXTURE WAS DUG OUT OF THE DRAIN.  THEY THEN POURED ABSORBENT ON THE STREET AND SWEPT IT UP TO REMOVE RESIDUE.  THIS PROCESS WAS REPEATED.  ALL USED ABSORBENT MATERIAL WAS RECOVERED AND PLACED IN A DRUM FOR SHIPMENT TO AOC'S SARALAND FACILITY FOR PETROLEUM RECLAMATION AND DISPOSAL.  AT THIS POINT, THE SITE WAS CLEANED BUT STAINED.  FIVE GALLONS OF MICROBIAL CLEANING AGENT WAS SPRAYED OVER THE SPILL AREA, THE AREA SCRUBBED AND RINSED OFF.  THIS REMOVED THE STAINING.  THE DROP IN LUBE OWNER, DONALD HEBERT, WAS ON-SITE AT THE TIME.

DURING THE INITIAL PROCESSING OF THE ORDER COORDINATOR INADVERTENTLY ASSIGNED ONE RAILCAR (GATX 5923) FOR THE TRANSFER, INSTEAD OF TWO RAILCARS (I.E..:SPLIT LOAD).  THE CONTENTS PREVIOUS CONTAINED INSIDE OF RAILCAR GATX 5923 WERE 179,820 LBS; MAXIMUM CAPACITY PROVIDING SUFFICIENT OUTAGE IS ROUGHLY 200,000 LBS.  COORDINATOR COMPLETED THE ORDER, SHE THEN ISSUED THE DRIVER THE INSPECTION LOADING FORM AND DIRECTIONS TO THE RAILCAR/LOADING AREA.  UPON THE TRACTOR-TRAILER'S ARRIVAL, THE DRIVER ISSUED TRANSLOAD OPERATORS THE INSPECTION LOADING FORM PROMPTING HIM TO UTILIZE RAILCAR GATX 5923.

IN ADDITION TRANSLOAD OPERATOR NEVER CONDUCTED A VISUAL CHECK OF THE PREVIOUS QUANTITY CONTAINED INSIDE RAILCAR GATX 5923; A NUT APPLIED TO ONE OF THE MANWAY BOLTS WAS EXTREMELY TIGHT PREVENTING THE MANWAY COVER FROM BEING LIFTED.

AT APPROXIMATELY 1:15 PM EST, THE PRODUCT WAS NOTICED SPRAYING OUT OF THE RAILCAR'S AIR INDUCTION PIPE ON GATX 5923.  THE DRIVER THEN IMMEDIATELY DEPRESSURIZED HIS TRUCK LIMITING THE FLOW OF PRODUCT.

IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE BUSHINGS FROM BEING HIT BY A FORKLIFT OR A PERSON WALKING PAST THE CONTAINER, THE TWO TRANSFORMERS WERE STRAPPED TO A PALLET WITH THE BUSHING POINTED TO THE MIDDLE.

The operator was trying to pick up a tote and inadvertantly had the end of the forks under the sulfuric acid tote which was behind the tote the operator was unloading. When the operator raised the load, the front of the second tote was lifted off the ground. The operator then backed up, causing the 2nd tote to fall from the forks. The force of the fall caused the front of the tote to crack spilling the entire contents of the tote. The spill came out of the back of the taller and into the storm drain at the loading dock. The spill was completely contained In the storm sewer. The spill response team was contacted and the free liquids were vacuumed up. The trailer and the storm sewer drain were then flushed and the wash water vacuumed up.
