HE INSTRUCTED US TO HAUL THE ONE TO HIS BUS GARAGE FIRST AS HE DID NOT WANT TO RUN OUT. OUR DRIVER WAS COMING THRU THEIR THAT MORNING SO I INSTRUCTED HIM TO DROP OFF A 1000 GALLONS IN ORDER SO THEY WOULD NOT RUN OUT. THE NEXT DAY AT 3:00 P.M. OCTOBER 24, 1995 WE CAME WITH THE BALANCE OF THEIR LOAD WHICH WAS 6000 GALLONS. OUR DRIVER UNLOADED HIS FIRST COMPARTMENT WHICH IS 2500. THEN HE PROCEEDED TO UNLOAD HIS SECOND COMPARTMENT. AFTER ABOUT 3 1/2 MINUTES THE FUEL CAME PUSHING OUT THE VENT PIPE SO HE IMMEDIATELY SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN. OUR DRIVER CALLED ME RIGHT AWAY AND TOLD ME WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I THEN CALLED AGASSIZ ENVIRONMENTAL AND TALKED TO JOHN LANDWEHR TO FIND OUT HOW QUICK THEY COULD GET THERE AND IF THEY HAD SOME EQUIPMENT WE COULD USE TO START THE CLEANUP. HE TOLD ME HE WOULD CONTACT THE PROPER PEOPLE AT THE PCA ABOUT THE RELEASE AND HE DID. I THEN WENT UP THE SIGHT MYSELF AND ACCESS THE SPILL. WHILE IN ROUTE I CALLED OUR DRIVER AND TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD DIKE ANY CALVERTS THAT IT COULD POSSIBLE FLOW THRU. HE THEN TOLD ME HE HAD TALKED TO THE OWNER WHICH WAS THE PERSON WHO ORDERED THE LOAD AND THAT THE OWNER SAID THAT HE MUST HAVE CALCULATED WRONG WHEN HE ORDERED THE LOAD. WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE SIGHT I SEEN THAT THE DRIVER HAD DIKED THE ONE CALVERT THAT IT COULD HAVE FLOWED THRU. AFTER INSPECTING THE SIGHT WE LAYED OUT CONTAINMENT BOOMS IN THE DITCH TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRODUCT WOULD NOT SPREAD, WE ALSO USED ABSORB PADS TO PICK UP SOME FREE PRODUCT THAT WAS ON THE GROUND. I THEN CALLED THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES, I TALKED TO JOHN TO MAKE SURE HE CALLED THE PCA, HE DID, I THEN CALLED THE NRC. WE CONTRACTED AGASSIZ ENVIRONMENTAL TO DO THE REST OF THE CLEAN UP AND FOR THE TRANSPORTATION AND THE DISPOSAL THE CONTAMINATED PRODUCTS. I THEN TALKED TO MR. SCHMITZ AND TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD STICK THE TANK BEFORE ORDERING A LOAD OF FUEL, HE THEN TOLD ME THE SAME THING HE TOLD OUR DRIVER THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE IN CALCULATING ALSO HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT STICK THE TANK BECAUSE OF ANGLES IN THE FILLING TUBE.
