LOCATED AT SCIENCE ROAD IN FAIRFIELD, CT. IN ORDER TO LOAD AND TRANSPORT A SHIPMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE FOR OFF-SITE DISPOSAL. UPON ARRIVAL AT KING INDUSTRIES, THE DRIVER OF THE VACUUM TRAILER INITIATED THE STEPS NECESSARY TO BEGIN LOADING HIS VEHICLE. ONE STEP IN THE PROCEDURE INVOLVES OPENING THE DRAIN VALVES ON THE VEHICLE'S SCRUBBER SYSTEM AND VACUUM PUMP ASSEMBLIES TO DRAIN ANY RESIDUAL MATERIAL THAT COULD HAVE COLLECTED IN THESE SYSTEMS FROM A PREVIOUS SHIPMENT. THE DRIVER PERFORMED THIS STEP AND CLOSED THE DRAIN VALVES AFTER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SYSTEMS CONTAINED NO RESIDUAL LIQUID. ONCE THE SETUP AND INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE WAS COMPLETE, THE DRIVER ENGAGED THE VACUUM PUMP IN ORDER TO INITIATE LOADING THE VEHICLE. IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT APPROXIMATELY 2 GALLONS OF MATERIAL ESCAPED FROM THE SCRUBBER SYSTEMS VENT STACK ONTO THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THE SURROUNDING PARKING AREA AND A SNOW BANK. IN ADDITION, AN EMPLOYEE OF KING INDUSTRIES AND HIS HOME DISPATCHER OF THE INCIDENT. FACILITY PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY ABSORBED ALL FREE LIQUIDS WITH SPEEDY DRI, COLLECTED THE CONTAMINATED SNOW AND DECONTAMINATED THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. ALL CLEAN-UP DEBRIS AND CONTAMINATED SNOW WAS CONTAINERIZED AND PLACED INTO STORAGE PENDING OFF-SITE DISPOSAL AT A FULLY LICENSED WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITY. A REVIEW OF THE INCIDENT INDICATED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO MATERIAL FROM THE PREVIOUS LOAD FREEZING IN THE PIPE WORK OF THE SCRUBBER AND VACUUM SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, IT IS BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE VACUUM UNIT WAS ENGAGED, THE PRESSURE CREATED BY THIS SYSTEM DISLODGED AN ICE PLUG WHICH, IN TURN, ALLOWED RESIDUAL LIQUID BEHIND THE ICE PLUG TO ESCAPE FROM THE VENT STACK. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE FORMATION OF THE ICE PLUG PREVENTED THE DRIVER FROM DISCOVERING THE RESIDUAL LIQUID IN THE SCRUBBER UNIT WHEN HE OPENED THE DRAIN VALVES PRIOR TO INITIATING THE LOADING PROCEDURES. IN ORDER TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF THIS EVENT, DRIVERS AND LOADING PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN RE-INSTRUCTED TO INSURE THAT ALL SCRUBBER UNITS ARE DRAINED COMPLETELY PRIOR TO SUBSEQUENT DISPATCH.",,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,450,,US,
