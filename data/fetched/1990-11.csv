INITIAL REPORTS BY LOCAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES INDICATED THAT MINR LEAKGE HAD OCCURRED DURING THE OVERTURN AND THAT NO LEAKAGE WAS EXPERIENCED OR CONTIUING AFTER THE UNIT CAME TO REST.  A CONTAINEMENT DIKE WAS CREATED WITH A BACKHOE AT THE EAST END OF THE VEHICLE AND THE WEST END WAS CONSIDERED  CONTIANED BY THE NATURAL CONTOUR OF THE GROUND.  LOCAL ANS STATE AUTHORITIES ESTABLISHED A ONE-HALF MILE EVACUATION PERIMATER AROUND THE ACCIDENT SITE, BASED ON INFORMATION CONTIANED IN THE D.O.T.'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE GUIDEBOOK, SHORT TIME AFTER THE ACIDENT OCCURRED.

APPROXIMATELY 3,000 GALLONS OF THIS MATERAIL WAS RECOVERD BU PUMP TO ANOTHER CARGO TANK FOR RETURNE TO THE SHIPPER FOR REPROCESSING.  THE OVERTURNED VEHICLE WAS THEN UPRIGHTED AND REMOVED FROMT HE AREA.  CONTAMINATED SOILS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY RECOVERED AND REMOVED AND THE TOP SOIL WAS REPLACED.  THE AREA WAS RESTORED TO ITS NATURAL CONDITION THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT. REPROCESSING OF THE RECOVERD LIQUID MATERIAL WAS DETERMINED BY THE SHIPPER NOT IT BE POSSIBLE.
