DRIVER LOOKED BEHIND HIM, SAW NO PRODUCT ON THE GROUND/STREET OR ELSEWHERE.  HOWEVER THE AIR BLEED-OFF VALVE WAS PARTIALLY OPEN.  THE DRIVER COMPLETED CLOSURE OF THE AIR VALVE, COMPLETED DELIVERY.  THE CONSIGNEE REPORTED THE SHIPPER ON APRIL 13 THAT PRODUCT WAS FOUND BY THE CONSIGNEE ON 4/1 ON THE GROUND WITHIN THE CONSIGNEE PLANT ON THE STREET BETWEEN THE WEIGHT SCALE AND THE LAB WHERE THE AIR VALVE WAS CLOSED.  THIS AMOUNT WAS ESTIMATED BY THE CONSIGNEE TO BE TWENTY GALLONS.

THE DIFFERENCE WAS 60 POUNDS, FUEL WAS ONE GALLON @ 7# PER GALLON, LADING WEIGHT 13# PER GALLON FOR A DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT FOUR GALLONS COULD BE LOST ON THE STREET FROM SHIPPER TO CONSIGNEE.  AN INSPECTION OF THE ROUTE DID NOT REVEAL ANY EVIDENCE OF SUCH LOSS, BUT TIME ELAPSED WOULD BE A FACTOR.

THE MATERIAL SPILLED FROM A 275 GALLON INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINER (IBC) THAT FELL OFF A IN-PLANT CART WHILE BEING TRANSPORTED FROM THE CONTAINER FILLING AREA TO THE MAIN WAREHOUSE.  THE TOP OF THE IBC SPLIT OPEN SPILLING ESSENTIALLY THE ENTIRE CONTENTS ONTO CONCRETE, AN ADJACENT GRASSY AREA, AND INTO A PLANT DITCH. THE SPILL AREA WAS IMMEDIATELY SECURED AND TRAINED HARCROS RESPONDERS STARTED SPREADING SODA ASH AND LIME ON THE SPILL SITE LESS THAN ONE HOUR AFTER THE INCIDENT BEGAN. BECAUSE OF IMMINENT RAINFALL, WE SPREAD AN EXCESS OF ALKALINE MATERIAL ON THE SPILL AND ALONG THE DITCH DRAINING THE AREA.  BEFORE WE COULD PROPERLY MIX IN AND NEUTRALIZE ALL THE ACID, HEAVY RAINFALL BEGAN.  PH SAMPLES OF WATER IN THE PLANT DITCH SYSTEM AND ALONG SPEAKER ROAD SHOWED NO ACIDIC MATERIAL IN THE WATER. ABOUT 3-1/2 INCHES ON RAIN FELL THAT AFTERNOON. THERE WAS MORE RAIN ON FRIDAY, 4/23 AND OVER THE WEEKEND SO REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES DID NOT CONTINUE UNTIL MONDAY, 4/26.  WE REMOVED MOST OF THE EXCESS ALKALINE MATERIAL FROM THE DITCH AND STARTED MIXING THE MORE CONTAMINATED SOIL.  AS OF LATE THIS AFTERNOON, THE PH OF MOST AREAS, INCLUDING THE SOIL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DITCH, WAS NEUTRAL OR SLIGHTLY ALKALINE.  ONE HOT SPOT STILL HAD A PH OF 2 TO 3.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MIX AND ADD NEUTRALIZING MATERIAL UNTIL WE GET THE PH OF ALL AREAS CLOSER TO NEURAL.  OTHER THAN SOME DEAD GRASS IN THE  IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE SPILL, THERE IS NO APPARENT ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE THE CAUSE OF THE IBC FALLING WAS PROBABLY DUE TO A BAD WHEEL ON THE CART. THE BAD WHEEL CAUSED VIBRATIONS WHICH PROBABLY SLOWLY SHIFTED THE IBC TO ONE SIDE UNTIL IT FELL OVER LANDING ON ITS TOP EDGE.  TO HELP PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN, WE ARE INCREASING OUR PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ON THESE  CARTS.

THE SOURCE OF THE ODORS WAS FROM THE  ABOVE CONTAINER THAT WAS PACKED CURB SIDE ADJACENT TO THE CUSTOM'S DOCK. THIS CONTAINER HAD BEEN INSPECTED THE PREVIOUS DAY  ACCOUNT REPORTED OF ODORS, AND PHYSICAL SIGNS OF LEAKING PRODUCT WERE OBSERVED AT THAT TIME. AN EXTERIOR INSPECTION OF THE CONTAINER WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT NOTED NO PHYSICAL SIGN OF LEAKING PRODUCT. SINCE THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF LEAKAGE, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AGREED TO REOPENING THE INTERMODAL FACILITY, AND MOVING THE ISOLATION AREA TO WITHIN 100 FEET OF THE CONTAINERS LOCATION. AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF PHONE CALLS TO VARIOUS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE VESSEL CARRIER, FRIEGHT FORWARDERS, WAREHOUSES, AND FREIGHT BROJKERS, CONTACT WAS MADE  WITH THE MANUFACTURER. MR LARRY HUFFINE, PHILLIPS CHEMICAL, PROVIDED THE PRODUCT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. ONCE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ASSURED THROUGH MONITORING, THAT THERE WERE NO FLAMEABLE VAPORS BEING EMITTED FROM THE CONTAIBNER, THEY DEPARTED THE SITE. LOS ANGELES COUNTY HEALTH HAZ MAT WANTED THE SOURCE OF THE ODORS IDENTIFIED, WHICH REQUIRED THE CONTENTS OF THE CONTAINER TO BE REMOVED AND INSPECTED. THE LADING CONSISTED OF 36 METAL 55 GALLON DRUMS, ALL OF WHICH WERE FLOOR STACKED. THEM BLOCKING AND BRACING USED TO SECURE THE DRUMS CONSISTED OF 2 EACH 4X4'S THAT WERE WEDEGED INTO THE CORRUGATED SIDE WALLS OF THE CONTAINER, 2 FEET FROM THE REAR DOORS. THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDED SECUREMENT PROTOCOL, NOR IS IT AN APPROVED METHOD PER AAR PAMPHLET 6C FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS VIA THE RAILROAD. ONE DRUM WAS SITUATED IN THE LAST ROW AGAINST SIDE WAL, AND HAD A HAND NOTED ON THE PRODUCT LABEL,  ""LEAKED 5 GALLONS"". WHITE THE BUNG WAS IN PLACE, THE PROTECTIVE DUST CAP WAS MISSING. CLOSER INSPECTION SHOWED THIS DRUM TO BE SECURE. ALL OF THE DRUMS WERE REMOVED, INSPECTED, AND TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION. DURING THE REMOVAL PROCESS, NO DRUMS WERE FOUND TO BE LEAKING. SEVERAL ITEAMS OF INTEREST WERE NOTED WHILE REMOVING THE DRUMS.NUMEROUS DRUMS HAD GREASY FOOT  PRINTS ON THE TOP AREA, INDICATING SOMEONE HAD WALKED OVER THIS LOAD. ALL OF THE DRUMS HAD RESIDUE STAINS OVER THE TOPS OF THE DRUMS, WHICH INDICATED THE DRUMS HAD POSSIBLY BEEN EXPOSED TO THE WEATHER.
