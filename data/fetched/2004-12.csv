SINCE THIS DELIVERY WAS A GROUND DROP, HE PLACED THE TWO CARTONS ON THE ICC BUMPER OF THE TRAILER.  WHEN THE DELIVERY WAS COMPLETE, HE FORGOT ABOUT THE TWO CARTONS AND NEVER PUT THEM BACK INTO HIS TRAILER.  HE THEN PULLED OUT OF THIS DELIVERY AND CONTINUED ON HIS ROUTE.  WHEN HE ARRIVED AT HIS NEXT DELIVERY, A FEW BLOCKS AWAY, HE REMEMBERED ABOUT THE CARTONS.  HE THEN BACKTRACKED HIS ROUTE TO LOCATE THEM.  UPON ARRIVING BACK AT THE PRIOR DELIVERY, THEY HAD ONE CARTON WHICH THEY FOUND SITTING IN THEIR YARD.  THE 2ND CARTONS WAS NOT LOCATED.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE SECOND BOX WAS FOUND ON THE STREET BY A PASSER BY.  IT IS TAKEN TO SALEM FIRE DEPARTMENT.  DEPUTY MONROE PULLED THE PACKING LIST AND CONTACTED THE SHIPPER 3M, WHO THEN CALLED US.  DEPUTY MONROE ADVISED THAT THE CARTON SHOWED SIGNS OF BEING HIT, BUT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE LEAKING.  WE THEN HAD THE DRIVER GO TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO PICK UP THE CARTON AND TAKE IT TO THE HOSPITAL.  WHEN THE DRIVER ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL, THEY CHECKED THE CARTON WITH A METER AND REFUSE IT AS POSSIBLY LEAKING.  WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A LEAKING CARTON, WE HAD TRIED TO CONTACT A CLEAN UP COMPANY BUT WERE UNABLE TO SECURE ONE.  SINCE THE HOSPITAL RECEIVING WAS CLOSING AT THIS TIME WE SEND AN OVERPACK TO THE HOSPITAL AND HAD THE CARTON PLACED INSIDE.  THE OVERPACK WAS THEN RETURNED TO OUR TERMINAL AND HELD UNTIL A HAZ-MAT COMPANY COULD BE GOT TO INSPECT THE CARTON.  HMHTTC WAS CALLED FOR THIS.  UPON THERE INSPECT AND MIGRATION THEY FOUND THAT 1 OF 12 CYLINDERS HAD LEAKED AND WAS EMPTY.  THE CONTENTS WERE REPACKED FOR SHIPPING BY HMHTTC AND RETURN TO THE SHIPPER.","WHILE THE INCIDENT WAS BEING INVESTIGATED, THE DRIVER UNDERSTOOD HIS ERROR AND THE POSSIBLE HARM THAT COULD HAVE COME TO IT.

COUNTY LINE ROAD, WHILE BLACKTOP-PAVED, IS A RELATIVELY NARROW HIGHWAY THAT HAS LITTLE TO NO OFF-PAVEMENT SHOULDERS. THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL OF THE BOBTAIL DROPPED OFF THE EDGE OF THE PAVEMENT. THE MINIMAL SHOULDER THAT WAS AVAILABLE WAS SOFT.  THE DRIVER WAS UNABLE TO OVERCOME THE COMBINATION OF MOMENTUM AND THE SOFT, NARROW SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY.  THE TRUCK WAS IMMEDIATELY DRAWN OFF THE HIGHWAY AND INTO THE ADJACENT ROADWAY DITCH.  THE TRUCK DID NOT ROLL OVER BUT DID SETTLE ONTO ITS SIDE.  THERE IS APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 15 GALLONS OF LIQUID PROPANE THAT REMAINS IN THE PIPING THAT EXTENDS FROM THE BOTTOM, MIDDLE OF THE DELIVERY TANK TO THE PUMP AND DISCHARGE VALVE ASSEMBLY OF THE DELIVERY VEHICLE.  THE JARRING EFFECT OF THE TRUCK AS IT ENTERED THE DITCH AND SETTLED OVER ON ITS SIDE BEFORE COMING TO REST IN THE DITCH ALLOWED THE LIQUID PROPANE TO ESCAPE FROM THE TRANSFER PIPING AND VALVE ASSEMBLY.  THE INTERNAL EMERGENCY VALVE IN THE DELIVERY TANK'S INTERIOR PREVENTED ANY PRODUCT FROM ESCAPING THE DELIVERY TANK.  THE LIQUID PROPANE THAT WAS RELEASED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED TO THE VAPOR FORM AND QUICKLY DISSIPATED INTO THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY SHUT OFF HIS TRUCK ENGINE AND ESCAPED FROM THE CABIN OF THE DELIVERY TRUCK.  HE CONTACTED HIS SUPERVISOR TO INFORM HIM OF HIS DILEMMA.  NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCIES IN THE AREA.  THE WARREN COUNTY, IOWA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT (CASE #44982), WARREN COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, AND THE NORWALK, IOWA FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED INITIALLY TO THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT.  UPON ARRIVAL OR WHILE ENROUTE TO THE SCENE, THE NORWALK, IOWA FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF REQUESTED ASSISTANCE FROM THE DES MOINES AREA REGIONAL HAZMAT UNIT. BECAUSE THE INCIDENT INVOLVED PROPANE, THE AREA WAS IMMEDIATELY SECURED AND AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL'S WITHIN 1/4-MILE RADIUS OF THE ACCIDENT WERE EVACUATED AND MOVED A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE. A SMALL SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE) OF COUNTY LINE ROAD WAS SEALED OFF BY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND/OR FIRE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS PREVENTING ENTRY INTO THE ACCIDENT SITE BY UNAUTHORIZED INDIVIDUALS.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DELIVERY VEHICLE COULD BE SAFELY EXTRACTED FROM THE ROADWAY DITCH.  A WRECKER SERVICE WAS CONTACTED AND DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE.  THE TRUCK WAS REMOVED FROM THE DITCH IN A PROCESS WHICH CONSUMED APPROXIMATELY 2 - 1/2 TO 3 HOURS.  UPON REMOVAL FROM THE ACCIDENT SITE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO DIESEL FUEL HAD ESCAPED FROM THE FUEL TANK OF THE DELIVERY VEHICLE WHILE IT RESTED ON ITS SIDE IN THE DITCH.  HOWEVER, IT APPEARS THAT APPROXIMATELY 1 PINT OF USED MOTOR OIL ESCAPED FROM THE CRANKCASE OF THE TRUCK THROUGH THE OIL FILL SPOUT AND CAP COVERING THE FILL SPOUT.

OUR DRIVER WAS TURNING LEFT ON A GREEN ARROW AND PROCEEDING WEST ON THE NORTH SERVICE ROAD OF I-10.  A PICK-UP TRUCK STRUCK OUR TRANSPORT TRAILER ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TRAILER UNDERNEATH THE BELLY OF THE TRAILER.  THERE WAS AN EQUIPMENT FAILURE THAT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.  THE SAN ANTONIO FIRE DEPARTMENT AND SAN ANTONIO POLICE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO THE ACCIDENT.  THE TRANSPORT TRAILER WAS ON FIRE AND WAS RELEASING LIQUID PROPANE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TRAILER FROM AN EXPOSED INTERNAL VALVE.  THERE WAS PROPER PROTECTION IN PLACE TO GUARD FROM A SIDE IMPACT ACCIDENT.  AT THIS TIME, THE ACCIDENT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE.  THE FIRE THAT RESULTED FROM THE BURNED UNCONTROLLED FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO AND ONE-HALF HOURS.  THIS WAS A LIQUID FED FIRE AND THE TRANSPORT DID SWELL FROM THE INTENSE HEAT BUT DID NOT RUPTURE OR BLEVE.  AFTER THE FIRE CONSUMED ALL THE PRODUCT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT MOVED INTO THE FIRE LOCATION AND COOLED DOWN THE REMAINING REMANTS OF METAL.  ALL COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS FROM BOTH VEHICLES WERE ENTIRELY CONSUMED.  DURING THE INCIDENT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD MADE THE DECISION TO ALLOW THE FIRE TO BURN ITSELF OUT WITHOUT ANY EXTINGUISHMENT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED A ONE SQUARE MILE AREA AT THE DECISION OF THE HAZMAT PERSONNEL ON SCENE.  AMERIGAS SAFETY TEAM LEAD MARK HOLLOWAY WAS NOTIFIED AT 22:00 HOURS AND RESPONDED TO THE SCENE IN SAN ANTONIO.  AN ATTEMPT TO LOCATE THE DRIVER, HAVE THE DRIVER POST-ACCIDENT TESTED, AND SECURE THE SCENE WAS THE OBJECTIVE.  THE DRIVER WAS LOCATED WITHOUT INJURIES AND A LOCAL AMERIGAS REPRESENTATIVE ASSISTED WITH TAKING THE DRIVER TO A NEAR-BY HOSPITAL.  THE HOSPITAL REFUSED TO TEST STATING THAT THE DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS NECESSARY AND THAT NO OTHER LOCAL FACILITY COULD AT THAT LATE HOUR.  THE DECISION WAS MADE TO HAVE THE DRIVER TEST THE NEXT MORNING AT HIS HOME IN SEQUIN, TX.  TEAM LEAD MARK HOLLOWAY SECURED THE EQUIPMENT AND TOOK PICTURES OF THE ACCIDENT SCENE.
