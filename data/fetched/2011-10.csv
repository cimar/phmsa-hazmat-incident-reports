Pressure was reduced and leak stopped. According to eye witnesses, between 5 and 10 gallons of liquid HCL coalesced and ran out of the rain drains from the spill dam onto pavement in the loading area. Cause of valve failure: Packing nuts and washers on the underside ot four of the six stainless steel 3/8' bolts holding the valve together in compression failed over time due to corrosion from the HCL. The nuts and washers were found n the spill dam during maintenance after the incident. Because of their orientation and proximity to the top of the tank, visual inspection is impossible without mirrors. Mitigation of future events: 1.) Replace bolts quarterly, and 2.) Utilize mirrors and lamps to inspect underside of all stainless bolts on closures and valves.","Tank trailers in HCL service will be inspected in-house quarterly.

The tank car was located in Track T-20 in the Terminal Railway Interchange Yard. Trainmaster John Milton took the necessary protective measures by establishing a safe perimeter and advising all Terminal personnel, including Manager Rules & Safety Paul Ashcraft, of the situation while Yardmaster Jason Jones contacted Chemtrec to address the leak and the accumulated product on the track. Trainmaster Milton also contacted Rayonier who was the shipper of this car for the MSDS sheet for the product. After reviewing the MSDS, Manager Rules & Safety Paul Ashcraft reapplied the cap on the steam valve outlet to stop the leak at approximately 0600.    Manager Rules & Safety Paul Ashcraft contacted ARC Terminals account the car had been released by ARC and pulled by Terminal Railway at approximately 2000 on October 10th to advise that the tank car was leaking and requested assistance in securing the car. Also, Mr. Ashcraft contacted Manager of Environmental Management for the Alabama State Port Authority for his assistance.    Rayonier who was the original shipper contacted United States Environmental Services to arrange for the remedial clean up of the contaminated area. It was estimated by  United States Environmental Services that approximately 30 to 40 gallons of product was released. It was determined that a cross threaded cap allowed the product to leak from this tank car.     United States Environmental Services completed the removal of all contaminated soil and ballast at approximately 1930 on October 11, 2011.

While transferring one container, it was discovered that approximately 1 ounce of material escaped from the bottom of the container. Facility personnel placed the leaking container into a suitable salvage drum along with all clean-up debris from the van trailer. The container was secured and was sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility. All required local and state reports were made that included verbal reports to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection and local Fire Department.","At the time the driver accepted the container for transportation, no evidence of leaking was observed. The driver, however, was re-instructed to conduct a  thorough inspection of each container before acceptance and if any evidence of a reduction in structural integrity is found to take appropriate action to either place the container into a suitable salvage drum or re containerize before transportation is initiated.

He connected a 2"" chemical hose to the valve of the IBC that was to be transferred to the unloading pump. (2) 2"" chemical hoses were then connected to the outlet of the unloading pump to the customer tank. The employee then secured all connections with Velcro straps. The customer informed the driver the unloading process was approved which he then engaged the air to the offloading pump and opened the IBC valve. The employee inspected all connections for any leaks. He noticed the product had developed a leak at the valve and hose connection. The driver then closed the valves to the IBC and pump to stop the transfer process. He then proceeded to clean up the spilled material; all recovered material was containerized for subsequent disposal. The driver inspected the chemical hose and found the gasket to be compressed. A new gasket was inserted into the hose connection and the transfer process resumed. Once the driver had returned to the shipping facility the gasket was inspected and confirmed his findings of being compressed.","To prevent future incidents all employees who perform bulk unloading processes were instructed to change hose gaskets every 2 weeks. This was a monthly task prior to this incident. Drivers will again be instructed to inspect all hose gaskets prior to any bulk unloading and replace if the visual inspection of the gasket shows signs of damage or any compromises.

No ground impact from spillage was reported. The FRA inspector reported one manway securement bolt adjacent to the manway cover hinge was not tool tight (hand tight only). Also, the vapor valve's closure plug was found not tool tight (hand tight only), with no reported leak from this orifice. CHVX 287226 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard awaiting securement correction and spill remediation from a response contractor.  On 10/13/2011, inspection of CHVX 287226 by contract responders revealed that the two manway securement bolts positioned on either side of the manway cover hinge were not tool tight. The manway gasket was inspected and found serviceable. The manway cover was then closed and properly secured. A small dried product stain emanating at the vacuum relief valve's (VRV) threaded connection atop the manway cover near the hinge area was also observed. The VRV was removed and thread sealant applied to all threads. The VRV was reinserted and tool tightened. The vapor valve's closure plug that was not tool tight was removed. Thread sealant was applied to the plug's threaded connection; plug reinserted and tool tightened. Product stains on the tank shell were wiped and cleaned.   Intact manway cover seal CPC 215739 was replaced by seal TIS 5829.  Intact valve housing cover seal CPC 215741 was replaced by seal TIS 5827.  Response was concluded by 1100 hrs. MDT, 10/13/2011.

He put his four way flashers on, and proceeded towards the shoulder of I-10 to get off of the intestate highway.  He was halfway off the shoulder and coming to a complete stop when a tractor trailer hit him in the rear of the tanker trailer he was pulling. The tractor hit him with such force that it lifted the loaded trailer off of the ground, punctured the rear of the tank, and caused the spillage of the entire cargo from the tanker.  Safeway Transportation's trailer, and MC 407, was carrying 45,200 pounds of formaldehyde, solution, class 8; UN 2209: PG III, RQ.  The collisions resulted in a puncture to the rear of the trailer.  The force was so great that it ripped the fifth wheel off of the Safeway truck.  A small amount of Sodium Hydroxide solution was spilled by the van that hit the Safeway trailer.  The Sodium Hydroxide was being carried in a van trailer in totes, by Transport America, the owner of the other tractor trailer.    Emergency vehicles were dispatched from the local area.  A small fire truck arrived on the scene and assisted with the injured, and made themselves available to provided water support, if needed.  State Police arrived on the scene.   The leak was significant, and could not be stopped according to personnel at the scene.  Personnel were kept away from the trailer because of the product's  hazardous   nature.       A passenger in the Transport America truck was injured, and was trapped in her   seat. It took approx two hours to eventually free her and get her on a flight to the nearest hospital in Phoenix, Arizona.  Her injuries were not fatal.    The State Police and a hazmat team from the state of Arizona took command of the site, contacted Safeway Transportation, Inc., and maintained contact as needed throughout the evening, on into the next day. The State Police established a posture that would protect personnel and property in the area, and minimize exposure the environment.   This included the movement of sand to the contaminated area to avoid the odor as well as any run off.  The Haz Mat Officer and the Contractor coordinated this aspect of the operation.  All personnel working on the damaged trailer and product, donned their protective masks, and the area was cordoned off. Local and state police redirected traffic along the I-10 corridor, and shut down the flow of traffic as needed.   The police used cross over areas to facilitate the flow of traffic where they could.  The traffic shut down was said to be approximately 12 hours.  It was suggested by the Haz. Mat. Officer when he arrived on the scene that due  to the location of the incident and the time required to get a hazmat team out to this rural area in Arizona a contract hazmat team selected by","SINCE THE RELEASE WAS DUE TO A VEHICLE ACCIDENT THAT WAS THE RESULT OF SAFEWAY'S VEHICLE BEING STRUCK FROM BEHIND WE CANNOT THINK OF ANYTHING THAT THE SAFEWAY ORGANIZATION COULD HAVE DONE TO AVOID THIS ACCIDENT.

All packages surrounding the shipment were checked for contamination and moved away from the effected area.  The area was secured and spill containment material was laid on the area to surround pallet where the leak had been found.  Continental Airlines' Environmental Affairs department was called to clean the spill and dispose of the materials.      When the package was opened, it was found to be intact (on the inside and out); however, the paint on the inner drum was ""bubbling"" and material as leaking from the bottom seam of the drum.   There was no cushioning or absorbent material inside the package.  All 5 liters had been released.    It is unclear as to how long the package had been leaking, but was in an area that  would have been noticed if it had been leaking for a long period of time.    The second spill of the 2pc shipment was found at approximately 0630 on 10/26/2011 during a routine inventory check.  This piece had been removed from the pallet from the first spill to avoid contamination.  It had been checked and was not leaking on 10/24/2011.    Continental's Environmental Affairs department was called as well as local FAA Inspector Bob Craig.  Upon opening the second package, it was also determined that it had not been damaged, but was leaking from the bottom seam.

Apparently, the employee hooked up the safety chains and failed to put in a hitch pin.  On the way back to town, there was a downhill slope and the trailers started to sway back and forth.  Before the employee could get the pickup and trailers stopped, the safety chains broke and the two NH3 nurse tanks rolled into the ditch.  As a result of the tanks rolling, the rear tank twisted and broke off the hitch to the first tank and when it rolled the roll cage for the valves was broken away from the tank and the front liquid withdrawal valve was snapped off at the tank.  The excess-flow part of the valve remained in the tank and was only letting vapor escape from the tank. While efforts to put the nurse tanks in an upright position, there was a small amount of liquid that was stirred up and released into the air.  There was approximately 3-4% in the 1000 gallon nurse tank which equates to approximately 127#--176#.  There was no amount of Anhydrous released from the first tank.","Ag Partners has retrained those employees that are involved with delivery and return of Anhydrous Ammonia Nurse tanks for farmer customers. This training consisted of discussion on the incident, only drivers with proper licensing & endorsements are to pull nurse tanks, procedures for hooking up nurse tanks to pickups, utilizing secondary gravel roads as much as possible to avoid traffic, speed while on the roads, stopping at all railroad crossings, lighting requirements, and paperwork required in pickups.",No,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Ag Partners, LLC",US,

I immediately called Aurelio to make sure he was not injured. He stated he had already called 911 and he was not injured.    Driver stated he was making a left turn onto Imperial from Atlantic and tried to beat the light and took the turn too fast. The movement of the product caused the rear trailer to overturn. The trailer impacted a power poll forcing open the dome lid.    I then call John Miller and got him rolling to the accident, contacted Mo from Patriot and he was already in route. Brian had contacted him. I also notified Dave Palmer and had he started heading down. Around 0145 I called Aurelio again to see who had arrived and he stated LA Fire and the Sheriff Department was on scene. LA Fire was working on containing the product.    Around 0200 LA Fire Chief Ray called me to ask who our Hazmat Response Company was and the ETA. I told him Patriot Environmental and they should arrive in the next 15 to 30 min. Patriot arrived and the initial report of the spill was reported.    Around 0230 Miller arrived with a pump truck and reported the pull trailer was turned on its side and product was leaking out the dome lid. Our estimate was that 1500 gallons was released based on the remaining product that was pumped off. His plan was to pump off the trailer and have the towing service upright the unit. This was completed successfully and the truck and trailer was removed and taken to the Southgate yard around 0420.    Patriot started working on the clean up process. Dave arrived at 0510 and started communicating with the first responders. His report will contain all the contact information and any paperwork received. Final clean up was completed around 1500 and declared clear at this time.    A company safety meeting was held, details of the accident were discussed. Root causes was identified and discussed.

This was a four compartment trailer and the first compartment had been completed.  The second compartment was to receive 2000 gallons. Loader made all necessary connections and then set the pump pre-set meter for 2000 gallons. He started the transfer and periodically observed the meter for gallons pumped.  He first observed 1000 gallons had been transferred then looked back, and noticed the meter was stuck on 1600 gallons.  As he reached to shut down the transfer, he noticed compartment # 2 had overfilled.  Approximately 5 gallons of ethanol was retained in the drip pan and an additional 5 gallons overflowed the drip pan and contacted the ground. No drains or water was affected.    AWARENESS ITEMS:  1. The scully switch cover was closed and locked and keys were controlled by management.  Always ensure the pump is not in bypass mode prior to locking the cover.    2. Pump had a history of mechanical failure with its last repair being to the volume meter on 9/20/11.  This was the second transfer after the repair.    3. The scully is a protective system put in place to ensure trailers are not overloaded.  When operated in bypass mode, we work without any backup protective system.   4. Scully lights were tested and were proper working order: green-good ground; red- no ground; no lights if in bypass.   5. Floater employee was familiar with ethanol operation.","ROOT CAUSES:  1. Equipment failure.  It was determined by an outside mechanic that the meter box was not functioning properly.   RBT made the recommendation to have the preset meter, temperature compensator and volume meter replaced.   2. The pump was being operated while in bypass mode.      CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:    1. Pump was immediately locked out and taken out of service.   2. The inspection of all scully switches will be made part of the monthly inspection to ensure they are not in bypass mode.   This is to be documented on the inspection sheet.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,TRANSFLO / Kinder Morgan,US,

While maneuvering through an ""S"" curve, the driver drove the tractor too far into the left shoulder where it was very  muddy. The driver attempted to bring the tractor back onto solid ground and did so too abrubtly.  This inappropriate reaction caused the weight of the loaded trailer to carry the tractor-trailer over on its left side.  The tractor-trailer came to rest on the left side shoulder of the road.  The driver exited the cab and notified his Supervisor.  Kansas Highway Patrol responded to the scene as well as company personnel. No product was spilled.  Due to muddy conditions and darkness, the KS Highway patrol made the decision to secure the scene and postponed uprighting the truck until morning.  The following morning, the product was transferred to another transport.  The wrecked transport was then uprighted and towed away by wrecker service.  No further action was required, and no clean up was necessary.",The root cause of this lay-over accident was due to the driver's mistake in driving too far onto the muddy shoulder of the road and subsequently reacting to the situation inappropriately.  The vehicle's estimated speed just before the lay-over was 25 mph.  The driver could have avoided the shoulder all together as there was enough room to navigate the transport around the curve safely.  The driver could have also responded differently once he realized he was too deep into the shoulder.  He could have easily continued forward and come to rest instead of aggressively attempting to bring the tractor back onto solid ground.  Additional awareness training on the factors that caused this accident is warranted.  All company drivers will participate in an accident review process to include discussion on what went wrong and how to avoid the situation in the future.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,21500,"BKEP Crude, LLC",US,

B&P Enterprise personnel reported that cargo was placed on top of the tote, which caused it to bend and ultimately resulted in a hole in the tote. B&P Enterprise personnel reported that approximately 5 gallons of material released onto the trailer floor and also impacted a small area of the asphalt parking lot. B&P Enterprise personnel initially plugged the leaking tote until a transfer could be made. B&P Enterprise personnel utilized absorbents to collect the released material from the impacted trailer floor and asphalt parking lot. B&P Enterprise personnel transferred the material from the damaged tote into a replacement tote.

Car isolated and shipper notified.      Shipper representatives, SWS Environmental, responded and found a 10 inch long by 1 inch wide crack at the base of the manway nozzle flange due to the collapse of the tank shell.  Preliminary investigation developed that the material was loaded at an elevated temperature and the car is non-insulated and is not equipped with a vacuum relief valve to allow for cooling and contracting of the contents en route.  It is suspected the negative pressure inside the tank shell caused the shell to implode during transportation releasing a small amount of material from the 10 inch crack.      The crack was located at the highest point on the car after the defect developed.  The remaining product was transferred into six trucks and returned to shipper's origin facility for further handling.  Scale weights of the inbound trucks indicated little to know actual product loss.    The car will be cleaned and scrapped on site.

Driver failed to negotiate curve for unknown reason, lost control, and rolled truck and semi trailer.  Pup trailer remained up. Driver was fatally injured when truck came in contact with jersey barrier.  UHP commented to me unofficially speed into the off ramp was the major contributing cause.  No other parties involved and no witnesses.  Inspection report found one brake out of adjustment, but nothing else.  Truck was loaded with butane coming from Opal, WY and unloading at the Big West refinery in North Salt Lake.  No release of product from either trailer.    We called Mountain States Propane to offload the butane.  Lincoln Environmental was called by the local fire department for possible hazmat cleanup and remediation.  A representative from Weber County Health Department was there to monitor Lincoln’s cleanup efforts.       UDOT provided barricades for road closures from approximately 11:30 until 5:30.  Associated Towing removed the trailers from the scene.  All butane was taken to the refinery and off-loaded.  Notification was made to the National Response Center; report number is 993702.","This driver had recently gone through our rollover prevention training along with many others in our safety training program.  There was no reason that police or our investigation could find as to why he entered the offramp with excessive speed and unable to make the curve.  No breach of product occurred even with the overturn.    Only possible cause we could determine was some sort of driver distraction or medical condition.  We were not notified of any health concerns on the autopsy, nor was UHP able to determine any sort of driver distraction.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,140000,PILOT TRAVEL CENTERS LLC,US,

BINDER,SAFETY SPECIALIST,7201 Hamilton Boulevard,Allentown,PA,18195,Carrier,Our truck was involved in an accident with another vehicle. The point of impact was at the rear axles at the back of the trailer. This impact was strong enough to open the bottom fill valve on the trailer ¼ turn. The valve would ordinarily not open very easily. The liquid nitrogen leaked from this valve for two hours which emptied the entire load. Liquid nitrogen boils and vaporizes at normal temperatures so the entire load returned to the atmosphere. The valve could have possibly been closed but the first responders did not want to approach the trailer.,We had a discussion with the first responders on the scene about how to deal with a nitrogen release and the precautions to take. We are discouraging our drivers from using mountainous two lane roads when there is a safer alternative route. The route where the accident occurred has many curves and steep grades.  The trailer is a very sturdy design as is the valve that came open. The driver could have forgotten to tighten the valve enough but we have no way of knowing. Training for the drivers will stress checking trailer valves at each stop to make sure they are tight.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,97000,"Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.",US,

The crate was inadvertently loaded with other crates, which did not contain hazmat. It is not known who loaded the crate but it was likely a NYCT subcontractor.

The material was being transported by Murphy Courier Service Inc.  When ENRAD shipping and receiving personnel opened the doors of the closed vehicle they observed that the two wooden packages inside were damaged.  One had a 4-5 inch opening in the bottom where the floor of the box had separated from the upper walls of the box.  The other had a loose 2X4 board attached to the outside but was not breached.  ENRAD personnel immediately secured the area around the transport vehicle and began surveys of the packages and vehicle to determine if any radioactive contamination had been released.  Surveys results identified that no radioactive contamination had been released.  ENRAD personnel then determined and executed a process for removing the packages without causing further damage to the packages or release of radioactive contamination.  The packages were then properly stored according to ENRAD radiation protection procedures.  A gross contamination survey, using a treated cloth, along with a direct surface radiation readings survey were performed on the cargo area.  There was no contamination detected in the cargo area of the vehicle so the driver and the vehicle were released.  A Duke Energy Nuclear Generation Problem Investigation Program (PIP) event was written for the incident (G-11-1599).  The Oconee Radiation Protection Manager, Oconee Radiation Protection Shipping Supervisor, General Office Radioactive Shipping Support person, and General Office Radiation Protection Supervision were notified at approximately 18:49.    The reporting requirements of 49CFR171.15 were discussed with the General Office Radioactive Shipping Support person that evening.  In particular, the meaning of ""breakage"" as specified in 49CFR173.15(b)(3) was discussed.  It was decided to gather more information concerning the incident and confirm the meaning of ""breakage"" the next morning prior to contacting the DOT.  The morning of Oct. 28 the DOT Hotline was contacted concerning whether ""breakage"" meant breakage of the package.  The DOT Hotline promptly referred the General Office Radioactive Shipping Support person to PHMSA Interpretation #08-0213, December 18, 2008 which specified that notification of the DOT is required when the package is broken, regardless of whether the inner container is intact.  The DOT Response Center was contacted at 13:50. Courtesy calls were also made to the North Carolina radiation protection licensing area, US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and to American Nuclear Insurers.    Problem with Package Construction:    Inspection was performed on the packages to determine the quality of the construction.  Both packages were constructed of wood with clean square cuts that","Oconee Nuclear Station, McGuire Nuclear Station, and Catawba Nuclear Stations radioactive shipping areas were provide pictures of the damaged packages, information on the incident, and a warning about using wooden packages on 10/31/11.      System wide interim actions were implemented  11/2/2011 that required permission from the Radiation Protection Manager at each station's approval prior to using packaging made of wood.     The following are excerpts of changes that have been approved for inclusion in the standard shipping procedures for Oconee, McGuire, and Catawba Nuclear Stations.     IF during transport of radioactive material in commerce, as defined in 49CFR171.1, a DOT incident as noted in 49CFR171.15 or 49CFR171.16 occurs (e.g.; person injured or killed, traffic disrupted, fire, breakage of package even with no release of radioactive material, suspected contamination release, undeclared DOT hazardous material discovered); ensure the incident reporting requirements of 49CFR171.15, 49CFR171.16, 10CFR71.5, and ANI are satisfied by referring to References 2.16, 2.28, and 2.29     IF feasible, avoid use of packages constructed from wood when shipping heavy items.       Suggestions for packages constructed from wood:   - Items inside boxes shall be cradled or supported in a manner that avoids  concentration of weight on small areas of the floor of the box (e.g.; cradle or   reinforcing of specific areas of the floor to distribute weight).  Points and narrow edges shall be padded or prevented from coming in contact with the shell of the   package.     - Consideration shall be given to ensuring the weight of the material will not     damage the box shell when being lifted by forklifts/fork trucks.  Ensure cradles    and/or flooring are constructed in a manner that result in minimum flex in     flooring when supported by feet or forklift.    - Avoid construction that allows lifting of package using upper structures of box    (e.g.; rim attached to walls of box).  (It is difficult to attach the floor of a    wooden box to the upper structure in a manner that will prevent separation when lifting using the upper structure.)     -  Junction of walls, floor, and lid shall be inspected to ensure adequate nails or screws have been used to join the applicable components. Keep in mind that nails or screws driven between layers of laminated wood (ends) has less holding strength than nails or screws driven through the multiple layers.     IF using a packaging constructed from wood, Radiation Protection Manager approval required.",No,BOX WOOD,Wooden box,BOX WOOD,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Duke Energy,US,

The driver hit a concrete barrier separating the interstate roadways and flipped over.  The driver was killed upon impact with the concrete barrier and signage.  The overturned tank began to leak asphalt oil.  The Topeka police called and notified me of the accident around 5:30 a.m. and asked what the content was in the trailer.  I immediately drove to the scene to assist with calling HazMat Response and answer any questions by emergency personnel.  The Fire Department contained the oil that was spilling by making a berm made of sand and dirt until the HazMat crew was allowed to begin cleanup. Cleanup occurred after the accident investigation team was complete which took at least five hours.  The oil was spilling from a rupture/crack that occurred during the roll-over near the rear discharge.  The Hazmat Response team was able to successfuly clean up all of the oil that was spilled.  A second tanker was called in to remove as much of the remaining oil as possible from the tank.",I am still unclear as to why the driver hit the concrete barrier.  We have not received an official accident report or medical/coroner report as of yet.

The Maury County EM Response Team was called but would not put water on the fire due to the fact the trailer started leaking and a stream was near the area. The heat from the tire fire melted the gasket on the unload valves and started the leak. The trailer was allowed to burn out and the leak was contained in the shoulder area.

This information is being provided for the purpose of documenting the activity, and to aid in the processing of the claim. DEC has expressed their satisfaction with our response, on more than one occasion during the cleanup.    Fuel release occurred on October 19th around 12:30pm we had the spill contained and all standing fuel, saw dust and absorbent pads/booms picked up and hauled out to OIT (Organic Incineration Technology) all before 7pm.    Day of the spill October 19th:  • Freezing rain and snow the evening before created exceptionally icy roads with ice and snow, as reported in the local paper.  • Driver had 4,300 gallons on the truck and took a corner too fast on Easy Street, and after sliding, the back tires hit the curb making the truck tip over on its side. The rear bulkhead separated,spilling fuel.  • An unidentified person came upon the scene and called 911, turned off the truck, and checked on our driver  • Fairbanks Fire,Police,DEC and rescue units showed up on the scene  • Fairbanks Police called Ben's Towing to see if they could upright the truck to stop the fuel  • Bob Wilson (GM for Aerofuel) was notified/Bob notified myself as he and our shop manager Randy Wilson left for the scene  • I responded to the scene and arrived the same time as Bob Wilson/Our insurance company was notified  • Randy called Alaska Rubber for the purchase of absorbent material.

THE DRIVER EXITED THE TRUCK AND NOTICED LIQUID DRIPPING FROM THE FRONT PORTION OF THE TRAILER.     ACTIONS TAKEN:  THE DRIVER CALLED THE CARRIER (SMITH SYSTEMS TRANSPORTATION) AND REPORTED THE RELEASE.  THE DRIVER HAD ACCESS TO A BAG OF CLAY ABSORBENTS AND WAS ABLE TO PLACE THE ABSORBENTS ON THE RELEASED MATERIAL ON THE ASPHALT PARKING AREA TO PREVENT FURTEHR MIGRATION OF THE MATERIAL.  THE CARRIER CALLED ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, INC., AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPANY FOR THE CARRIER, AND ENVIRONMENTAL   MANAGEMENT DISPATCHED A LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL COMPANY TO PERFORM THE CLEANUP ACTIVITIES.  THE TRAILER FLOOR WAS LOADED APPROXIMATELY 60% FULL WITH A SINGLE LAYER OF 55-GALLON DRUMS.  THE CLEANUP CREW ARRIVED ON-SITE AND UNLOADED THE TRAILER USING A MINI-EXCAVATOR AND A DRUM SLING.  THE CREW LOCATED THE LEAKING DRUM NEAR THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER AND INVERTED THE DRUM TO STOP THE LEAK.  A CRACK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DRUM, APPROXIMATELY 1 INCH LONG, WAS THE REASON FOR THE LEAKAGE.  THE CREW PLACED THE FAILED DRUM INTO AN 85-GALLON SALVAGE DRUM.  THE CREW THEN USED CLAY ABSORBENTS TO REMOVE THE RELEASED MATERIAL FROM THE TRAILER FLOOR AND FROM THE DRIVEWAY UNDER THE TRAILER.  THE CONTAMINATED ABSORBENTS WERE COLLECTED AND PLACED INTO AN 11-GALLON WASTE DRUM AND LABELED FOR DISPOSAL.  THE TRAILER WAS RELOADED, INCLUDING THE 85-GALLON SALVAGE DRUM AND THE 11-GALLON WASTE DRUM AND THE LOAD WAS SECURED.  THE TRUCK WAS THEN RELEASED TO CONTINUE TO THE DESTINATION.  THE WASTE FROM THE CLEANUP ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN SENT FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.
