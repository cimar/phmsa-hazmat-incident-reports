Univar management dispatched an emergency response contractor to scene and also traveled to the scene to manage the response.  Approximately two gallons of material leaked from the drum over an appromimately 10 minute period.  Emergency response contractor arrived, cleaned material from floor of truck, and cleaned customers pavement using degreaser, absorbent material, and pressure washing.  All cleanup materials were contained and removed to seperate waste drums. A small hole was found in the bottom of the container, similiar in size to the nails used in pallet construction.    The cause of the leak was determined to be a puncture by one of the nails used to construct the pallet.

The cylinders released propane due to the heat from the fire.  There were 540 cylinders aboard the trailer. The gallons released are approximate.

Responders reported one IBC found with a broken outer steel frame structure that had pierced and cut the top center sidewall of the plastic inner receptacle of this IBC. This remaining commodity (Concentrated Alkaline Liquid Cleaner) within this damaged IBC was transferred to another suitable IBC and properly labeled.   During the lading removal from TGHU 969851 for cleaning, two additional IBC's with a different corrosive hazardous material were noted leaking due to cuts in their inner plastic receptacles. These two IBC's were also transferred to other suitable IBC's. All other lading within TGHU 969851 was inspected and when necessary, cleaned of any spillage. Afterwards, all lading was placed into another intermodal container and secured for furtherance in highway transportation. TGHU 969851 was removed from the intermodal facility and taken to the responder's facility for additional floor cleaning.

He asked the operator there if the load would fit into the tank and the operator said that it would.  As the trailer was getting to the end of unloading, the customer’s tank overflowed.  The driver shut down the unloading.  The release was into containment and the operator said that it was not a big deal.    When the driver got to the facility he looked at the tank reading to see if the tank would hold the full amount. The tank read 1420.  The tank capacity is 6000 gallons and the trailer had 4650 gallons.  The driver told the operator that there wasn’t enough room but the operator said that they were pulling product out of the tank while we were loading so that it would fit.  The driver took precautions and stood close to the end of the trailer so that he could shut the valve off quickly if necessary.  Just as the hose started jumping (which signals the trailer is going empty) the product started coming out of the tank.  The driver couldn’t see the release because it was coming out of the back of the tank top, but he could hear it, so he shut it off.  There was about 10-15 gallons of hypochlorite spilled in containment.  The driver asked the operator what he wanted him to do, and the operator said not to worry about it, that it was all in containment.  Another operator commented that when they draw out of the tank that it doesn’t come out very fast which is why it overflowed.",The driver saw that there wasn’t enough room and made a poor judgment in deciding to allow the operator to convince him that it would fit.

No cars or trucks flagged him down.  He did not leave a trail going into the consignee.  It may have been a slow leak that stuck to the trailer.  Product was thick.  The unload was completed.  Since the washout cap was secured properly, the product on the trailer was sticky and was not in any danger of running off, and the customer did not have room in their yard, the trailer was taken to a nearby truckstop to be cleaned off.

The driver placed a bucket under the drip to contain the drips of product. Less than 1 gallon of nitric acid was released to the parking lot of the truck stop before the leak was detected. The duration of the leak is unknown. The incident was reported to the Louisiana State Police (case # 13-02733) and USES was called out for emergency response clean up and to transfer the product from the leaking trailer into another Martin Transport trailer. The leaking trailer was taken for testing and inspection to determine the location and cause of the leak where it was discovered that the trailer was leaking at the ring at the front of the dome box and where the clean out nipple is welded in the tank.","Lap repairs will not be utilized on any DOT trailer.    Internal inspections and leak tests will be performed on all trailers in corrosive service at least annually.

The secured manway cover was opened to check commodity outage levels and it was observed that the level of outage was insufficient. Contract responders used a vacuum truck to reduce the lading within UTLX 208445 by approximately 2600 gallons without further incident which also ended the liquid release from the PRD. Afterwards, the shipper arranged to transfer the commodity from the vacuum truck to tank truck for furtherance.

Univar dispatched both Emergency Response contractor and Univar management to the scene.  Once response teams arrived at the scene, it was determined this small leak was caused by a cross treaded cap on one of the IBCs.  The amount of liquid lost was less than one gallon.  The liquid was cleaned from the under carriage of the trailer, and absorbed on the trailer floor.  No material reached the ground.  The lid was properly installed on the container.  Once the issue was corrected, and the spillage cleaned, the driver continued to his destination.","As the spillage was caused by a cross threaded cap on a IBC, recommendation would center around a better process to ensure the proper closure of similiar containers.

MY TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, SCHOFF FARM SERVICE INC, DELIVERED A TRANSPORT LOAD OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA TO CONSEV FS IN ROCKFORD, ILLINOIS. IN PREPARATION TO UNLOAD, MY DRIVER STRUCK A LOW 10 FOOT UNMARKED OVERHEAD ANHYDROUS PIPE WHILE TRYING TO MANEUVER TO UNLOAD HIS TRANSPORT.  WHEN THE LIQUID LINE WAS STRUCK A 2 INCH LINE WAS CRACKED AND ANHYDROUS AMMONIA BEGAN TO RELEASE. THE QUICK RELEASE VALVE (IF PRESENT) DID NOT CLOSE.  THE DRIVER WENT TO THE STORAGE TANKS AND CLOSED ALL VALVES AND A 2 INCH LIQUID VALVE FEEDING THE LOAD RACK FAILED THERE AS WELL.  IF THE 3 INCH BELLY VALVE WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTALLED DIRECTLY AT THE BELLY OF THE STORAGE TANK IT WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE FLOW, HOWEVER; IT IS 12 TO 18 INCHES UNDER THE TANK WITH 2 INCH PLUMBING PIPED IN BETWEEN THE TANK BODY AND THE MAIN VALVE. (I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS ANYWHERE.)  CONSERV HAD THREE MAJOR VALVE FAILURES IN MY OPINION:  1) QUICK RELEASE AT POINT OF IMPACT LOADING RACK  2) 2 INCH LIQUID VALVE AT STORAGE TANKS  3) THE 3 INCH BELLY VALVE WAS NOT PROPERLY INSTALLED ON THE STORAGE TANK.  I AM COMPLETING THIS FORM IN GOOD FAITH BECAUSE THE COOP, GROWMARK INC., AND CONSERV FS FEEL IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE MY TRANSPORT MADE THE INITIAL CONTACT.  IN MY OPINION, CONSERV NEEDS TO COMPLY WITH THIS DOT 5800 FORM AS WELL SINCE THEIR COMPANY OWNED PRODUCT WAS RELEASED FROM THEIR STORAGE TANKS.  NO PRODUCT WAS RELEASED FROM MY TRANSPORT.  IF THE COOP WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLIANT IN SAFETY, CRASH CONTROL, AND MAINTENANCE THE INCIDENT WOULD BE NO MORE THAN A WAGON PULLING AWAY FROM AN APPLICATOR OR LOADING STATION.  A QUICK PUFF OF SMOKE AND WAITING A MINUTE FOR THE AIR TO CLEAR.  THAT HAPPENS OFTEN WHEN SAFETY VALVES WORK PROPERLY.  IN ESSENCE, THAT WOULD BE A NON-REPORTABLE INCIDENT DUE TO THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF PRODUCT RELEASED.    IN NO WAY DOES SCHOFF FARM SERVICE, INC. ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DAMAGES OTHER THAN THE PIPE THAT WAS BENT ON THE CUSTOMER'S PROPERTY.","I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND ALL THE VOLUNTEERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS FOR THEIR EFFORTS; HOWEVER, THEY ALL NEED SPECIFIC TRAINING UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE 100,000 GALLONS OF WATER DUMPED ON THIS LEAK CAUSED MORE DAMAGE THAN GOOD. THE COOP NEEDS TO CONSIDER WHERE THEIR RUNOFF GOES. THEY ALSO NEED TO PUT ALL LINES UNDERGROUND, NEVER OVERHEAD, AND IF SO PROTECT THEM WITH STRUCTURES SUCH AS CONCRETE OR GUARD RAILS! LOW OVERHEAD LINES NEED TO BE MARKED WITH SIGNS.  AS A CARRIER AND DRIVER FOR OVER 30 YEARS, I FEEL I HAVE A LOT TO OFFER THIS INDUSTRY WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY AND HANDS ON COMMON SENSE. I AM HAPPY TO BE MORE COMPLETE OR PROVIDE DETAILS IF NEEDED.

This caused the tractor and trailer to overturn on its left side and come to a rest on the off ramp. No other vehicles or persons were involved in this incident. Driver was not seriously injured. Because of the impact and overturn, methanol was slowly leaking out of the 3 inch wash out cap on top of trailer. Methanol was contained by Fire Hazmat Team and they and a company contracted private hazmat response team contained the methanol and transferred the remaining methanol to a safe container, cleaned up the spilled methanol from roadway and towing company removed the damaged tractor and trailer. Due to the nature of methanol, most of the released methanol evaporated shortly after the release.","Revisions were made to company's Driver Safety Manual, to better reflect how drivers are to safely conduct themselves and report any future incidents. The driver that was involved in the incident was terminated. A detailed and lengthy safety meeting is scheduled this month, in which the company officials will go over this incident in great detail and discuss future improvements in safety procedures and safe driving.

The operation is a city water facility which is equipped with automatic electronic monitored valves and horn alarms on plumbing and valves. The driver/unload-er had just completed a walk around inspection and was preparing to shut pumps, valves to disconnect when the off loading hose he was next to twisted indicating back pressure. The driver unloading immediately closed supply. The off loading transfer hose split exactly where the the driver unload-er was standing, spraying the front of driver unload-er face and chest. Even with his personal protective equipment the spray caused soaking. The city employee immediately put the driver unload-er under the emergency shower and driver unload-er was taken to the hospital to evaluated by a doctor of skin, eyes and lungs.  The driver/unload-er was released the same day of event. During the event no alarms were activated by city monitors. The volume was less than two gallons, under RQ with no spill clean-up necessary. What spray discharged from the hose occurred from three to five seconds, which evaporated. The new hose that ruptured was placed in service previously on 04-24-2013.",A hooded spash proof tyvex suit and fully hooded Powered air purifying respirator (PAPR)is now used with air supply from canister cartridges fastened to the backside of the driver/unload-er in lieu of a standard full face-shield cartridge respirator. A auxiliary bypass was installed on the unloading plumbing in case the primary malfunctions.

THATCHER'S DRIVER AND THE PLANT OPERATOR DECIDED TO UNLOAD THE PUP TRAILER OF T-CHLOR FIRST, AND THE OPERATOR TOOK THE DRIVER TO UNIT 4 WHERE HE UNLOADED THE TRAILER OF T-CHLOR. PRIOR TO UNLOADING THE T-CHLOR AT UNIT 4, THE DRIVER SHOWED THE OPERATOR THE BILL OF LADING FOR THE T-CHLOR, AND THEN HOOKED THE HOSE UP.    WHEN THE T-CHLOR TRANSFER WAS COMPLETE, THE DRIVER ASKED THE OPERATOR WHERE THE LEAD TRAILER WENT, THINKING THAT SECURITY HAD ALREADY INFORMED HIM THAT THE LEAD TRAILER CONTAINED FERRIC SULFATE. THE ONLY INFORMATION THE OPERATOR HAD RECEIVED, HOWEVER, WAS FROM THE CONTROL ROOM THAT HE HAD A CHEMICAL DELIVERY AND HE THOUGHT THAT BOTH TRAILERS WERE T-CHLOR. THE PLANT OPERATOR WAS NOT SHOWN THE BILL OF LADING FOR THE FERRIC SULFATE. THE OPERATOR TOOK THE DRIVER TO UNIT 1, A T-CHLOR TANK, AND THE DRIVER STARTED UNLOADING THE FERRIC SULFATE INTO IT. THE DRIVER HAD NOT DELIVERED CHEMICALS TO THE PLANT BEFORE AND WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE LOCATIONS WHERE EACH CHEMICAL NEEDS TO BE UNLOADED. AFTER APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES, THE CO-MINGLING OF T-CHLOR AND FERRIC SULFATE STARTED TO EMIT A GASEOUS VAPOR THAT AFFECTED BOTH THE DRIVER AND THE OPERATOR.
