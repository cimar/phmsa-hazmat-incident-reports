The fire department took care of the spill and placed all of the product in an overpack drum on the back of the trailer. They also placed absorb dry on the floor of the trailer and requested that we let it air out for two to three hours before the driver continues, which the driver did. The driver delivered to the consignee the next day and the load was refused due to the absorb dry that was on the floor.

THE PAINT WOULD NOT ADHERE TO THE RUST, AND AS A RESULT MUCH OF THE PAINT HAD FLAKED OFF EN ROUTE. ONE OF THE DRUMS HAD RUSTED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE DRUM, RESULTING IN THE TOTAL RELEASE OF THE 55 GALLONS OF PRODUCT. ADDITIONALLY, 10 OTHER DRUMS WERE SEEPING PRODUCT FROM AROUND THE BUNGS. CLOSER EXAMINATION REVEALED A LACK OF GASKETS ON THE BUNG CAPS. AT THIS POINT, THE SPILL ESTIMATE WAS REVISED TO 60 GALLONS.

AS THE CONTAINER WAS PLACARDED TOXIC, THE AREA WAS SECURED TO PREVENT THROUGH TRAFFIC AND ISOLATED, PENDING INSPECTION.  MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE ICTF AND NOTED A SMALL POOL (LESS THAN 1 PINT) OF LIQUID ON THE PAVEMENT BELOW THE RIGHT FRONT NOSE OF THE 20 FOOT CONTAINER.  A SLIGHT ODOR OF TDI WAS PREVALENT IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE SPILL.  THE CORNER OF THE CONTAINER WAS DIAPERED TO PREVENT ANY ADDITIONAL RELEASE OF THE PRODUCT, AND THEN MOVED TO THE CUSTOM'S DOCK, WHERE IT COULD BE INSPECTED.  THE PAVEMENT IN THE STALL AREA WAS COVERED WITH ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND ISOLATED PENDING REMEDIATION.  UPON OPENING THE REAR DOORS OF THE CONTAINER, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE LADING OF DOUBLE STACKED METAL DRUMS WAS SECURED WITH TY-GARD FABRIC MATERIALS.  THE DRUMS WERE SEPARATED ON THE BILEVEL WITH 1/2 INCH PLYWOOD.  THE TY-GARD APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN PROPERLY APPLIED EXCEPT FOR THE SIDEWALL APPLICATION WHERE THE FABRIC WAS ONLY ATTACHED TO THE RAISED PORTIONS IN THE CORRUGATED SIDEWALLS, AND DID NOT FOLLOW THE OUTWARD PORTIONS OF THE CORRUGATION.  WHILE THE TY-GARD APPEARED TO HAVE ""STRETCHED"" SOME, THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY NOTICEABLE DAMAGE TO THE DRUMS FROM MOVING WHILE IN TRANSIT.  INFORMATION FROM THE DRUM LABELS PROVIDED A CONTACT WITH THE MANUFACTURER, WHO FAXED THE MSDS FOR THE PRODUCT.  AS THE LEAK APPEARED TO BE FROM THE NOSE OF THE CONTAINER, THE ENTIRE LADING HAD TO BE REMOVED TO LOCATE THE SOURCE.  UPON REACHING THE NOSE ROW OF DRUMS, THE DRUM ON THE TOP LAYER, IN THE RIGHT FRONT CORNER OF THE CONTAINER, WAS FOUND TO BE LEAKING.  CLOSER INSPECTION OF THE DRUM DEVELOPED THE BOTTOM CHIME HAD THREE SMALL FLAT SPOTS WITHIN AN AREA OF APPROXIMATELY 2 INCHES. THE CENTER FLAT SPOT ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CHIME HAD A HAIR LINE CRACK THAT ALLOWED THE PRODUCT TO SEEP OUT.  IT APPEARS THIS CHIME DAMAGE WAS DONE PRIOR TO LOADING AS THERE WERE NO PROTRUSIONS IN THE PLYWOOD SEPARATOR THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE.  THE DRUM WAS PATCHED AND PLACED INTO A RECOVERY DRUM FOR SECUREMENT. BASED UPON THE WEIGHT OF OF THE DRUM, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT LESS THAN 1-2 GALLONS OF PRODUCT ESCAPED.  THE CONTAINER WAS DECONNED AND THE REMAINING DRUMS WERE PLACED BACK IN THE ORIGINAL SHIPPING CONTAINER.  THE DAMAGED DRUM WAS HELD OUT PENDING RETURN SHIPPING INFORMATION FROM THE MANUFACTURER.  THE LADING WAS SECURED AND THE CONTAINER RELEASED FOR MOVEMENT ONTO THE CONSIGNEE.  THE PARKING STALL WAS ALSO REMEDIATED AND THE AREA OPENED FOR USE.

A SMALL AREA OF THE PAVEMENT SHOWED SIGNS OF LEAKING FROM THE REAR DOORS, AND APPEARED TO BE LESS THAN ONE PINT OF MATERIAL, WHICH HAD DRIED. AS THE CONTAINER WAS PLACARDED TOXIC, THE AREA WAS SECURED TO PREVENT THROUGH TRAFFIC AND ISOLATED UNTIL IT COULD BE INSPECTED.

INFORMATION FROM THE DRUM LABELS PROVIDED SHIPPER CONTACT AND ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  UPON REMOVING THE TWO ROWS OF DRUMS AT THE REAR OF THE CONTAINER, THE FLOOR LOADED DRUM IN THE SECOND ROW AGAINST THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CONTAINER APPEARED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  THE FLOOR LOADED DRUMS HAD BEEN PLACED ON SHEETS OF PLYWOOD THAT COVERED THE FLOOR.  WITH THIS EXTRA ELEVATION, THE BOTTOM CHIME OF THE DRUM HAD ABRADED THE ROUGH WELD IN THE CORRUGATED SIDEWALL WHERE THE ""D"" RING IS ATTACHED TO THE FLOOR OF THE CONTAINER.  THIS DEPRESSION IN THE SIDEWALL ALLOWS THE DRUM TO SIT WITH THE CHIME SLIGHTLY INDENTED INTO THE SIDEWALL, ALLOWING FOR CONTACT WITH THE ""D"" RING.  THE BOTTOM PORTION OF THE CHIME ABRADED THE ROUGH WELD WHICH CAUSED THE INSIDE OF THE CHIME TO DEVELOP A CRACK, ALLOWING THE PRODUCT TO SEEP.
