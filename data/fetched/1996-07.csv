THE RELEASE OCCURRED AS REFINERY OPERATIONS STAFF, A LOADER BLENDER ""A"" (LBA), PREPARED TO UNLOAD THE RAILROAD TANK CAR. THE RELEASE WAS CAUSED BY THE FAILURE THE VALVE HOUSING OF THE RAILROAD CAR'S TOP UNLOADING VALVE, A THREE-INCH JAMESBURY VALVE, DURING THE INITIAL STEPS OF THE MTBE UNLOADING PROCESS. A SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION ATTRIBUTED THE FAILURE OF THE VALVE TO MISSING PACKING ASSEMBLY HOLD-DOWN NUTS, AS SHOWN BY THE ATTACHED BILL OF LADING, ARCO CHEMICAL COMPANY LEASED RAILROAD TANK CAR NATX 29120 TO DELIVER MTBE TO THE BAKERSFIELD REFINERY. PRIOR TO UNLOADING THE RAILCAR, THE LBA COMPLETED THE BAKERSFIELD PLANT'S ""TANK CAR INSPECTION CHECKLIST"" AND THE ""GENERAL INSPECTION ON ARRIVAL CHECKLIST"". THE LBA UNSEALED THE DOME LID ON THE RAILCAR AS PART OF THE ""GENERAL INSPECTION UPON ARRIVAL"" PROCEDURE. HE ATTACHED THE VAPOR PRESSURING/DEPRESSURING HOSE TO THE RAILCAR. HE COMPLETED DEPRESSURING THE VAPOR SPACE TO THE AREA 1 FLARE. THE LBA THEN ATTACHED THE TWO-INCH DIAMETER UNLOADING HOSE TO THE RAILROAD TANK CAR. HE DID THIS BY UNSCREWING THE THREE-INCH MALE NATIONAL PIPE THREAD (MNPT) PLUG FROM THE TOP OF THE THREE-INCH JAMESBURY BALL VALVE. HE HAD ALREADY CONNECTED THE OTHER END TO THE SWEDGE REDUCER TO A DRY BREAK CONNECTION FOR THE TWO-INCH HOSE. THE LBA THEN PRESSURIZED THE RAILROAD TANK CAR TO 40 TO 60 PSIG WITH MAKE-UP GAS FROM THE NATURAL GAS HEADER. THE LBA COMPLETED ALL HOSE CONNECTIONS TO THE RAILROAD TANK CAR AND BEGAN OPENING THE UNLOADING VALVES. THE FIRST VALVE OPENED BY THE LBA  WAS THE THREE-INCH JAMESBURY VALVE ON THE RAILROAD TANK CAR. AS THE LBA OPENED THIS VALVE, THE PACKING BLEW OUT. HE WAS NOT INJURED. THE PRESSURE IN THE RAILROAD TANK CAR PUSHED MTBE UP THE DRAIN PIPE AND OUT THE BODY OF THE JAMESBURY VALVE. THE LBA EVACUATED THE AREA AND SOUNDED THE ALARM. BAKERSFIELD PLANT STAFF INITIATED AN INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM AND A BAKERSFIELD PLANT RESPONSE TEAM. KERN COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS, AND A KERN COUNTY HAZMAT RESPONSE TEAM RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT. WATER AND FOAM WERE APPLIED TO THE RAILROAD TANK CAR AND THE SURROUNDING AREA TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE. ALL NEARBY PLANT OPERATIONS AND ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT WERE ALSO SHUT DOWN TO FURTHER REDUCE THE RISK OF FIRE. NO FIRE RESULTED FROM THE INCIDENT. ONCE ALL PRESSURE INSIDE THE RAILROAD TANK CAR WAS RELIEVED, THE HAZMAT TEAM SEALED THE LEAKING VALVE. FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT, BAKERSFIELD PLANT STAFF DISCUSSED THE NEED FOR AN IMPROVED RAILROAD TANK CAR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM WITH ARCO CHEMICAL STAFF. BAKERSFIELD PLANT STAFF AND ARCO CHEMICAL STAFF HAVE HELD PERIODIC MEETINGS TO DISCUSS ARCO'S RAILROAD TANK CAR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM AND OTHER CUSTOMER SERVICE ISSUES.
