THE CONTAINER WAS LEAKING AT THE RATE OF ONE DRIP EVERY THREE MINUTES, WITH A SIX INCH PUDDLE ON THE ASPHALT PAD UNDER THE CONTAINER. DEAN COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED. HE MET STEVE WITTMAN, CONTRACTOR FOR INDUSTRIAL WASTE UTILIZATION, TO REMEDIATE THE LEAKING CONTAINER FOR THE SHIPPER, SUNKIST. RMCC MADE NECESSARY NOTIFICATIONS TO CHEMTREC, CES, AND A COURTESY NOTIFICATION TO LOS ANGELES CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT. INSPECTION OF THE CONTENTS NOTED THE ENTIRE LADING OF 55 GALLON METAL DRUMS, FLOOR LOADED WITH A VOID OF SEVERAL FEET AT THE REAR DOORS. THE VOID AREA HAD SEVERAL USED PALLETS PLACED ON THE FLOOR TO PREVENT THE DRUMS FROM SHIFTING. APPROXIMATELY 16 DRUMS AT THE REAR OF THE LOAD HAD SHIFTED TO THE REAR, IMPACTING THE PALLETS, CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO THE LOWER THIRD OF THE SIDEWALLS. TWO DRUMS WERE FOUND LEAKING FROM THE BOTTOM CHIMES WERE THE SIDEWALL OF THE DRUM WAS SO DEFLECTED INWARD THAT THE METAL WAS PULLING APART AT THE CHIME. ESTIMATED 2-3 GALLONS WAS LOST FROM EACH DRUM. THE DRUMS WERE INVERTED AND PLACED INTO SALVAGE DRUMS FOR SECUREMENT. WHILE INSPECTING THE REMAINING DRUMS, AN ADDITIONAL 12 DRUMS WERE FOUND TO BE SO SEVERELY DAMAGED THAT THEY WERE DEEMED UNFIT FOR ANY FURTHER TRANSIT. VIRTUALLY EVERY DRUM IN THE LOAD HAD SOME FORM OF DAMAGE, AND THE SEVERELY DAMAGED 12 DRUMS REQUIRED OVER PACKING IN SALVAGE DRUMS FOR SECUREMENT PRIOR TO ANY ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTATION. THE ENTIRE LOAD OF DRUMS AND OVER PACKED DRUMS WERE PLACED INTO A HIGHWAY TRAILER FOR OVER THE ROAD TRANSPORT BACK TO THE SHIPPER, SUNKIST GROWER. DEVELOPED INFORMATION THAT THIS CONTAINER ORIGINATED FROM THE SUNKIST FACILITY, ONTARIO, CA, AND MOVED BY RAIL ON 12-24-02 FROM LONG BEACH, CA, TO BARBOURS CUT, TEXAS, WHERE THE CONTENTS WERE FOUND TO BE DAMAGED UPON ARRIVAL.
