AT ABOUT 0220 THE ACID TRUCK WENT OFF THE ROAD AT THE CURVE IN FRONT OF THE PENN RUN FIRE CO.  THE TRUCK WENT OVER SOME TREE STUMPS AND LANDED WITH THE BACK OF THE TRUCK TAKING OUT A CORNER OF A HORSE STALL.  THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED.  WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE POLICE REPORT YET.  THE DRIVERS IN FRONT OF THE ACID TRUCK REPORTED SEEING A WHITE VAN GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND ESTIMATED THAT THE VAN WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE CURVE THE SAME TIME AS THE ACID TRUCK.  BUT THE DRIVERS AFTER HIM DIDN'T SEE A WHITE VAN.  THE DOT OFFICER INSPECTED THE TRUCK FOR PROBLEMS AND NO PROBLEMS WERE NOTED.  THE TRUCK PASS THE INSPECTION.  AT THE TIME THE ACCIDENT WAS DISCOVERED THE DRIVER WAS STILL TRAPPED IN THE TRUCK BEEN HELD UP BY HIS SEAT BELT.  THE FIRST THING OUR DRIVERS DID ALONG WITH FIRE PERSONAL AND RESIDENTS WERE TO REMOVE OUR DRIVER A.S.A.P.  AFTER 20 MINUTES THE DRIVER WAS OUT OF THE TRUCK.  THE REASON THEY FOCUSED ON THE DRIVER IS BECAUSE THE TANK RUPTURED AND THERE WAS AND FUMES ALL AROUND THE DRIVER.  WHEN THE ACID TRUCK WENT OVER THE TREE STUMPS THE 3 IBC TANKS MADE OF POLYETHYLENE BURST OPEN CAUSING AN IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID.  WHEN THE TRUCK FINALLY CAME TO A STOP THE BACK OF THE TRUCK LANDED ON THE CORNER OF A HORSE STALL, WHICH TOTALLY DESTROYED THE LAST TANK.  THE TRUCK LANDED ON ITS PASS SIDE, WHICH ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF THE ACID.  THE TRUCK WAS CARRYING A TOTAL OF 1000 GALLONS OF 28% HYDROCHLORIC ACID.  THE FIRST 2 TANKS HAD 375 GALLONS AND THE LAST HAD 250 GALLONS.  ALL BUT 50 GALLONS WAS RELEASED ON TO THE GROUND.
