THE RECEIVING TANK WAS NOT PLUMBED WITH A SEPARATE FILL LINE, REQUIRING THE DRIVER TO REMOVE THE 90% OVERFLOW FITTING TO ALLOW FILLING THE TANK.  ACCORDING TO THE DRIVER THE TANK OVERFLOW ALARM WAS ALSO NOT FUNCTIONING.  DURING THE LOADING OF THE STORAGE TANK, THE DRIVER NOTED FUEL FLOWING OUT THE FILL HOLE.  THE FUEL RAN ACROSS A HARD PACKED DIRT OVER FLOW PARKING LOT, DOWN A SLOPE AND INTO A LOCAL STORM DRAIN, NOT CONNECTED TO ANY STORM SEWER SYSTEM OUTSIDE THE RESORT.  THE STORM SEWER EMPTIED INTO A RETENTION POND, WITH AN OVERFLOW TO A STREAM. NO FUEL LEFT THE RETENTION POND.  THERE WAS ALSO STANDING FUEL ON THE PARKING LOT AND AROUND THE STORAGE TANK.  A TOTAL OF 327 GALLONS WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE BEEN RELEASED. ACTION TAKEN AT THE TIME OF DISCOVERY: THE DRIVER STOPPED DISPENSING FUEL IMMEDIATELY UPON DISCOVERING THE OVERFLOW.  HE EVENTUALLY MADE CONTACT WITH PERSONNEL AT THE CANYONS RESORT TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED, CONTACTED HIS DISPATCH WHO CONTACTED TW COMPANY TO ASSIST IN THE CLEAN UP.  IN THE MEAN TIME, THE PARK CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT, UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL (UHP) HAZMAT DIVISION, AND SUMMIT COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN CALLED AND RESPONDED TO THE SCENE.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PLACED ABSORBENT PADS ON THE FUEL ON THE GROUND, MONITORED THE SEWER LINES FOR PRESENCE OF LEL AND SECURED THE AREA WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THE UHP.  THE RESORT PERSONNEL USED A TRASH PUMP TO BEGIN RECOVERING FUEL FROM THE GROUND AROUND THE TANK.  THE CANYONS, AND JARDINE PETROLEUM MADE NOTIFICATIONS TO NRC THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY, THE SERC AND THE LEPC.  TW COMPANY PLACED BOTH ABSORBENT AND CONTAINMENT BOOM IN THE RETENTION POND, MOVED THE FUEL TO A CONVENIENT LOCATION AND REMOVED IT USING A VACUUM TRUCK.  BOOMS WERE LEFT IN THE RETENTION POND WHILE REMOVAL OF THE FREE LIQUIDS OCCURRED UP GRADIENT AND DURING THE EXCAVATION OF THE CONTAMINATED SOILS.  ALL CONTAMINATED SOILS WERE EXCAVATED AND DISPOSED OF AS NON-REGULATED WASTE, SOLID NOS, ALONG WITH THE ABSORBENT BOOMS AND PADS, FOLLOWING LABORATORY ANALYSIS.  THE RECOVERED FUEL/WATER WAS DISPOSED OF AS A NON HAZARDOUS LIQUID ALSO FOLLOWING LABORATORY ANALYSIS.  TW COMPANY TOOK WATER SAMPLES DURING AND AFTER THE CLEANUP TO INSURE THAT NOT FUEL LEFT THE RETENTION POND AND THAT THE CLEAN UP WAS COMPLETE AND SUCCESSFUL.  DURING AD AFTER THE REMOVAL OF CONTAMINATED SOILS DIRECT READING WERE TAKEN USING A PHOTO IONIZATION DETECTOR (PID) TO CONFIRM LOCATION OF AND ADEQUATE REMOVAL OF THE CONTAMINATED SOILS.  RUN OFF DURING THE CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES WAS CONTROLLED WITH STRAW BAILS TO KEEP SEDIMENT FROM REACHING THE STORM SEWER.
