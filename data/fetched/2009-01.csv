After the car is empty of liquid the large volume of air is then allowed to partially exit through the hose until the operator feels the car is completely empty.  This rush or air causes the flexible hose to shake and/or move which is normal.  After the operator observed the hose movement for a minute or so, and was about to close the valve, the locking ears on the camlock connection disengaged allowing the hose to disconnect from the top of the car.  This allowed the large volume of remaining air trapped inside the car to rapidly exit through the unobstructed 2"" siphon tube on top of the car.  The air depleted within a few minutes and carried sulfuric acid mist with it.  The acid mist was carried by the wind and spread acid droplets onto the property next door contaminating pipeline, equipment, and a few automobiiles.  No personnel came into contact with the mist.  a contracted Environmental crew washed and neutralized all pipeline and equipment.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected GATX 15765 and found an open orifice atop the valve housing plate that should have been sealed with a 2 1/2 inch pipe plug.

The truck continued to slide over the top of the guide rail and down an embankment (drop of approximately 12-15 feet).  At the bottom of the embankment the truck apparently flipped over on its roof and slid an additinoal 50 feet until it stopped.  Despite severe vehicle damage to the cab, the driver was able to exit the cab and climb up to the Interstate where he flagged a motorist down for assistance.  The box was heavily damaged ejecting a number of the containers including 6 chlorine cylinders and a drum of potassium permangante.  An Emergency Response Contractor (Weavertown Envioronmental) was called to assist with the cleanup and a team was also dispatched from the branch to assist the contractor.    The response personnel removed the cylinders (not leaking) and overpacked the drum of which was clear of the truck.  The emergency response contractor then had to pump the fuel out of the saddle tanks before the truck could be rolled over to prevent possible leakage.  A wrecker was then positioned to pull the truck over onto its side off of the rest of the damaged freight.    When the material under the truck was accessible it was noted that one of the IBC's of sodium hydroxide (caustic soda 30%) solution had been pierced by a portion of the separated metal e-track load securement device.

At approximately 7:30am, the weather was a wintry mix. It was raining/snowing and the roads were icing up. There was an accident ahead of our driver because of the bad weather. Mr.   Villegas then got on the brakes to slow down in order to avoid getting collected up in the accident. When he did this, he hit a patch of ice and the tractor and trailer jack knifed. The trailer ended up in the center   median lying partially on its side.   The trailer (which was a compartment trailer) had product leaking out of 3 of the 4 compartments. The Montgomery County Haz-mat team responded to the scene and tightened all of the ears around the   domes, this eliminated what was leaking out of the trailer. Prior to the Haz Mat team getting there buckets and temporary pools were set up underneath the dome areas to contain whatever product came out of the domes. The products that leaked were Butyl Carbitol Solvent and Glycol Ether Acetate. It is estimated that about 70 gallons of product leaked out of the trailer. The responders recovered approximately 50 gallons. The remaining product remained in the center median and was collected into absorbent rags or went into the ground. HMHTTC was called into trans-load the material from one trailer into another and they also took care of cleaning up the area. They worked with the Illinois EMA office when they did the clean up.",THE DRIVER RETURNED BACK TO THE TERMINAL AND WENT THROUGH REFRESHER TRAINING AND WAS TERMINATED.  HE WENT THROUGH TRAINING ON DRIVING IN EXTREME WEATHER AND HOW TO PROPERLY INSPECT A TRAILER.  IN THE END THIS SPILL OCCURRED BECAUSE THE DRIVER FAILED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE EARS IN THE DOME AREA WERE PROPERLY FASTENED.

The driver first opened the trailer internal valve. Than he slowley started to open   the external valve. As he was slowley turning the valve handle the produck would not flow he than opened the valve some more than there was a rush of material that over shot the spill bucket and onto the concrete pad. Driver quickly closed the valve and tried again. the spilled material quickly evaporated.,The driver failed to follow proceedure as he was trained. he should have had the spill bucket up off the ground and at the product discharge line. When he could not get product to flow through the external valve he should have stopped and closed the internal valve first that try to oped the external valve again. The gasket on the external valve can sometines stick to the valve seat and can suddenly pop open leaving an wider gap between the gasket and the seat than intended and allowing the product to flow faster.

The shipment arrived via rail at CSXI Chicago terminal in Bedford Park, IL, and was transported via truck to the BNSF terminal to continue its move to destination.  The BNSF rejected the shipment back to CSXI because the applied placards were too low on the sides of the container.  A copy of the bill of lading was requested from Mediterranean Shipping Co. Upon review of the provided bill of lading, it was discovered that there was a product listed on the bill of lading that was not declared on the original shipping instructions provided to CSXI. The undeclared commodity is Turpentine Substitute, 3, UN 1300, III.  CSXI contacted Mediterranean Shipping Co. regarding the discrepancy.

The trailer was isolated and TAS Environmental Services, Inc. of San Antonio, Texas was dispatched to investigate the trailer and perform the cleanup.  TAS Environmental Services, Inc. donned the proper personal protective equipment and proceeded to investigate the trailer.  TAS Environmental Services, Inc. determined that a pallet broke during transit, and that a nail from the pallet punctured one of the drums.  Approximately 4 gallons of free product were released and impacted the trailer floor.  TAS Environmental Services, Inc. performed the cleanup using absorbent material and absorbent pads. The cleanup materials, impacted pallet, personal protective equipment, and leaking drum were placed into three over pack drums.

The package was isolated placed in a salvage drum and the spilled material was recovered too.  During the investigation, it was found that the shipment was offered as an Excepted Quantity of Methanol, UN 1230.  In fact the quantity far exceeded the 30ml allowable amount and there was no Methanol in the package.  Instead it was found to be a 10% Formalin Solution.  It was also determined that the shipper had been trained to offer Infectious Substances and Dry Ice only.  Training could not be verified for Excepted Quantities or other hazard classes.  The package had no absorbent nor cushioning material.  The driver, Eric Poland, complained of irraitation to his eyes, nose and throat.  He sought medical attention at a local emergency clinic.  Mr. Poland was cleared for full duty for the following business day.  It was initially reported that FAA SA Beth Romo was present at the FedEx station when the incident occurred.  In fact that was false as SA Romo had stopped by the FedEx Ramp that evening.  As I was working under the pretense that FAA had knowledge of the incident, we allowed the shipment to be reclaimed by the shipper before pictures could be taken.

Movement was stopped and UTLX 200376 was cordoned off in the railyard awaiting responder inspection. BNSF contract responders reported finding liquid product seeping out at the 3 inch liquid valve's closure plug. The liquid valve handle was not attached and the responders found the valve slightly open with its closure plug not tool tight. The liquid valve was also loose at its threaded connection but did not leak at this orifice. The liquid valve was removed and thread sealant applied. While the valve was off, the product outage was checked and it was deemed appropriate. The liquid valve was reapplied in its closed position along with its closure plug, also with new thread sealant. Both were tool tightened. All other valves and fittings were inspected and deemed secure. The spillage on the tank shell that didn't evaporate was wiped. A small area of impacted soil/ballast under UTLX 200376 was shoveled into a five gallon bucket for appropriate future disposal. No further product release was observed from UTLX 200376 during subsequent rail movements.  Intact Suncor seals removed numbered 124151 and 124152.

Movement was stopped. Later, GATX 68603 was carefully moved to a mechanical repair track in the railyard awaiting responder inspection. BNSF contract responders observed liquid product that was hardening on the mid-side tank shell and side ladder. The spillage emanated from the manway cover. All six manway securement bolts were found to be less than tool tight. The manway gasket was inspected and it appeared to be deteriorated or worn. This combination of loose manway cover securement and a faulty gasket prevented a good seal at the manway nozzle/cover closure. Product outage appeared appropriate. The responders applied a new Salco neoprene gasket and properly secured/tool tightened the manway securement bolts. All other valves and fittings were checked and found secure. The spillage on the tank shell (top and side) and side ladders were wiped down and cleaned off as much as possible. No significant ground impact atop the soil/ballast under GATX 68603 was observed. No further product release was observed from GATX 68603 during subsequent rail movements.  Intact Murphy Oil seals removed numbered 40176 and 40185.

When the driver raised the pallet of drums to exit the trailer one of the drums struck a supporting screw to the securement device that extended out from the trailer wall. This resulted in a small leak to the upper chime of the container. Upon noticing the leak the forklift driver placed the drum on it's side to stop the leak.,A review of the incident was conducted by facility personnel. It was determined that the securement device fastner/screw needed to be reconfigured so that it would not extend off the wall of the trailer. A formal complaint was documented and sent to the carrier for their response.

When the shipment arrived at the Elkton, MD HUB facility, it was found leaking on the tail of the trailer. The freight was loaded on the tail of the trailer and a visual inspection of the carton revealed the carton was wet. Further inspection of the carton’s contents revealed small dents in 2 of the 4 cans and a small fracture to the bottom seam of the leaking can resulting in ¾ of 1 gallon to be released. There was no visible evidence of impact to the carton i.e. freight on or fallen around the shipment.  The outer carton has a small crease in the bottom quarter of the package on the long side (pictures attached). Loading of hazardous materials or small liquid shipments on the tail of the trailer is not an approved practice of Estes Express Lines.

The release was managed in 20 minutes and the released product was placed in a recovery area.

When facility p[ersonnel opened the trailer door, they identified  a petroleum odor.  The emergency response plan was activated and dock personnel were removed from the area while an assesment was made.  Using appropriate personal protective equipment, the trailer was entered and it was determined that approximately 2 gallons of material had been released from a crack that developed in the top clsoure of the container.  Formal notification was made pursuant to the facility's operating permit and an in-house response was initiated.  Facility personnel placed the damaged container into a suitable salvage drum along with all material used to absorb all freee liquids and clean the trailer floor.  This container was then placed on the vehicle for continued transportation.","AT the time the container was accepted for transportation, the driver inspected the container and did not see evidence of a leak.

The Driver was pulled to safety by a local businessman before the tanker caught fire.  It is not known where the initial release occured but there were reports from people at the scene that product was coming out of the airspace between the double bulkhead between compartments #4 and #5 which would mean one of those bulkheads cracked and product entered the airspace and vented to the outside since it is an open area.  The Fire Department allowed the unit to keep burning for several hours to mitigate the environmental damage.

The shipper was contacted the obtain an MSDS on the material in the IBC.  Acid neutralizer was used on the small amount of liquid that was released in the trailer.  Due to the crack looking like a split in the plastic, and the IBC being properly blocked and braced, and nothing loaded on top, it appeared as if the crack was caused by the material and package freezing, although this is just an estimate. The temperature during transportation and the material sitting on the dock was well below freezing. The identification markings on the tote are very long, and may not all be required on question 26a, however, everything on the packaging identification sticker has been entered on this question just to make sure.","If the crack is determined to have been caused by the material freezing, then the shipper will be notified that their package was inadequate.

Further investigation discovered that the pallet that was staged next to the IBC on the dock must have slightly hit the bottom valve handle on the IBC to the open position resulting in the unintentional release of the residue product that remained in the IBC. Spilled material was cleaned with sorbent material and valve handle was positioned in the closed position to prevent further spillage.,"In past experiences with incidents such as these - it always seems to happen because the valve handle sticks out beyond the confines of the IBC down at the bottom. Yes, our material handlers should be paying attention to their clearances and be on the alert of these protruding valve handles - but I just wish that there was some way these valve handles could be protected better at the bottom discharge lines or be required to be with in the confines of the IBC to prevent these types of unintentional releases from occurring.",No,IBC,"Metal, for liquids or solids",31A,Yes,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,A.

At 1:30am due to the freezing roadway Lt Nicholson instructed Marion Evironmental to place cones around spill area and to return the next morning to continue clean up. At 9:30am 1/23/09 clean up commenced again and Marion Evironmental used dilute sulfuric acid to neutralize the caustic. They then applied absorbent materials and sweep up the area to dispose of all material.  Marion Evironmental estimated the spill to be between 25 - 50 gallons.  The RQ for 50% sodium hydroxide is 156 gallons. Our investigation determined that on 1/22/09 a plant employee failed to secure the dome lid on the tanker after trying to remove the freezing caustic in the tanker. It was also determined that the driver failed to perform as complete pre-trip and secure the lid after hooking up to this tanker.  As he left the plant some of the unfrozen caustic spilled out of the dome.,Retraining on all tanker drivers on relief valves/pressure/pre-trips including our in house checklist.  Disciplinary action taken with this driver for failure to utilize the mandatory checklist required by the company for tanker drivers prior to leaving the plant. - He received a 3 day suspension  Training done on plant employees involved with tanker truck loading and on the securement of products including tankers within the plant,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6373,Allied Universal Corp,US,

Phase I occurred on January 30, 2009. The shipment was loaded from Winchester, VA (origin) through Greensboro where it was transferred to move to Houston. The Greensboro terminal stacked another shipment on top of the cartons of paint. In transit the top of 1 of the cans was crushed causing a release of .5 LGA that was recognized U/A at the Dallas terminal. The Dallas terminal took 2 cans of paint that were affected by the release (1 crushed and 1 contaminated), and placed them in a suitable recovery container and moved the shipment onto Houston for delivery in Beaumont, TX. The release was managed in approximately 45 minutes.     Phase II occurred on February 2, 2009. Dallas loaded the shipment on the tail of the trailer for Houston. During transit a valve that was not properly blocked or braced fell on the carton previously recouped at the Dallas terminal. U/A to Houston, the product was noticed leaking. All the product from the 2 gallons contained in the carton had been released as the lids popped off due to the impact of the valve. In both incidents the product was contained in the carriers trailer. The product was properly recovered and placed in a UN approved container and will disposed of properly according to regulations. No human exposures occurred during either release. The release was managed in approximately 60 minutes.",,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Estes Express Lines,US,

This resulted in a derailment of 14 railcars when the shoved railcars collided with railcars on the switching lead. DBUX 207791 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) the first railcar in the shove movement derailed on its side with a slow drip of product emanating from its manway closure. BNSF contract responders tighten the manway securement bolts on DBUX 207791 in an attempt to stop the product dripping at the manway cover/nozzle closure. This effort significantly reduced the product drips. Responders constructed an earthen poly lined berm to contain the dripping product impacting the ground. DBUX 207791 was uprighted which ended any further product release. Granular absorbent was applied atop the impacted soil/ballast to solidify the spillage. Afterwards, the impacted soil/ballast was shoveled into 55 gallon recovery drums for appropriate waste disposal. Equipment damage to DBUX 207791 necessitated product transfer to another suitable tank car. DBUX 207791 was then scheduled to be cleaned and purged of hazardous material.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4510,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The driver then filled his tanker and completed his first 7 deliveries.  For his 8th delivery, he was reversing up the driveway when he heard a loud “pop” which seemed to come from under his tanker and saw a white mist coming from behind the tanker’s cab.  He immediately drove the tanker out of the driveway, parked it on the side of the road, and turned off the engine.  He got out to investigate and saw LPG leaking near the pump area.  He could not pinpoint the leak because of poor visibility due to the white mist and ice that had formed around the pump and internal valve.  He called TGC’s Maui office to report the incident.  The driver attempted to close the internal valve but the LPG kept coming out.  He set up cones and triangles about 100 feet in both directions and directed pedestrians and vehicles away from the tanker.      The Maui Fire Department (MFD) arrived on scene and established a command post at a shopping center parking lot nearby.  In the interim, TGC had dispatched an empty tanker to the site to remove the LPG from the malfunctioning tanker.  MFD instructed TGC not to transfer any LPG until the State Airport’s foam truck arrived.  When the foam truck arrived, TGC’s leadman checked the actuator under the tank and found it to be in the closed position.  As it was then determined that the LPG could not be removed from the leaking tanker, the decision was made, after discussions with the Incident Commander (MFD), to tow the truck to an isolated area.  Once towed, TGC’s crew setup a flare to burn off the propane in the tanker with the MFD fire truck standing by.  When the tanker’s liquid level gauge reached 40%, a brass hammer was used to hit the fisher valve, causing it to close, stopping the LPG from leaking.      The tanker was brought back to TGC’s Maui baseyard for inspection and repairs.  A 1/8” gap between the pump and the flange was noted, which is suspected to be where the LPG leaked.  The gap was created by the loose bolts on the intake port of the pump.    TGC estimates the duration of the release was approximately 9 hours.","1.  Review the procedures and history of the tanker to try and determine how or why the bolts were loose.    2.  Evaluate feasibility of installing another valve under the tanker instead of a plug, to provide an emergency alternative to transfer LPG, if needed.    3.  Contact tanker manufacturer to discuss whether there are any feasible alterations to insure that the internal valve operates properly and whether there is a better way to secure the bolts so that it will be harder for them to come loose.",Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,1900,"THE GAS COMPANY, LLC",US,

At this time the front passenger tire traveled into a small snow bankthat bordered a ditch. The truck got sucked into the ditch. When the truck came to a complete stop it fell on its passenger side causing a small propane leak in the hose going to the swivel on the hose reel. The road is in a private development and is narrow. At the time of the accident, the road was snow packed covered and slippery.The ditch that the truck was in is about three feet deep and about six feet wide with no guide rail.The driver reported the incident immediately and we responded and got to the scene within 10 minutes. Upon arrival we made certain that the driver was all right. In which he was. Then we contained the small leak that was limited to the swivel hose. At this point the fire department and the two wreckers arrived. We then vented the propane from the hose into a wooded area with a spray of water from the fire department. The duration of the small leak was about one half hour. The truck was then safe to be lifted up on its wheels by the two wreckers. The truck was then towed back to our plant where all necessary repairs were made.There was no damage to the cargo tank, piping or valves. The small leak was limited to the swivel hose that connects to the hose reel. No diesel fuel, motor oil or antifreeze was released.",Always remain focused on the task at hand.

WAS HEADING NORTH ON HIGHWAY 35 NEAR THE FOREST MISS. CITY LIMITS WHEN, AFTER TOPPING A HILL THE DRIVER CAME UPON TWO NORTHBOUND CARS STOPPED IN THE HIGHWAY.  THE LEAD CAR WAS STOPPED AND WAITING FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC TO PASS BEFORE TURNING LEFT INTO A DRIVEWAY.  THE DRIVER OF THE PROPANE TRUCK NOT HAVING TIME TO STOP, VERRED TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD TO AVOID HITTING THE TWO STOPPED CARS.  AFTER PASSING THE TWO CARS THE PROPANE TRUCK DRIVER THEN ATTEMPTED TO STEER BACK ON THE HIGHWAY BUT THE ATTEMPT RESULTED IN THE PROPANE TRUCK OVERTURNING AND COMING TO REST ON ITS LEFT SIDE, HALF ON AND HALF OFF OF THE HIGHWAY.  THERE WAS NO CONTACT WITH THE OTHER TWO VEHICLES BUT THERE WAS DAMAGED TO THE PROPANE TRUCK WHICH RESULTED IN A PROPANE GAS LEAK FROM A DAMAGED FITTING NEAR THE METER AT THE REAR OF THE TRUCK.  THE DRIVER OF THE PROPANE TRUCK RECEIVED ONLY MINOR BURSES AND NO ONE ELSE WAS INVOLVED.  BECAUSE OF THE PROPANE LEAK WHICH OCCURRED NEAR THE METER AT THE REAR OF THE TRUCK, POLICE AND HIGHWAY PATROL AUTHORITIES DECIDED TO CLOSE THE HIGHWAY UNTIL THE LEAK COULD BE STOPPED AND WRECKED TRUCK TOWED AWAY.  AFTER HAVING BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE ACCIDENT, FOUR BOUTWELL GAS CO. EMPLOYEES RESPONDED TO THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT.  EVENTUALLY AN INSPECTOR WITH THE L C GAS DIVISION OF THE MISS. STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S OFFICE RESPONDED TO THE SCENE TO OFFER ADVICE.  AFTER SOME DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK AND THE CORRECT VALVE TO TURN OFF THE GAS SUPPLY, THE LEAK WAS STOPPED IN ABOUT TWO HOURS.  THE TRUCK WAS THEN SET UPRIGHT AND TOWED AWAY IN A TOTAL OF ABOUT THREE HOURS AFTER THE WRECK OCCURRED.  HIGHWAY 35 WAS THEN REOPENED.  WHAT PROPANE LEAKED OUT EVAPORATED WITHIN MINUTES AND WAS NOT A SAFETY FACTOR AFTER THE LEAK WAS STOPPED.  THE PROPANE TRUCK AND TANK CHASSIS WERE LATER DETERMINED TO BE ""TOTALED"" BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY.

The delivery truck was delivering chemicals to Cintas Corporation. The truck was parked on the North side of the building and the Bork Transport driver was off-loading chemical from the tanker truck into plant tanks. While pumping from one of the truck compartments on his truck to the plant tank, he noticed that another compartment on his truck was frozen. The driver began warming the external valves on the frozen compartment to get the chemical to flow. The valves started to warm up and a slight drip began from the valve. The driver went to secure the hose, but the drip turned into a heavier flow which prevented him from securing the hose. The entire compartment of chemical off-loaded into the Northeast corner of the Cintas Corporation parking lot. The compartment contained 1100 gallons (13640 pounds) of Sodium Hydroxide 40%-60%. John Lavarota, Dober Research Works, witnessed the entire event. Cintas Corporation purchases this chemical from Dober Research Works, who contracts the delivery of the chemical to Bork Transport.   At 4:16 p.m., Jake Resser, Cintas Corporation’s Plant Manager at the Schaumburg location, called 911 and reported both the Hazmat incident as well as potential chemical burns to the driver of the Bork Transport chemical tanker truck. At 4:21 p.m., The Village of Schaumburg Fire Department and The Village of Schaumburg Police Department arrived at Cintas Corporation. At 5:35 p.m. Bork Transport The chemical had completely leaked out of the tanker compartment by this time. The Police Department secured the area of the spill. The Fire Department immediately isolated the chemical and evaluated the extent of spill. They determined that the material had entered a facility storm water drainage and discharges into a ditch across the street They placed hazmat pigs at the end of the drainage ditch to absorb and prevent further migration. The PH was tested on-site by the Fire Department and was determined to be 12.0. There was no impact to the city sanitary sewer or any other storm sewer systems. Hazmat pigs were also placed in the parking lot, even though most of the chemical had already froze on the pavement.   At 5:55 p.m., Jake Resser notified the Illinois EPA of the spill. The case number was H20090037. Mr. Resser spoke to Paul Kattner, who notified him Jim Clark, IEPA Des Plaines, would be in contact with him the following day. At 6:00 p.m., the Schaumburg Fire Department notified the National Response Center. At 6:15 p.m., the Schaumburg Fire Department notified the TEMA to confirm the case number from the JEPA. At 6:20 p.m., Chris Johnson, Hazchem Environmental Corp, and David Gray, Bork Transport, arrived at the scene. At this time, Mr. Gray acknowledged that Bork Transport was at fault of the spill and Bork Transpor",CINTAS:    WE NO LONGER USE BORK TRANSPORT AS A CARRIER.
