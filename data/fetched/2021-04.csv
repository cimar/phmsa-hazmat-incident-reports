The drum fell ~6-8 inches to the floor causing the lid to pop off of the drum. As a result, approximately 250 ml of the sludge material within the container splashed on to the floor of the warehouse.  The Veolia employee immediately applied absorbent material on top of the spilled material and reclosed the drum. While closing drum it was noticed the closure ring on top of the drum had a little bit of paint chipped off and was slightly bent.  The Veolia employee immediately informed the supervisor who then reported the incident to appropriate personnel and determined how to proceed in regards to this event.  The drum was overpacked into a salvage drum to continue transportation.","The shipment was a brokered load that was shipped to Veolia.  Veolia will follow up with the customer to remind them of proper container selection when loading hazardous materal/waste.  Veolia will also recommend to not package material similar to this to such a high capacity within poly open head drums, since poly drums are less rigid than metal drums, thus allowing container to shift and deform when heavy materials apply force to them.

The issue was identified  and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Eastman (Lisa Feathers 423-229-3398).  HEPACO transferred the product from TAMX1030 to tank car TAMX1010. TAMX1030 has been cleaned and purged and is awaiting an OTMA-3 to move to home shop for repairs. The car is on hold pending repairs coordinated by the shipper.

The car was isolated and the shipper, National Response Center, Ohio EPA, the local LEPC and Local Fired Department were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2021-0406-000190). Enviroserve, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found multiple leak points from the bottom of the car, emanating from beyond the tank jacket interface, suggesting a tank shell failure. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative Mr. Joseph Eskra of the Lubrizol Corporation, phone 440-364-9372. Contractor personnel secured a secondary containment system, and then performed an emergency transfer of the car's content's into tank trucks, and finally cleaned and purged the car. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move.

The leak occurred on a box truck in the ESI 10 day transfer area prior to Veolia employees transferring the container to a tractor trailer. Employees saw the leak when they started to transfer the waste with a pallet jack to move the IBC into a trailer.  Employees opened the container and noticed a very sludge-like material that had free liquid in it. Additionally some large debris items were placed in the container for disposal by the shipper. Additional speedi-dri was added to the container to absorb free liquid in the container.    The container was observed for a day to ensure it stopped leaking prior to reoffering it for continued transportation to the ultimate disposal facility. The total amount of material that leaked from the container was estimated to be about 1 pint of class 9 hazardous waste. It is opined that the large objects that were placed in the container caused a tear in the liner of the IBC. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and speedi-dri was added to the IBC to stop the leaking  The duration of release is anticipated to be a small drip from the drum for about 12 hours with no more than a pint leaking. The leak was contained to the truck and did not reach outside the vehicle. The Veolia safety manager of Marlborough, MA was notified and the Connecticut DEEP was also notified. The shipper was notified of the leak and will use drums in the future to avoid leaks with the material.",The shipper will load the material into drums in the future to avoid leaks.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The car was isolated  and the shipper Westrock were notified (CHEMTREC Report #2021041600335). Hulls Environmental,  a CSXT response contractor and Josh Dearing Manager of Hazardous Material for CSX, was  dispatched to the scene and found 3 of 6 manway safety bolts less than tool tight.  Upon  inspection the manway was opened and found that the manway gasket was not properly in  place and damaged. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper  Julie Baty, 804-317-0434. Contractor personnel replaced the manway gasket with a new gasket  and tool tightened the manway safety bolts and no decontamination of the tank car was needed.   The leak was secured and the car released for transport. This incident did not require a special  switching  move.","(NAR cause code: 208 5  What Failed: Manway, Hinged & Bolted  Where Failed: Connection between manway nozzle and manway cover  Why Failed: Gasket misaligned )",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3000,CSX CORPORATION,US,

There was no evidence of a leak at the time. The driver had exhausted his HOS for the shift and had stopped at a hotel for the night. When he was conducting his post trip inspection, he noticed a few drips of liquid on the ground and identified the source as a failed welded seam on a stainless steel reinforcement plate where the bottom discharge elbow attached to the trailer body. He immediately placed a containment under the drip and pulled a slight vacuum on the trailer. This stopped the drip and prevented any more material from being released.",Inspection and maintenance records were reviewed for this trailer to ensure that all were current. The VIK and all maintenance was within the acceptable time frames and nothing was delinquent. The Branch was instructed to inspect all other DOT 407 trailers to check for visible defects in the welded seams in the area where the leak originated from. No other trailers had visible defects. The trailer that leaked was taken to a truck wash and put in the shop for diagnostics and repairs immediately.

When the employees got into the back of the truck they noticed a drum was starting to bulge. The employees noticed it was the drum of Peracetic acid that was repacked into a poly drum while onsite at UPS. As the drum continued to bulge Veolia employees cleared the back of the truck and made sure to warn the customer that they were going to hear a ""pop"". After a minute or two the drum popped the top off and the Veolia employees could see the fumes from the reaction coming from the drum. After checking that it was safe, the truck was pulled into a vacant parking lot away from the building. Veolia employees donned APR respirators and Tyvek suits to enter the back and remediate the drum. The drum contained two green bags each containing 3 or 4 containers of product. 3 bottles from one bag were completely empty and 4 from the other were completely intact. Veolia believes the reaction was from the three bottles contents leaking onto the absorbent used by UPS (possibly cat litter or oil dry. the absorbent was very fine.) The product was separated from the absorbent but still had some reaction in the vermiculite. The material was then soaked with ~15 gallons of cold water and the reaction stopped soon after.  Veolia has not had any further issues with the two containers of separated material.",Moving forward Veolia will be rejecting any bags that contain damaged or leaking peroxyacetic or peroxyacetic spill clean up. (i.e. If Veolia arrives on site and we notice the bag has vermiculite or spill dry inside or the bottle is leaking we would reject the drum until UPS soaks the contents of the bag with water.) Veolia will only package any bottles that are not damaged or leaking.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The tractor and forward trailer of the tandem trailer unit (OA4519) were severely damaged by the fire. As a result, the tractor released approximately (50) gallons of diesel fuel to the roadway and adjacent soil drainage ditch. The cargo in the trailer included 55-gallon metal drums of UN1866 resin solution which were damaged in the fire and released resin solution to the soil ditch and surface water. RLC retained Cura Emergency Services, LC (CES), who dispatched a crew from Enviroserve, Inc. (ESI) to perform the necessary corrective action. ES deployed absorbent boom and dams to contain the release in the ditch line. Crews recovered the remaining resin drums and loaded into a lined roll-off box for disposal. The roll-off box was transported to the RLC terminal in Columbiana to be staged for profiling. ES utilized a vacuum truck to recover impacted surface water from the ditch. ES mobilized a mini excavator and skid steer to perform a surface scrape of the impacted soils. The impacted soils were loaded into one (1) roll-off box for transport and disposal. The excavation was then seeded and strawed.

We fill a smaller 250 gallon tank and a customer’s employee transfers the acid at the same time to a larger tank.   Once driver started offload, Chemart EE 1 began to transfer into their larger tank.  During this transfer, the customer’s EE 1 asked driver to watch the tank for him so he could take care of something.  Driver watched tank with no issues then shortly after the customer’s EE 1 came back and said he was taken over and Driver returned to his trailer.   5 minutes later customer EE 2 ran out of the building and said that the tank was over flowing so Driver immediately stopped the delivery.  Once the delivery was stopped, Driver went into the building to see how much was in the containment.   Driver noticed approx. 10 gallons in the containment area and nothing was near a drain or got outside the tank containment.  Chemart began to put water on the HCL to start the cleanup process and as a result of this the Acid began to smoke which resulted in the building being evacuated and the fire department being called.   Univar Solutions notified the RIDEM’s spill hotline at 9:07 am to report the release as a precaution as RIDEM’s reportable quantity requires immediate notification for releases where there is a threat or risk of adverse effects on human health (i.e. a need to evacuate a building).    Release was caused by failure of customer's transfer pump which caused an overfill of the smaller day tank.",Customer's pump was replaced.

Upon retrieving them from the floor, there was no apparent damage to the cell phone, but the power bank was getting hot to the touch indicating the possible beginning of Thermal Runaway.  Recognizing what this meant, the Customer notified the Inflight Crewmembers.  The aircraft was five minutes from its scheduled departure time when the Captain was informed of the situation.  All Customers had been boarded by this time.  No clearance to push back or Weight and Balance information had been received as yet.  The Captain reported hearing someone yell ""fire"" and jumped out of his seat to see what was wrong.  The aircraft was already being evacuated.  The Captain further stated the Power Bank had been moved into the jetbridge where the Inflight Crewmember placed it into a metal trash bin and poured water on it.  It was then carried outside of the jetbridge to the ramp area.  The Captain estimates all Customers were off the aircraft within three minutes of the onset of smoke.  Airport Rescue & Fire Fighting (ARFF) arrived on scene and the Captain asked them to perform a walkthrough of the aircraft where no remaining smoke, fire source, or evidence of fire was found.  JetBlue Technical Operations Crewmembers also did a walkthrough of the cabin to check for damage.  They reported minor damage to the carpeting where the battery was dropped.  The aircraft was removed from service.  The Captain did a check on the Crewmembers and found that one of the Inflight Crewmembers was feeling unwell.  Out of an abundance of caution, the Crewmember was sent for medical review.  After medical review the Crewmember was released.  The Customers were boarded onto another aircraft and the flight departed to its final destination, Cartagena, Costa Rica (CTG).",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,820,JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION,US,

The Pioneer Transportation CTMV struck another vehicle that was in the roadway from a previous accident. The Pioneer Transportation CTMV then traveled into the median and rolled onto its side colliding with a concrete abutment. Upon colliding with the concrete abutment, the cargo tank was damaged and experienced a release of an estimated 80 gallons sodium hydroxide solution. There were no injuries as a result of the release. The sodium hydroxide solution remaining in the damaged CTMV was trans-loaded into another CTMV.  All released material was collected in the concrete spillway. Remedial efforts are being conducted by Clean Harbors on Pioneer's behalf, under the supervision of ADOT.  Update to Initial Report: After further review, it was determined that the initial release estimate of 80 galloons did not account for all material released from the CTMV during the event. Based on a material balance (material shipped vs. material returned), the updated release estimate is 139 gallons.

After the first stop, the driver put a strap across the back of two hazmat totes before departing for the next stop. He noticed one of the totes was at a slight angle but added the strap thinking it would be ok. Because the tote was at a slight angle it allowed the strap to make contact with the corner of the plastic IBC instead of the metal cage. During his drive the strap was making contact with the plastic on the corner causing extra pressure on the point. As a result a crack developed in the plastic allowing a slow leak. As soon as it was discovered the driver called in and was instructed to stay in place and wait for a clean up crew to arrive and do cleanup. The driver was at the flying J in Lebanon IN where he waited for cleanup. The strap caused a crack approximately four inches wide. It was on the tote corner approximately14 inches from the top of the tote. It leaked a potential maximum of about 1.5 hours. Upon discovery the drive parked and waited for cleanup. Emergency Management Inc out of Oklahoma sent a local contractor out to clean up the product and make the trailer safe for transport.",Due to the incident we reviewed our whole cargo securement process for improvements from the loading dock to the drivers transporting. With most all of our cargo we are able to use straps on the packaging with no issues to securement or damage to product containers. The flammable tote cages were an area we could make improvement to keep the strap from contacting the plastic totes. We are going to incorporate Veeboards to cover the corner of the totes so the strap will not be able to make contact. The toes will be loaded next to the side and the strap wrapped around the tote to secure it to the side and another strap behind and in front as needed.  Loading personnel are retrained on cargo securement with the new process and a renewed awareness of potential issues and the consequences. The drivers were additionally informed of the new process and encouraged to provide feedback on cargo securement through our feedback process.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,17476,"JM SWANK LLC, JRRW TRANSPORT",US,
