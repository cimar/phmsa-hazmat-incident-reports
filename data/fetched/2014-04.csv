When going in with the final tote it was placed on the floor, and the then forklift was backed out of the tote. The weight of the first 2 totes loaded caused the trailer to drop even further. The forklift was driven back into the trailer to slide the tote up against the left side of the trailer. When going into the trailer the forklift slid on a piece of plywood that was on the floor causing the forks to puncture the tote. A combination of the trailer sitting so low and the plywood caused the forklift to slide. Almost all of  the tote was released and spilled into our yard, but did not go into any drainage.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Mosaic Fertilizer LLC, was notified CHEMTREC Report #2014-0418-00140.  Joseph McCann, a CSXT hazardous materials manager, was dispatched to the scene and found that the fill hole cover bolts were less than tool tight. While performing switching operations product released from the car landed on employee's arm causing a burning sensation. Employee was treated for first degree burns on his left forearm at a local hospital and released.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative Melody Russo 575-499-8349.  The release was secured, however, due to other exceptions that were not NAR contributors that were noted upon inspection the tank car was held in the terminal pending additional repairs.

Proper notifications were made by all involved.  Axial responded to the report and discovered AXLX 988, a loaded chlorine car, to be leaking. The point of release was the Pressure Relief Device (PRD). Axial responders installed a C-Kit (capping kit) onto the PRD securing the release. The Louisiana State Police hazmat responders inspected the capping kit and approved its installation. The protective housing cover was secured for movement. This car was subsequently moved into the Axial facility to be unloaded under 49CFR174.50. As information, this car was released by Axial (April 1, 2014) as an overload. The car was detected overloaded and was being moved back into the shipper facility. It is suspected that the overload caused the premature failure of the PRD.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.      (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

Also observed was entrained tank car NATX 250146 directly trailing TILX 220056 with commodity spray from TILX 220056. BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders inspecting TILX 220056 reported finding loose bolts on the flange connection of the valve pressure plate fitting or the protective housing nozzle flange connection. These loose stud bolts were tool tightened. The spillage pattern indicated that this unsecured flange connection was the primary leak source.  Afterwards, both TILX 220056 and NATX 250146 were moved and isolated in the railyard for cleaning of the commodity spillage and spray on their tank shells. This cleaning was accomplished on 4/18/2014. Earmarked for appropriate disposal was all rinsate that was captured, along with other spent cleaning materials. The response contractor tasked to clean the commodity spillage from these two tank cars also inspected the securement integrity of all other valves and fittings on TILX 220056. The contractor reported finding all four mounting flange bolt nuts loose on the liquid valve's flange connection and these were tool tightened.

Our driver states that he did not hear the train whistle nor could he see the train approaching because of the curve in the railroad tracks until he had started to cross the track. Our driver said that he tried to get across the track but did not make it and was struck by the train in the rear of the trailer just in front of the trailer wheels. The impact from the train caused the trailer to be turned over on its side and drug down the tracks about 100 feet along with the tractor which remained upright. None of the valves failed as all were shut off and the tank did not rupture or crack but because the tank was laying on its side the liquid CO2 was coming out of the vapor relief valve and changing to vapor as soon as it hit atmoshere. Until a couple of wreckers could come and upright the trailer and get the liquid CO2 away from the vapor safety it continued to vent to atmoshere.","Rankin County--the traffic control sign at the corner of Andrew Jackson Circle & Dixie Rd was changed from a Stop to a Yield sign.

The operator was transferring sodium hydroxide solution from a rail car, SHPX 201487. The operator was not monitoring the level indicator for the tank and the tank was overfilled. The release lasted for approximately 5 minutes. The area of the spill was approximately 10 feet wide by 40 feet long for an approximate area of 400 square feet. The temperature at the time of the spill was approximately 37°F, which was below the freezing point (53.6°F) of sodium hydroxide 50%. The caustic that spilled outside froze upon contact with the ground forming a boundary layer. We were able to recover most of the spill by neutralizing with citric acid, powder, and floor dry. The citric acid and floor dry was used to absorb the liquid portion of the spill and allowed for us to recover the material before it absorbed into the ground. The hazmat responders poured the floor dry on top of the spill and then mixed the floor dry into the liquid sodium hydroxide to absorb all the liquid sodium hydroxide from the top of the sodium hydroxide that had frozen on the ground. The floor dry was put into open top drums and open top totes (totes that had the top cut off). A contractor came in with a backhoe and the frozen sodium hydroxide and the gravel that was contaminated was removed and placed in open top drums and totes. The totes were transferred into drums and prepared to ship to our hazardous waste disposal company.",The operator was disciplined for not properly monitoring the unloading process. A root cause analysis was performed. Based on the results from the root cause we will evaluate the use of an automatic safety systems that will stop the flow of material into the tank. The cost of such system will be entered into the capital budget plan.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,11140,ALEXANDER CHEMICAL CORPORATION,US,

THIS RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY 700 GALLONS OF REGULAR UL GASOLINE TO BE DELIVERED INTO THE PREMIUM UL GASOLINE TANK.  WHILE MAKING THE DELIVERY, THE DRIVER REALIZED THE ERROR AND STOPPED THE FLOW OF PRODUCT. THE DRIVER CONTACTED THE TERMINAL AND ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL FROM PENN TANK LINES RESPONDED TO THE SITE. THE TANK WAS SCHEDULED FOR AN IMMEDIATE PUMP OVER OF PREMIUM UL INTO THE REGULAR UL TANKS. DURING THE PROCESS OF TRANSFERRING THE PRODUCT, THE CONTENTS OF THE PREMIUM TANK WERE PUMPED INTO ONLY ONE OF THE REGULAR TANKS. THIS TRANSFER OCCURRED WITH NO SPILL OR OTHER KNOWN ISSUES AT THAT TIME.  THE NEXT EVENING, ON SATURDAY, THE 12TH A DELIVERY WAS SCHEDULED INTO THE SAME WAWA STORE LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 9:00 PM. DURING THE DELIVERY, THERE WAS AN APPARENT PRESSURE ISSUE EXPERIENCED, WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF PRODUCT. IT APPEARS THAT THE OVERFILL PROTECTION FLAPPER CLOSED AND DUE TO EXCESS PRESSURE THE PRODUCT ESCAPED FROM THE CONNECTION TO THE UST. THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE INTERNAL VALVE SYSTEM ON THE TRAILER AND MADE ATTEMPTS TO MINIMIZE THE RELEASE OF PRODUCT. DUE TO THE EXCESS PRESSURE IN THE TANK, THE PRODUCT CONTINUED TO FLOW FROM THE FILL AREA. THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT RELEASED WAS ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY-FIVE (75) GALLONS. THE PRODUCT ENTERED INTO TWO SEPARATE STORM DRAINS BUT INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE DRAINS AND DID NOT TRAVEL FURTHER OR IMPACT ANY SOIL OR WATERWAYS.  LEWIS ENVIRONMENTAL WAS NOTIFIED BY WAWA REPRESENTATIVES AND RESPONDED TO THE SITE WITH REMEDIATION EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ONE TRUCK AND THREE WORKERS.  THEY SUBSEQUENTLY CALLED A FOURTH PERSON TO BRING AN AIR PUMP TO REMOVE SLUDGE AND GASOLINE FROM THE TWO STORM DRAINS. AFTER REVIEW AND TESTING, LEWIS ENVIRONMENTAL REPRESENTATIVES CONFIRMED THE PRODUCT IN THE DRAIN WAS CONTAINED AND HAD NOT TRAVELED FURTHER. TWO FIFTY-FIVE (55) GALLON DRUMS WERE UTILIZED FOR CONTAINMENT AND REMOVAL OF THE SLUDGE, PRODUCT & SPILL MATERIALS USED.  THE PA DEP WAS ALSO NOTIFIED (BOB BOWER BAUER @ 484-250-5900).
