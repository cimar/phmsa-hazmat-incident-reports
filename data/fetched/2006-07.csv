At the time of the release the vehicle was exiting Highway 84 at exit 31 near Bristol Connecticut.  Upon noticing a leak, the driver pulled the vehicle off the main travel section of the highway, set emergency flashers, and proceeded to the rear of the tanker vehicle to investigate the leak.  The driver determined that there was structural failure of the rear valve.  He noticed that the outside casing of the valve has developed a very small hole about one-half of an inch in diameter, and the hazardous material was slowly leaking out.  The tanker truck was carrying Waste Corrosive Liquid, n.o.s. (Nitric Acid Solution 10%) 8, UN 1760, PGIII picked up earlier that day from PraxAir Inc, in Bethlehem, PA.    The driver immediately applied vacuum to the trailer in order to prevent any additional material from leaking out.  He then notified his dispatch of an incident and the emergency contingency plan was activated.  An in-house emergency response crew was dispatched from CHES Bristol, CT service center located about three miles away.      Upon arrival, the emergency response crew placed containment around the rear of the trailer to mitigate any potential environmental contamination.  In addition an appropriate patching material was inserted into the damaged section of the valve to prevent any further release.  Concurrently, CHES notified the CT State police of the incident and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CT DEP).   State police arrived at the scene shortly after the event and initiated traffic control measures.  The CT DEP had instructed CHES to remain on the scene, take appropriate measures to contain the release, and await the arrival of CT DEP representative.    Due to the small diameter of the valve damage and a short duration of the spill, very small quantity of the material leaked out.    Approximately 1 hour after the initial spill was noted, a representative from CT DEP arrived and assessed the scene.  The representative was satisfied with the emergency response and the temporary repair to the valve assembly.  CT DEP representative took few pH measurements of the surrounding pavement and did not observe any contamination.  The tanker truck was escorted to the CHES Bristol facility to be offloaded.  The material was transported, offloaded and cleaned out without any further incidents.    CT DEP completed an internal report Case No. 2006-04181","Our initial investigation determined that the exterior knife-gate valve was manufactured out of carbon steel and aluminum not stainless steel as the remainder of the valves and the tanker.  Carbon steel is more susceptible to damage by low pH acidic materials.  During the loading process the corrosive solution flowed through this external valve therefore providing extended exposure of the valve to the acidic material.  In addition it was determined that the internal valve, which was manufactured out of stainless steel was not seating properly therefore permitting the material to weep through and rest in the exterior valve housing during the transit.      This tank unit was placed out of service pending the outcome of our investigation.  The exterior damaged portion of the valve will be replaced with an appropriate stainless steel valve, and the internal valve will undergo maintenance and repair if needed.  In addition the tanker will undergo another series of periodic tests prior to being release back into the circulation.      Additionally, all our internal and third party maintenance locations will be re-instructed to recognize the importance of having compatible and appropriate components on the tanker truck vehicles.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1200,Clean Harbors Environmental Services,US,

He had donned his PPE and began hooking up the trailer to unload the acid.  Driver was using the consignee's unload hose, which is standard operating procedure.  At approximately 9:15 am, he noticed acid spraying from consignee's hose as proceeded to shut down the unload operation.  The driver was sprayed with acid while attempting to close all valves and cease the operation.  The hose failed at a point approximately halway down the hose.  The hose had been kinked prior to this and weakened at this point.  Subsequent use weakened the hose further until it failed during the unload on 7-22-06.  The spilled acid was contained in a diked-off area and was reclaimed by mine personnel.  The driver used the safety shower to quench the acid on his PPE suit and was taken to the emergency room in Monticello, UT for observation.  He suffered minor burns to his wrist, cheek, neck and ears.  Soda ash and baking soda was used to neutralize the acid on and near the hose.",Drivers and mine personnel will be retrained in observing hoses in use at the mine.  Any hose that is questionable will be placed out of service and properly disposed of.  Better means of storage of the acid hose and more diligence in the use and care of the hoses.

CHEM-TEL WAS CALLED TO SEND AN MSDS SHEET AND LARRY FENNELL WAS CALLED TO DETERMINE THE COURSE OF ACTION. SINCE THE DRUM   CONTAINED NITRIC ACID, LARRY DETERMINED THAT AN OUTSIDE VENDOR SHOULD BE CALLED FOR THE CONTAINMENT AND CLEAN-UP. THE TRAILER WAS CLOSED AND PULLED TO THE YARD UNTIL INLAND WATERS ARRIVED. THE TRAILER WAS CHECKED PERIODICALLY. INLAND WATERS   WAS CALLED TO HAVE A TEAM DISPATCHED FOR THE CLEAN-UP. THE TEAM ARRIVED AT THE CONWAY I ROMULUS LOCATION AND THE TRAILER WAS BROUGHT TO A DOCK DOOR. INLAND WATERS SECURED THE AREA WITH CAUTION TAPE, CLEANED THE DRUM AND TRAILER. INLAND WATERS   WAS ASKED TO CHECK ALL OF THE CAPS ON THE DRUMS. THE ONLY CAP THAT WAS LOOSE OR LEAKING WAS ON THE 1ST DRUM AS MENTIONED ABOVE. THE CAP WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH A NEW CAP. THE CLEAN-UP OF THE DRUM AND NEW CAP WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE FREIGHT TO BE SHIPPED TO THE CUSTOMER, AJAX IN DETROIT. UPON INSPECTION OF THE CAP BY DOM SIMOTA OF INLAND WATERS, IT WAS DETERMINED BY DON THAT THE CAP WAS DEFECTIVE AND DID NOT PERFORM AS NECESSARY TO SECURE THE LIQUID IN THE DRUM.

When the trailer loaded full of totes was opened and inspected, 2 totes were found to have a very small amount of liquid leaking from the lids. ABF had to call a hazmat clean up team to t  he scene to secure the lids on the totes and wipe up the small amount of liquid. ~~The totes were loaded by the shipper on the trailer and were never touched by ABF. The shipper failed to secure the lids properly on all the totes prior to transportation.",Proper tightening of lids on totes prior to transportation needs to be done by the shipper. The shipper has been made aware of the incident and the cost of the response will be charged to the shipper.

The Kouts volunteer fire department responded and left the scene.,This corrosion might have been detected in a daily inspection of the bulk truck. The release could have been lessened if the driver had his remote control emergency device on his person.

While at the Flying J Truckstop off Interstate 80, at exit 209 in Rawlins, Wyoming, a leak was discovered coming from the Werner Enterprises trailer.  The Carbon County Fire Department was contacted, and responded to assess the site.  Approximately 1-2 gallons of free liquid was detected on the asphalt lot beneath the trailer.  The Carbon County Fire Department contained the free product prior to contractor arrival.  Rocky Mountain Pump Service was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon inspection of the trailer, it was determined that one (1) 55-gallon steel drum had been punctured by a forklift during loading.  Approximately 15 gallons of free product were released, with the majority contained inside the trailer.  Rocky Mountain Pump Service applied absorbent material to the free liquid inside the trailer.  Rocky Mountain Pump Service proceeded to overpack the damaged drum into one (1) 85-gallon steel recovery drum, along with the spent absorbent material, to be sent on to its destination.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be related to a forklift puncture during loading, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

When using these this type of manual cart one has to place a hook over the top seam and position two cleats underneath the bottom of the drum. When the operator pulls back on the cart the top hook helps to tip the drum back while forcing the two cleats underneath the drum itself to support it while moving it. When the driver tipped the cart and drum back one of the cleats on the bottom was not lined up properly to go underneath the drum. Instead, the cleat punctured the bottom of the drum contributing to the unintentional release. The drum was removed from the cart and laid on its side to prevent further release and repaired with drum putty. The spilled material was cleaned with absorbent and placed into a recovery container along with the damaged drum.",The driver involved with this release admitted that he failed to check the proper clearances of the cleats before he pulled the drum back.

All rail equipment remained upright. The cause of the derailment was due to the mainline switch being run through previously. Two tank cars of non-odorized propane (GATX 9638 & GATX 9669) were amongst the derailed rail equipment. GATX 9638 derailed upright with all wheels off the rail and GATX 9669 derailed upright with one set of trucks off the rail. Responders from the Big Valley Fire Protection District made the initial assessment that the propane tank cars were intact and not compromised, but lacking the proper gas detection/monitoring sensor equipment, the county sheriff decided to initiate a precautionary evacuation. The evacuation included an estimated 50 people and also closed down a portion of California State Route 299. Vehicle traffic was detoured onto a local thoroughfare (Foothill Road). After the gas sensor equipment arrived, responders confirmed that no propane was leaking from the two derailed tank cars. The evacuation and road closure were lifted around 1700 hrs.

BOX 158,BESSIE,OK,73622,Carrier,"On the afternoon of July l4, at approximately 3:00 pm, an employee of the Farmers Cooperative Exchange was loading an Anhydrous Ammonia tank. He was transferring NH3 from the 30,000 gallon storage tank to the 1000 gallon nurse lank. Without thinking, the employee got in the pickup and pulled forward. He had forgotten to unhook the fill hose from the tank. When he pulled away, it broke the liquid valve from the nurse tank, essentially leaving the line from the bulk storage tank open. The Anhydrous Ammonia was leaking from the one-inch fill hose into the air. The employee was able to get away from the area fine, but he was not able to get to the shut-off valve. The general manager of the facility immediately called the Bessie Fire Department. Within about 5 minutes the first fire truck showed up on the scene and began spraying water on the release. The fire department made a couple of attempts to get to the shut-off valve and turn it off, but they were unsuccessful due to the whipping of the hose. The facility is equipped with excess flow valves that are designed to prevent this situation, but the one on this line was not responding. The fire department continued to spray water on the NH3 to try to suppress the flow. We realized that the water from the FD wa3 starting to run off down the railroad track right-of-way. We immediately called in a dozer to contain the runoff water. After 3 1/2 hours of NH3 releasing the FD was finally able to get to the shut-off valve and stop the release. It was approximately 6:30 pm. No one got hurt. We began cleanup by calling in a vacuum truck to come and suck up all the water the FD had sprayed. We stored the water in a 15,000 gallon tank we have at the facility and we also rented a tank from an oilfield company. During the first 30 minutes, the Highway Patrol and Police had shut down a couple small streets in the town of Bessie. They and the FD also evacuated part of the town north of the Coop. We made calls to the LEPC, DEQ, Dept. of Ag. and the NRC to report the accident.   This entire accident could have been avoided if the employee just would have followed the company’s safety procedures that we have in our NH3 Risk Management book. He should have had the tank wheels chocked and should have checked to make sure all hoses and valves where shut off and secure before pulling away. He has had sufficient training and has been working with anhydrous ammonia at Bessie Coop for over 30 years. He just got complacent and didn’t think. In the future, we at Farmers Coop Exchange will be much more cognizant of the company safety procedures and maybe it will prevent anything like this from happening again.",,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,19200,FARMERS COOPERATIVE EXCHANGE,US,

Our driver then proceed to move into the right lane in order to stop on the shoulder, due to heavy traffic at that time he could not stop safely on the shoulder for about a mile. When he stopped he noticed that the tire was smoking.  He then took his fire extinguisher and tried to put the fire out.  Two other truckers stopped and gave him their fire extinguishers but even with the help of the other two, he was not able to extinguished the fire. Our driver then unhooked his truck from the trailer and called 911. Our driver phoned his employer and was instructed to contact the 24 Hour emergency number provided by the consignor on the Bill of Lading.  When the fire truck arrived at the scene, the fire was burning ONLY around the tires and wheels; the fire had not attacked the trailer floor or sides yet. The fire fighter sprayed water on the surrounding grass and trees. The decision was made by the Fire Marshall to let the trailer burn.  The body of the portable tank containing Sodium Hydrosulfite failed due to extreme heat caused by the fire.","The fire should have been extinguished at the time the fire truck arrived at the scene.  At that time the fire was only around the tires and wheel, not to the body of the trailer yet.  Applying water to this area in order to extinguished the fire would have been no danger, as this product was inside sealed aluminum bins.

AS Vehicle #1 traveled down the ramp it left the roadway on the north shoulder of the ramp. Vehicle #1 entered the grass and traveled 50 feet before crossing the end of the curb leaving tire marks and tire impressions in the grass and on the curb. As the driver of Vehicle #1 attempted to negotiate the right turn at the end of the ramp, tie load of jet fuel shifted to the left side of the vehicle causing it to overturn onto its left side in the middle northbound lane of GA 70. The vehicle then slid 20 feet across the remaining inside northbound lane of GA 70, striking the center median curb and rolling up onto it’s back and coming to final rest.

Shipping Operator was charged with loading a tank truck with Decoupage MNP. Decoupage MNP is a product made in an in-line blend system from Nonyl Phenol and an inhibiter. Decoupage MNP is used in decoupage applications. The truck to be loaded arrived at the 1-luntsman Corp. Conroe Site at 1700 hours to load a shipment of approximately 45,000 lbs of Decoupage MNP. The truck is owned by Heniff Transpo-tation Systems, Inc. This shpment was to be made against our order 55112818. The Shipping Operator lined up the tank and loading equipment to load. He then spotted the truck at the loading site. He performed a preshipment inspection on the truck and approved it to load. The Shipping Operator traced the 2” in diameter loading hose and connected what he thought was the correct hose to the truck. The Shipping Operator then went into the Shipping Office to start the load. The loading operation has a remote pump start in the Shipping Office area. The loading commenced at 1720 hours. At approximately 1755 hours, the Operator went to check to see how the load was progressing. He noticed that the product was flowing to the ground from a different 2” hose than the one he had connected to the truck. He immediately went to the loading site and closed a manual valve to stop the spill. He discovered that he had actually hooked te wrong hose up to the truck. A total of 32,380 lbs of product was lost. The C)perator immediately notified the Utility department who then notified the Lead Operator in Charge. Clean up began immediately. The sewer system was switched to capture the spilled material in our waste water tank and the drainage ditch in the shipping area was diked with sand to prevent material from getting into our treatment ponds. Vacuum trucks were used to remove the product from the diked areas and the product cleaned from the road and other surfaces with soap and high pressure water. All of the liquid material including the soap and water mixture was captured in our waste water tank. The waste water was then shipped off-site for disposal as a class I non-hazardous waste in a deep well. Contaminated soil was placed into three roll-off bins and shipped off-site as a class I non-hazardous waste for disposal in a land-fill. A root cause investigation was performed on 8/2/2006 and action items were developed to prevent a reoccurrence of a similar incident.","Training sessions were held with Shipping Operators to review the incident ar.d to go over good practices. The good practices reviewed included the need to keep hoses untangled so that they can be better traced it was unacceptable to pall on a tangled hose to determine its source, the need to always go back to a loading operation to immediately check to make sure that the line up was correct after starting the loading operation and when working alone, get the truck driver to assist in observing the load if the operator has to leave the area. In the discussion with operators it was emphasized that the remote start could be done against a blocked valve which was the preferred practice. Once the pump was started, the operator could return to the loading area and open the valve thus minimizing the amount spilled if the hook-up was incorrect. Future actions include reviewing whether a pump start switch could be located at the loading rack and to determine if there is some reasonable way to identify the ends of the hose as well as the manifold it is hooked to.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,46987,HUNTSMAN CORP,US,

He advised that they were boxes containing paint and that there was not a load bar that should have secured the freight on top of the load table. Upon the driver being able to get to the freight he removed them from the trailer and began to put them into a hazardous containment drum and use absorbal to clean up the spilled product on the trailer floor. The absobal and spilled paint were put into the hazardous contair ment drum with the boxes of spilled paint. 2 small pails in 2 different boxes had been punctured upon falling on the ground of trailer while in transit. During transit the paint was spread over some of the boxes and leaded onto most of the other small pails, but not onto any other freight because when they came off the load table the shrink wrap over the freight acted as a barrier between the hazardous material and other freight loaded on the trailer.","Intercompany spill report was sent and message to supervisor at loading location regarding the failure of proper loading and failure to have shipment properly signed on the trailer by loaded for follow up. Our company continually sends messages to front line managers and supervisors to ensure that our drivers loading and unloading any pails, drums, totes, or any such hazardous material be aware what they are handling and take precaution in the manner they use to load and unload the freight.

On the evening of July 28, 2006, Proflame employee was present at the facility in the ordinary course of his employment. Employee was present at the facility for the purpose of filling approximately one hundred (100) 33-pound forklift motor fuel cylinders for delivery to customers the following day.  Employee was trained and certified by reporting party’s plant operator to fill cylinders as required by Nevada Law.  Employee was dispensing liquid propane gas from a bobtail located at the facility into the forklift motor fuel cylinders. The transfer operation generally involves connecting a brass dispenser nozzle attached to the bobtail truck by a high-pressure rubber hose to the cylinder to be filled. Liquid propane gas is dispensed under pressure into the receptacle cylinder. Employee verified that each of the cylinders was not filled beyond its safe fill level by observing the quality of the gas being emitted from the fixed liquid level gauge located on each of the receptacle cylinders.  The fixed liquid level gauge consists of an aperture into the cylinder which is in turn connected to a dip tube which may be opened through a screw assembly on the gauge itself. The propane escaping through the aperture will change from clear to white as the liquid level in the cylinder reaches the bottom of the dip tube, signaling that the cylinder has been filled to maximum capacity. At that stage, the flow of gas is discontinued to the receptacle cylinder. The fixed liquid level gauge is then closed and the dispenser nozzle is disconnected.  Employee was in the process of filling, by his estimate, approximately the sixtieth of the approximately 100 cylinders at the district at the time of this incident. While filling the cylinder with the fixed liquid level gauge open, gas exiting the gauge ignited from an unknown source and flashed to the cylinder. Reporting party believes the ignition startled an employee, causing him to back away from the cylinder. It is believed that, in that process, the cylinder fell on its side, putting the dip tube attached to the fixed liquid level gauge into the liquid space in the cylinder and allowing liquid propane gas to exit through the oriface. Reporting party believes that ignited gas from the fixed liquid level gauge applied heat to a number of nearby filled aluminum forklift cylinders, causing the safety relief valves installed in each of the cylinders (as required by law) to open, releasing more gas into the atmosphere which was in turn ignited.  Reporting party believes that the fire caused a number of the aluminum cylinders to fail. The fire and failing cylinders caused a number of other cylinders, a bulk storage tank at the premises, as well as at least one storage tank on a bobtail at an adjacent facility operated by Amen gas, to fail.  Reporting","Immediately after this incident occurred, this reporting party arranged for several experts to travel to the scene in an attempt to determine the cause or causes of the incident. Reporting party also fully cooperated with the various federal, state and local agencies involved in the investigation of the incident.  To date, all of the evidence indicates that vaporized propane gas being emitted from the fixed liquid level gauge on the forklift motor fuel cylinder being filled by reporting party's employee,ignited at an unknown source. All of the evidence indicates that this initial ignition set off a chain reaction of events resulting in a large fire and the rupturing of a number of cylinders and two bulk storage tanks.  Reporting party has devoted a great deal of resources to attempting to gain as full an understanding of the cause or causes of this incident as possible. In that regard, the evidence discovered to date indicates that employee was following company procedure and acting in accordance with his training in all respects meaningful to the occurrence of the incident in transfering liquid propane gas into the cylinder being filled.  Reporting party has not discovered any evidence which indicates that there was an unintended release of propane gas or a failure of any equipment which in any way caused or contributed to the incident.  Lastly, reporting party has not discovered any evidence or information which suggests a source of the initial ignition, notwithstanding an exhausting investigation, witness interviews, review of all available physical evidence and consultation with the appropriate federal, state and local authorities.

On the evening of July 28, 2006, Proflame employee was present at the facility in the ordinary course of his employment. Employee was present at the facility for the purpose of filling approximately one hundred (100) 33-pound forklift motor fuel cylinders for delivery to customers the following day.  Employee was trained and certified by reporting party’s plant operator to fill cylinders as required by Nevada Law.  Employee was dispensing liquid propane gas from a bobtail located at the facility into the forklift motor fuel cylinders. The transfer operation generally involves connecting a brass dispenser nozzle attached to the bobtail truck by a high-pressure rubber hose to the cylinder to be filled. Liquid propane gas is dispensed under pressure into the receptacle cylinder. Employee verified that each of the cylinders was not filled beyond its safe fill level by observing the quality of the gas being emitted from the fixed liquid level gauge located on each of the receptacle cylinders.  The fixed liquid level gauge consists of an aperture into the cylinder which is in turn connected to a dip tube which may be opened through a screw assembly on the gauge itself. The propane escaping through the aperture will change from clear to white as the liquid level in the cylinder reaches the bottom of the dip tube, signaling that the cylinder has been filled to maximum capacity. At that stage, the flow of gas is discontinued to the receptacle cylinder. The fixed liquid level gauge is then closed and the dispenser nozzle is disconnected.  Employee was in the process of filling, by his estimate, approximately the sixtieth of the approximately 100 cylinders at the district at the time of this incident. While filling the cylinder with the fixed liquid level gauge open, gas exiting the gauge ignited from an unknown source and flashed to the cylinder. Reporting party believes the ignition startled an employee, causing him to back away from the cylinder. It is believed that, in that process, the cylinder fell on its side, putting the dip tube attached to the fixed liquid level gauge into the liquid space in the cylinder and allowing liquid propane gas to exit through the oriface. Reporting party believes that ignited gas from the fixed liquid level gauge applied heat to a number of nearby filled aluminum forklift cylinders, causing the safety relief valves installed in each of the cylinders (as required by law) to open, releasing more gas into the atmosphere which was in turn ignited.  Reporting party believes that the fire caused a number of the aluminum cylinders to fail. The fire and failing cylinders caused a number of other cylinders, a bulk storage tank at the premises, as well as at least one storage tank on a bobtail at an adjacent facility operated by Amen gas, to fail.  Reporting","Immediately after this incident occurred, this reporting party arranged for several experts to travel to the scene in an attempt to determine the cause or causes of the incident. Reporting party also fully cooperated with the various federal, state and local agencies involved in the investigation of the incident.  To date, all of the evidence indicates that vaporized propane gas being emitted from the fixed liquid level gauge on the forklift motor fuel cylinder being filled by reporting party's employee,ignited at an unknown source. All of the evidence indicates that this initial ignition set off a chain reaction of events resulting in a large fire and the rupturing of a number of cylinders and two bulk storage tanks.  Reporting party has devoted a great deal of resources to attempting to gain as full an understanding of the cause or causes of this incident as possible. In that regard, the evidence discovered to date indicates that employee was following company procedure and acting in accordance with his training in all respects meaningful to the occurrence of the incident in transfering liquid propane gas into the cylinder being filled.  Reporting party has not discovered any evidence which indicates that there was an unintended release of propane gas or a failure of any equipment which in any way caused or contributed to the incident.  Lastly, reporting party has not discovered any evidence or information which suggests a source of the initial ignition, notwithstanding an exhausting investigation, witness interviews, review of all available physical evidence and consultation with the appropriate federal, state and local authorities.

Unit 315- 4072 had a substance leaking from the front of it and since I knew the driver was carrying Hazardous Materials, I immediately had him put the trailer up to the dock. The driver backed the trailer to the dock and i opened the door to see that a tote of Ferrous Chloride was leaking. I walked to the tote ad noticed it was cracked on top and as the trailer was moving, the liquid was gradually splashing through the crack. I inspected the tote and it looked to be weather worn. Realizing this was a Hazardous Materials spill, I contacted my Safety Manager and the manager of the Bakersfield Service Center. I was told to leave the material in the trailer it had arrived in along with the other freight that was already loaded in the trailer because as long as the unit was not moving, the material would not leak out. The trailer was parked and the leaking stopped because the liquid was no longer “sloshing” in the tote.",,No,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,
