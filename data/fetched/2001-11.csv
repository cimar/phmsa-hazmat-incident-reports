THE WASTE WAS TO BE PLACED IN STORAGE AND THEN ADDED TO ADDITIONAL WASTE BOUND FOR ENSCO'S TREATMENT FACILITY IN EL DORADO AR ON WEDNESDAY, 11/28/01. ON TUESDAY EVENING, 11/27/01, MARK MILLER RECEIVED A CALL FROM JEFF KUBISAK, DIRECTOR OF FIELD SERVICES, STATING THE SHIPMENT WAS BEING LOADED TO GO TO ENSCO, HOWEVER IT WAS MISSING A DRUM, NUMBER SNLA012043 WHICH CONTAINED A SMALL PIECE OF COAL, CLASSED AS A FLAMMABLE SOLID. JEFF AND A NUMBER OF FIELD SERVICE EMPLOYEES HAD GONE THROUGH THE WEST WAREHOUSE LOOKING FOR THE DRUM AND WERE UNABLE TO FIND IT. MARK MILLER DROVE TO THE WEST WAREHOUSE TO HELP LOOK FOR THE MISSING CONTAINER AND IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE DRUM WAS NOT IN THE FACILITY AND MAY HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO A DIFFERENT TREATMENT FACILITY. HOWEVER UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, WE NOTICED THE PALLET, WHICH SHOULD HAVE CONTAINED THE DRUM IN QUESTION, WAS NOT ADEQUATELY SHRINK-WRAPPED, AND THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT HAD FALLEN OFF OF THE SHIPMENT WHEN IT WAS INITIALLY TRANSPORTED.  THE WEST WAREHOUSE HAS A STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE(PAIS FORM) IN PLACE FOR RECEIVING WASTE THAT SHOULD HAVE ALERTED OUR DRIVER THAT A DRUM WAS MISSING THAT SAME DAY. HOWEVER, THIS PROCEDURE WAS NOT FOLLOWED AND THE DRUM COUNT WAS NOT VERIFIED UNTIL ONE WEEK LATER.  WITH THIS INFORMATION MISSING IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW IF IT FELL OFF THE INITIAL SHIPMENT OR IF IT HAD BEEN MISTAKENLY PULLED FROM THE PALLET AND SHIPPED TO ANOTHER FACILITY. WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEE KENNY SANCHEZ AND MARK MILLER DROVE THE ROUTE OF THE INITIAL SHIPMENT FROM SANDIA NATIONAL LABS TO RINCHEM A COUPLE OF TIMES EACH ON TUESDAY NIGHT, 11/27/01, IN HOPES OF FINDING THE MISSING CONTAINER. ON WEDNESDAY MORNING 11/28/01, MARK MILLER RE-TRACED THE SHIPMENT ROUTE, ABOUT 7:00 AM TO 7:30 AM, IN HOPES OF FINDING THE MISSING CONTAINER, BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS. JOAQUIN FLORES, THE DRIVER OF THE ORIGINAL SHIPMENT, FOLLOWED THE PATH THAT HE HAD ORIGINALLY TAKEN  IN HOPES OF FINDING THE CONTAINER AS WELL.  WE THEN RETURNED TO RINCHEM'S WEST WAREHOUSE AT ABOUT 7:45 AM AND LOOKED AGAIN THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY FOR THE MISSING DRUM. THE TREATMENT FACILITIES THAT THE MISSING DRUM COULD HAVE MISTAKENLY SHIPPED TO WERE CONTACTED AND VERIFIED THAT THEY HAD NOT RECEIVED THE DRUM.  AT THIS POINT, 8:15 AM, MARK MILLER MARKED THE DRUM OFF THE MANIFEST AND ALL ADDITIONAL PAPERWORK FOR THE SHIPMENT SO THAT THE TRUCK COULD LEAVE ON TIME AND MEET ITS SCHEDULED DROP DATE AT ENSCO. WE CONTINUED THE SEARCH ABOUT 9:00 AM BY CREATING TEAMS TO SEARCH THE ROADSIDES FROM THE SANDIA FACILITY TO RINCHEM'S WEST WAREHOUSE, BUT WERE UNABLE TO FIND EVEN A TRACE OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MISSING CONTAINER. THE TEAMS WERE SENT BACK TO THE FACILITY ABOUT 12:30 PM AND THE SEARCH WAS TERMINATED.

ENSCO WILMINGTON  IS A RCRA PERMITTED TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITY, LOCATED AT 1737 EAST DENNI STREET, WILMINGTON,  CA 90744 (EPA #: CAD 044 429 835). SEVERAL ENSCO EMPLOYEES WHO WERE ON BREAK IN THE LUNCHROOM AT THE TIME HEARD THE NOISE( SEE MAP). VAPOR WAS SEEN COMING FROM A TRAILER STAGED AT THE LOADING/ UNLOADING DOCK.  THE TRAILER'S CONTENT CONSISTED OF A CONSOLIDATED LOAD OF 10-DAY TRANSFER MATERIAL, WHICH INCLUDED WASTE TRANSPORTED TO THE FACILITY BY ENSCO'S TRANSPORTATION FLEET, THAT OPERATES UNDER THE DBA DIVISION TRANSPORT(EPA#: ARD 069 748 192).  THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 30 CONTAINERS ON THE TRUCK AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. THE SUSPECTED CONTAINER WAS IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED AS BEING A CAUSTIC WASTE THAT SOME HOW OVER PRESSURIZED, CAUSING THE TOP OF AN OPEN-TOP 55- GALLON FIBER (POLY) DRUM TO POP OFF (SEE MANIFEST AR1188246 LINE 11B.) THE PRESSURE WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO CAUSE APPROXIMATELY 20 GALLONS OF THE MATERIAL INSIDE OF THE DRUM TO SPEW ONTO THE CEILING, WALLS AND FLOOR OF THE TRAILER.  AN INDUSTRIAL FAN WAS USED TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS OF VENTING THE TRAILER TO INCREASE VISIBILITY. ENSCO Wilmington EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY DONNED LEVEL-B PPE AND ENTERED THE TRAILER. ER PERSONNEL LOCATED THE DRUM, WHICH WAS MISSING ITS LID. THE LID WAS PLACED ONTO THE CONTAINER AND IT ALONG WITH THREE OTHERS MANIFESTED ON THE SAME LINE ITEM WERE PALLETIZED (SEE PICTURE) AND PLACED INTO THE REPACKAGING AREA ""D"" OF THE ENSCO Wilmington WASTE STORAGE WAREHOUSE (SEE MAP). THIS AREA IS EQUIPPED WITH FUME HOODS, DESIGNATED FOR VENTING DRUMS. ONCE THE DRUMS WERE REMOVED, ER PERSONNEL PROCEEDED TO DECONTAMINATE THE TRAILER AND REMAINING CONTAINERS (SEE PICTURES). RAGS WERE USED TO REMOVE SPILLED MATERIAL FROM THE TRAILER'S CEILING, WALLS AND REMAINING CONTAINERS. THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER WAS CLEANED WITH PRESSURIZED STREAM, WITH THE LIQUID RUN-OFF BEING PLACED INTO DRUMS AND MANAGED AS HAZARDOUS WASTE.  THE WASTE PROFILE OF THE CAUSTIC MATERIAL WAS RETRIEVED AND DID NOT GIVE ANY INDICATION OF REACTIVE CONSTITUENTS THAT WOULD CAUSE PRESSURE TO BUILD SO FORCEFULLY INSIDE OF A DRUM.  A CALL WAS THEN PLACED TO THE GENERATOR CONTACT LISTED ON THE MANIFEST. THE CONTACT DETERMINED THE POSSIBLE SCENARIO THAT CAUSED INCOMPATIBLE CONSTITUENTS TO BE PLACED INTO THIS PARTICULAR CONTAINER. HE INDICATED THAT THE WASTE SHOULD HAVE CONTAINED ARSENIC, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND SODIUM HYDROXIDE. ANOTHER WASTE STREAM THAT IS GENERATED IN THAT SAME AREA CONTAINED ARSENIC DUST, SEDIMENT, HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND CAUSTIC. HE STATED THAT PRIOR TO SHIPPING THE LATTER STREAM, HE WOULD USUALLY TREAT IT IN A MANNER CAUSING A NON-EXOTHERMIC REACTION, RESULTING IN MATERIAL THAT IS STABILIZED FOR SHIPMENT.

NINETY-THREE PERCENT SULFURIC ACID IS AVAILABLE FOR SALE TO INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL CLIENTS WITH DELIVERY VIA MOTOR CARRIER AND RAIL TANK CARS. CHALUM INDUSTRY, THE CONSIGNEE, AT SACATON, AZ, 88 MILES FROM HAYDEN, USES SULFURIC ACID TO MAKE ALUMINUM SULFATE (ALUM) FOR WATER TREATMENT IN PHOENIX, AZ.  THE CARRIER USED 3,500 GALLON, MC 412, CARGO TANKS, 41 FEET OVERALL LENGTH WITH A 20 INCH TYONA BETTS FILLER DOME LOCATED 12 FEET FORWARD OF THE REAR OF THE TANK.  THE FILLER DOME LID HAS A 3/4"" X 3/4"" HYPOLON GASKET THAT MATES WITH THE 20"" DIAMETER 1/4"" THICK RISER AT THE TOP OF THE VESSEL.  THE DOME LID IS ASME AND IS SECURED WITH SIX SCREW-DOWN DOGS.  ALSO IN THE SPILL DAM, ROLLOVER PROTECTED FILLER DOME AREA, IS A 1"" AIR INLET PIPE WITH 1"" STAINLESS BALL VALVE AND CAPPED CHICAGO AIR COUPLER. THE DRIVER, JOHN D. ALLISON, SSN:600-01-6043, ARRIVED AT THE ASARCO ACID PLANT AND WEIGHED THE TRACTOR-TRAILER EMPTY OR TARE WEIGHT.  HE THEN WENT BACK INTO THE LOADING RACK WHICH HAS A BACKWARD PLATFORM.  THIS ONE MATES WITH THE LEFT OR STREET SIDE OF THE MC412 WHILE THE DRIVER WORK PLATFORM IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE.  ONCE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED, CHALKED, AND THE BRAKES WERE SET, THE DRIVER PUT ON FULL PERSONAL PROTECTIVE GEAR, OPENED THE FILLER DOME LID, INSERTED THE LOADING SPOUT, AND PLACED A COMPANY SUPPLIED METAL STRAP WITH A U-SHAPED UPPER END OVER THE 1/4"" RISER OF THE TANK. THIS METAL STRAP IS 1"" WIDE BY 1/16"" THICK AND IS USED AS A LOADING MARKER IN THE 3,500 GALLON VESSEL.  ASARCO WOULD NOT ALLOW TRUCKS TO LEAVE WITH A GROSS THAT EXCEEDED 80,000 POUNDS SO THE PORTABLE LOADING MARKER HAS LIQUID LEVEL INDICATORS FOR ALL THE ACID PLANTS WHERE WE LOADED.  THE DRIVER THEN OPENED VALVES AND STARTED THE PUMP TO DELIVER THE DESIRED LIQUID LEVEL ON THE MARKER.  WHEN LOADED, HE STOPPED THE PUMP TO DELIVER THE DESIRED LIQUID LEVEL ON THE MARKER.  WHEN LOADED, HE STOPPED THE PUMP, CLOSED THE VALVES, FAILED TO REMOVE THE U-SHAPED MARKER STICK, CLOSED AND SECURED THE DOME LID AND CHECKED TO INSURE THE 1"" BALL VALVE (AIR INLET) WAS CLOSED.  HE THEN RE-WEIGHED FOR HIS GROSS WEIGHT AND PROCEEDED TO THE SECURITY OFFICE FOR BILLS OF LADING.  A FINAL CHECK OF THE LOWER AND UPPER OPENINGS OF THE TRANSPORT WAS MADE AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN MOVED AND AN UNSECURED OPENING SHOULD SHOW EVIDENCE OF RELEASE OR LEAK PRIOR TO LEAVING THE SHIPPER'S PROPERTY.  ASARCO LOADS MANY CARRIERS IN A 24 HOUR PERIOD AND SOME LOADS GO NORTH ON AZ 177, THE 31  MILES TO SUPERIOR, AZ, AND U.S. HIGHWAY 60. AZ 177 RUNS THROUGH THE LINES THAT REQUIRE HAZ MAT TRUCKS TO STOP BOTH LOADED AND EMPTY.  IN ADDITION TO THE RAILROAD TRACK STOPS, THE ROUTE HAS SEVERAL LONG MOUNTAINOUS UP-HILL GRADES.  THE FIRST STARTS AT MP 152.8 AND RUNS FOR TWO MILES UP HILL AT A 7% GRADE.  THE NEXT IS A MORE SEVERE 10% GRADE AND IT STARTS AT ABOUT 158.0 AND RUNS TO MP 161.0, ABOUT 6 MILES SOUTH OF SUPERIOR.
