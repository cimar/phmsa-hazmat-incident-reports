It appeared to be coming from the dome area of each car. Upon further inspection, it was identified as diesel. The UP Hazmat Team were deployed, as were Viva Environmental, to neutralize the situation. Western representatives arrived at the scene at 9pm. Upon inspection of the cars, it was readily obvious that the dome bolts were not properly secured prior to release. The Hazmat Team found 6 loose bolts on ACFX 79300 and 5 loose bolts on ACFX 86869 (they were a little more than ""hand tight""). The gaskets were found to be worn, but not to the point where they would not properly seal had the bolts been properly tightened. The gaskets were replaced as a precaution, the bolts were secured, and the cars were released at approx 10pm.  No diesel spillage reached the ground. The estimated amount on the side of the car was less than a gallon.

PATRICK KELLEY,SAFETY SPECIALIST,,,,,Carrier,In removing the tote from the trailer the fork truck was at the point of leveling into the trailer at the same time that the forks were entering the cage surrounding the plastic gaylord. As everything shifted the metal guard that protects the valve at the bottom of the tote collapsed into the plastic neck of the valve. The fitting cracked at the junction with the tote. Liquid began to leak out and the fork lift operator continued to lift the tote out of the trailer and back out of the tail of the trailer onto the dock. He then enlisted help and they turned the tole over so that the broken valve was on its side above the level of the liquid. At this point I believe that with the tote on its side near the dock door there was an un noticed slow leak from a small hole near the top of the tote that allowed the majority of the liquid to leak onto the ground outside the dock door. Once this was noticed the tote was turned again to stop that leakage. The tote leaked approximately 190-gallons of the original 200-gallons. A hazmat contractor was hired to clean up the spill which included removal of contaminated gravel and soil next to the dock and under the trailer. The contaminated material will be disposed of properly.,First order of business is corrective action to all employees involved concerning this incident not being reported immediately when it occurred. This is not acceptable and could easily become a more serious accident if the chemical involved were a more toxic item. I need to re-educate all employees   at 198 in the mandatory procedures in place for this type of incident. Secondly is a review with all involved in noting the integrity of the containers we pickup from this shipper. The next order of business is to review our handling procedures to prevent this type of fork lift damage in the future.,Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,3300,,,

BORTHWICK,PORTLAND,OR,97227,Shipper,"On December 5, 2007 at approximately 12:10 PM, we had an on-site release of approximately 22 gallons NPA.  Our employee inadvertently left one external valve open on the trailer he was intending to load the product into.  When he started to pump the product, he knew that he had forgotten to close the left side valve and within seconds he had shut down the engine cutting off the flow of product.  Consequently, 22 gallons of NPA was pumped onto the asphalt.  The product began to run down the alley way toward the NW corner of our site.  The driver ran to the NW corner, arriving before the product and immediately placed absorbent material and booms to contain the product and dike the sump.  While he was able to prevent most of the product from entering the sump and separator, it is estimated that about 10 gallons got past the absorbent materials into the oil/water separator.  Other employees joined the driver to put additional absorbent materials around the sump and oil/water separator to prevent further leakage.  They then cleaned up the NPA that had been collected within the various absorbent materials and put them into the appropriate containers for disposal. When the oil/water separator was opened, it was noted that the water level was below the outfall pipe.  Therefore, none of the product actually left the site.  The product/water mix within the separator was pumped out by approximately 3:45 PM into three tote bins.  An outside contractor then came in; pressure washed and cleaned the oil/water separator.  Samples from the totes were obtained for analysis to help determine proper disposal.  The outside contractor was on-site from approximately 4:00 PM to 5:15 PM.  This work was completed on 12/5/07.  More samples were taken of each tote on 12/21/07.  When we receive the analysis of the material we will profile the material for proper off-site disposal.",We have instituted the following measures to help prevent any reoccurrence of this incident:  1.  Reviewed our standard operating procedures.    2.  Loading and unloading procedures were reviewed with the driver.  3.  Discussed the incident in the Dec. safety committee.  4.  Remind employees to think first and double check their work.  5.  Lids on the spill containment drums have been loosened so that only a quarter turn is necessary to remove the screw tops for quicker access to spill containment materials.  We intend to install a shut off valve to prevent future potential off-site releases if the configuration and size of the oil/water separator will allow it.,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC306,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,TARR INC,,

Upon identification of the damaged container, it was determined that a 55 gallon steel drum had developed a pinhole leak.  During transportation, the  load movement allowed the liquid to escape.

I looked at the car and found that the car had a minor leak on the air inlet valve at the flange. I placed a receptacle below the leak and informed the yard office that track 17 would be shut down until further notice. I contacted Chemtrec and reported the incident and they informed ExxonMobil of thesituation and they contacted me to let me know they had contacted SWS First Response Co. SWS arrived at aproximately 2300. They discovered product on the top unloading plate under the liquid and air flanges. The liqud air flange was unbolted and raised enough to dry underneath the flange to vizualize its codition.The air flange was then unbolted. the nuts holding the flange wee not sufficently tight. the flange was raised revealing a deformed gasket. The gasket was replaced and bolts were tightened.The spliiage on the outside of the car was wiped down.

While traveling on Highway 36 just north of Lyons, Texas, vehicle was involved in an accident which punctured the cargo tank.  Approximately 20,000 liquid pounds of free product were released.  The Somerville Fire Department responded to assess the site, along with the Texas Highway Patrol, and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  R&D Environmental Services of Channelview, Texas was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  R&D Environmental Services applied absorbent material and saw dust to the affected roadway, and scraped the minimal soil along the road shoulder.  R&D Environmental Services proceeded to use a vacuum truck to recover the free product and water from the affected creek.  Eleven (11) 55-gallon drums of spent absorbent material, sawdust, and soil were transported to R&D Environmental Services’ facility pending disposal.  Approximately 250,000 gallons of contaminated water were pumped from the affected creek.  Analytical samples were taken and submitted to the lab to confirm all levels of contamination had been removed.  There were no injuries or exposures reported as a result of the release.","Since the release was due to a vehicle accident, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder immediately inspected GATX 3917 finding a small amount of liquid product around the 75 psi pressure relief device (PRD). The responder covered the PRD with plastic and sealed it with duct tape. The spillage was cleaned with a bleach/water solution. GATX 3917 was carefully isolated in the railyard awaiting replacement of the PRD that possibly malfunctioned. After the replacement PRD was received, a GATX technician installed it the morning of 1/08/08 and GATX 3917 was released to proceed to its destination 1/08/08 at 1015 hrs PST. The technician indicated the PRD removed appeared to be 'gummed-up' and it was forwarded to a GATX valve shop for a detailed inspection and failure analysis.  Four BNSF employees that were working nearby GATX 3917 at the start of this incident reported product odor exposure.

JBK unit was struck in the rearby another semi operated by Zeeland Farm Services, Zeeland, Ml. There were no leaks at the time of the accident. Ittook several hours to extract the driver of the second vehicle, approximately 6 hours later the JBK cargo tankdeveloped a leak. The cargo could not be transferred due to the second vehicle being imbedded into the rear of theJBK unit. The decision was made by the incident commander that due to the flammable conditions the cargo tankwould be allowed to leak until all liquid was dissipated. The LNG was allowed to dissipate into the atmosphere. Thescene was secured and numerous emergency vehicles from the fire department remained in attendance. The cargotank stopped leaking at approximately 2:00 PM the next day. The incident commander decided to let the cargo tankstabilize throughout the night. At 07:30 the next morning the cargo tank was purged with Nitrogen, Compressed gas.The JBK and Zeeland units were separated shortly there after and removed from the scene. The cargo tank wastowed to Alloy Custom products in Delphi, In for evaluation.We have received the following written report from AlloyCustom Products describing the cargo tank failure. We have completed the investigation of damages to Unit E073( Serial Number V3632 ) and the damages as a result of the accident that occurred on US 31 nearPlymouthlN. Wehave determined that the liquid natural gas leaked from a crack in the inner vessel shell that was a result of thecollision. The impact force that was imparted upon the rear of the trailer buckled the jacket and caused the reartandem sub frame to translocate forward and upward at the front of the sub frame.","In our opinion and that of the cargo tank manufacturer, the cargo tank held up extremely well under thecircumstances. The cargo tank sustained a massive blow to the rear of the trailer caused by another semi striking therear at approximately 60 MPH. FMCSA regulations require vehicles transporting hazardous materials to stop atrailroad crossings. In this case there is not a pull out area for the vehicle to stop and the stop must be done in theroadway. Our opinion is that rail road crossings should be exempt if they are protected by crossing gates and/orlights.",Yes,TANK CRYO,Cargo tanks for cryogenic liquids,MC338,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,203469,"JACK B KELLEY, INC.",US,

Shipment was loaded on an air cargo pallet and being unloaded in the cargo facility for Worldwide Flight Services at IAD. Shipment was one of two shipments on the air pallet - I PC was IO67kilos, the other was 1PC/1KILO. The first shipment to be removed from the pallet was the one piece at 1 O67kilos. The item was large and bulky and the forklift operator did not see the other shipment as it was pulled under the shipment that was being unloaded. The driver proceeded to drive over to the dangerous goods area (as both shipments were DG) and unknowingly dragged the box all the way to the haz mat area. The item was not able to be located by the warehouse staff and when a search was initiated for the missing box, it was located in the haz mat area. The consignment was found in a damaged state and the area was immediately evacuated until the contents could be verified. The box was damaged/crushed, however, there was no visible spillage. The DG declaration was located which stated what the item was inside the box. The Emergency Response book was immediately checked for clarification on handling the incident. The incident was reported to the local emergency response team and they were dispatched. The incident team arrived on the scene and was given all of the necessary paperwork for their evaluation. The responders determined the item to be of low to moderate hazard as per the ERG and stated that we needed to give the item an over pack. It was agreed and supervised by Fireman Harris to use a secure 5 gallon pail with locking lid. The item was placed in the pail and secured. New DG Class 9 labels were placed on the outside of the bucket and paperwork was attached as well. Item was re secured in the DG area of the warehouse and the response team left. Response team was here approximately 42mm. in total.",Improper forklift procedures lead to this incident. The driver will need to be retrained on proper procedures as well asULD build and break procedures.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,AIR FREIGHT LANE,US,

After the waste acid was loaded in the truck, the driver was instructed by a Mold Tech [Generator] employee to clean the acid solution from the inside of his loading hoses by vacuuming water from an adjacent tank, through the hoses into the cargo tank, where the water mixed with the concentrated acid. GEodynamic believes that such a mixture resulted in a highly exothermic reaction, and under such temperatures and conditions, the reacting acid solution attacked even the acid resistant surfaces of the interior of the cargo tank, and the corrosion-resistant valve assembly used to fill and empty the tank. It seems apparent from the post incident condition of the valve assembly, that such acid attack of the metal occurred, resulting in a leak. Geodynamic’s truck left the Mold Tech facility at about 3:15 PM; at that time, although the reaction was presumably taking place inside the tank, there were no outwardly visible signs. The truck had only proceeded approximately a mile from the facility when leakage was observed from the valve assembly at the rear of the truck. Geodynamic’s driver moved the truck to the closest available area isolated from residential areas or nearby structures, and called emergency services (911), which responded promptly. As a safety precaution, employees at two nearby businesses (Champion Steel and Cadence Innovation) were sent home early that day.","Customer-Generators have been instructed to provide accurate information on characteristics of waste shipments, including incompatibility information",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,52000,GEODYNAMIC INDUSTRIES,US,

The driver was wearing a face shield but not mono-goggles. Liquid from the ruptured hose caused the drivers hard hat and face shield to come off resulting in bums to the drivers face and eyes.      DRIVER HAD 2 STOPS INSIDE THE PLANT.  HE UNLOADED APX 900 GALLONS AT 1ST STOP HE KEPT PRESSURE ON TANK AND WENT TO 2ND STOP.

DRIVER IS A CONTRACTOR & NOT AN EMPLOYEE.  COMPANY PROVIDES TRAILER ONLY.,"Delivery drivers should review their unloading procedures with the Calpine employee supervising the unloading to ensure both parties have an awareness of unloading process. Typical unloading procedures from sulfuric manufacturers recommend that the delivery truck’s cargo vessel have pressure gradually applied to the delivery tank after establishing flow through the transfer system. If the driver’s procedure is not consistent with this, additional measures should be taken which contemplate a high velocity release.  Pre-transfer inspections of transfer hoses should include focus on potential stress points such as (onnections which cause the hose to make a 90 degree angle turn Hose connections having 45 degree angle fittings directed downward and physical support will reduce stress on the hose under the weight of the product and reduce the failure potential during liquid transfer.

Driver tried to plug the leak and it grew a little larger. We dispatched a clean lined trailer to the scene to transfer the load and stop the leak. We took an air activated diaphragm pump to the site. We transferred the product and stopped the leak at @ 07:25. Our response team from NRC Environmental covered the area with acid neutralizer. The state patrol released the driver and trailer to return to the yard and released the other trailer to deliver the load. NRC Environmental added soda ash to the collection pond & parking lot to neutralize. Neutralized wash-down water was collected and removed for disposal.
