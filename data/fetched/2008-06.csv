I dispatched a man to go inspect the unit to check the wash out caps as well as the dome lid to make sure they all were secured.       A small part of the dome gasket around the dome lid that is attached to the lid in this case was hanging  down into the trailer creating a void around the dome lid.  The seals were broken and the gasket was repaired then the trailer was returned to the ETC terminal to have an external wash to eliminate any lingering odor.

At the time of the pick-up, the container was inspected and no evidence of leaking was observed nor was there evidence of residual liquid in the container.  Approximately 5 miles away from the pick-up location, the driver noticed a small amount of material leaking from the side of the container.  The driver immediately moved his vehicle off the traveled portion of the roadway and inspected the container.  The driver identified a small crack had developed in the side of the container allowing a small amount of material to escape from the box. It is believed that residual liquid not visible at the time of pick-up separated from the solid material and was able to escape from the crack discovered by the driver. Once secured, the driver contacted his home dispatcher to report the incident.  Calls were immediately placed to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Louisiana State Police.  Upon arrival at the scene, it was decided that a local emergency response contractor be contracted to place a temporary patch on the box and clean up the estimated 2 solid gallons of material that escaped onto the side of the truck and the roadway.  This was done and all clean-up debris was added to the container for continuing transportation.  Once the clean-up was complete and the box was patched, the clean-up contractor escorted the vehicle back to the shipper’s location where the load was transferred into an alternate container for continued transportation.","Upon arrival at the shipper's location, the driver inspected the container and did not identify any evidence of material leaking or damage to the structural integity of the container.

He also noted a clear wave-like vapor from the side of the protective housing on top of the car.  This car was pulled from the shipper, Sunoco Inc., Marcus Hook, PA, by Stoney Creek crew YPSC33, on 6/19/08, at approximately 645pm.    Further inspection by Union Tank Car Inspector, Sunoco, and representatives of REACT Environmental (contracted by shipper, Sunoco) found the vapor valve closure plug not applied and same valve slightly opened.  Valve was secured and plug resecured tool tight, securing the leak.  Also noted one of the liquid valve closure plugs was not applied.  Resecured during this inspection.    During inspection of all other fittings inside the housing, found a very slight vapor leak originating from the area where the threaded pipe nipple for the Sample Line Valve threads into the pressure plate.  As car was in residue status, car will be returned to the Sunoco facility from where it originated, at which time the car will be depressurized and shopped for repair of the Sample Line.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,Pressure,112J,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Consolidated Rail Corporation,US,

Two boxes of detonating cord (UN0289) fell out of the back of a pickup truck as it was traveling between Clarksburg, WV and Weston, WV. The boxes were contained within an enclosure in the covered bed of the vehicle, the tailgate acted as the fourth wall of the enclosure.  The tailgate opened in transit allowing the boxes to drop out of the vehicle.  Once the loss was discovered, the police and ATF in Clarksburg, WV became involved. A police report was filed in Clarksburg, WV and a loss report was filed with ATF's US Bomb Data Center. A nine person search team searched the entire route by foot and car on 6/17 and a four person search team (third party) searched the route on 6/18.      Both boxes were recovered by private citizens on 6/17 and 6/18; both still contained the product, no damage occurred to the packaging.","Operating procedures have been improved to prevent the possibility of recurrence.  This includes the use of cargo stabilization bars which ratchet into place to securely stabilize the load, use of a tailgate net as a secondary securement device and a lock has been added to the tailgate which is to be locked each time the tailgate is closed.",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Titan Specialties, Ltd.",US,

Part of this pick up was two tri-wall cubic yard boxes containing Metal Hydroxide Sludge, Class 9 Misc. (Tri-wall is a large cubic yard cardboard box with a heavy duty black plastic bag inside the box.  The box is nailed to a wooden pallet and the bag, which is considered the inner packing, will hold the waste solids.)  This particular waste was scheduled to ship out of Univar 10 day waste storage on Friday June 20, 2008, going to US Ecology Beatty in Beatty, NV.  Univar material handler, Jeff Fitzgerald, was preparing a truckload of waste for an outbound shipment.  Jeff, using a forklift, lifted the tri-wall and Lead Material Handler, Mike Flores, saw some liquid leaking from the box as he lifted it.  The box was set onto a another containment pallet for further observation.  The box was leaking liquid out of two corners and there was approximately 2-3 ounces of liquid at most.  The liquid that leaked out was tested for ph and was determined to be neutral (PH of seven).   After a few phone calls B.O.S., Greg Walker, decided to called third party company (CTI) to repack the leaking container.    Tri-wall was repackaged; all contents were placed in a new tri-wall and labels were affixed, box sealed and prepped for shipment.",Not sure that any changes in the process would have eliminated this container from leaking.  Since it was the inner packaging that leaked it was not officially determined how or where it failed.  The inner packaging (plastic bag) needs to be inspected for defects and or holes prior to placing the bag into the fiberboard outer packaging. Any impacts to the inner packaging could compromise the integrity of the entire packaging.,No,IBC,"Fiberboard, for solids",11G,Yes,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,500,Univar USA Inc.,US,

This trailer was a full load of 6 totes and 12 drums with various chemicals including hazardous materials and non-regulated materials. It appears the bottom of 1 tote of a hazardous material   collapsed and the pressure blew center cap off (bung) of the tote. This allowed the liquid to spray upwards onto the roof, walls and floor of trailer. A hazmat team was called and responded to the terminal. They transferred the product out of the tote to drums and cleaned and neutralized the traile  r and empty tote.","The condition of the metal cage around the plastic tote had certainly failed prior to arrival at our Lubbock terminal. The pictures indicate rust and fatigue of the metal structure surrounding the plastic tote. The rust and fatigue was particularly bad on one bottom corner of the metal structure. Wh  en it collapsed, it allowed the inner plastic tote to shift downwards in the metal cage putting pressure onto the plastic tote. This is most likely what caused the bung to blow out of the larger cap allowing the liquid to spray upwards out of the tote.

It was reported to be a slow steady stream.      Further inspection by CR Risk Mgmt. Dept. A. Richter and REACT (environmental emergency response contractor) R. Gould, found the liquid eduction pipe closure cap less than hand tight, allowing product to exit the car, only leaking down the left side of the car (although staining on right side indicated a former leak as well).  A poly trough was placed under the left side of the car to capture/contain spilled material.  The cap was tightened and leak secured; and cars' vapor pressure slowly vented down.  Cap secured tool tight.  Phone conversations with DuPont emergency response personnel confirmed closure cap-to-pipe connection was a metal to metal seat and did not require a gasket or o-ring.  Sides of car were wiped down with chemical absorbant pads.      Area underneath car was treated with lime to neutralize.  Car moved to Pavonia Yard Car Shop for better access to clean/decon car on Tuesday, 7/1/08, and forward car to original destination.  Estimated 1 gallon of product loss at time of incident.  Representatives of NJ DEP and Camden Count Health, Environmental and Hazmat also on scene, as well as Camden City Fire Department Shift officer.    Also noted; placards displayed on the car at time of inspection noted to bear the identification numbers ""1830"", conflicting with the identification number displayed on the movement documents ""1832"".

The car was isolated and shipper, local, state and/or federal agencies were notified (CHEMTREC Report- #2008-06-30-00021). Summit Environmental, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the site along with the area Hazardous Materials Officer from CSXT. Residue material was noted on top of car, near appurtenances and fittings, along with some residue near the ladder wells.  Upon further investigation it was noted that the liquid induction line four-bolt cap had one bolt that was less than tool tight. Contractor personnel tightened the bolt and inspected all other bolts and the rupture disk for integrity.  The top and sides of the car were decontaminated. The leak was secured and the car released for transport. This incident did require a special switching move.

(SIDEWALK WAS AT APEX OF SURFACE AREA AS BOTH THE PARKING LOT AND STREET PAVEMENT DROPPED OFF A SHARP GRADE FROM SIDEWALK. AS THE DOLLY LEG STRUCK THE CONCRETE SIDEWALK, PRESSURE WAS SUCH THAT THE RIGHT-SIDE DOLLY LEG SUPPORT BROKE FREE OF THE TOP MOUNTING AREA AND THE CROSS-BRACE PENETRATED THE BOTTOM OF COMPARTMENT # 2 OF OUR ALUMINUM MC306 TANK TRAILER. THE TRUCK BASICALLY CAME TO A SUDDEN STOP DUE TO THE DOLLY LEG STRIKING THE SIDEWALK; DRIVER THEN EXITED TRACTOR AND NOTED THAT DOLLY LEG WAS GROUNDED ONTO THE SIDEWALK AND THAT HERE WAS SPILLAGE OF GASOLINE COMING FROM UNDER THE TRAILER. DRIVER PLACED CALL TO 911 AS WELL AS OUR TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS CENTER REGARDING THIS SPILL INCIDENT AND PLACED SOP PADS BENEATH THE LEAK AREA COMING OFF TRAILER BELLY. THE LOCAL DELHI TOWNSHIP, OH FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS INITIAL RESPONDER — THEY CORDONED OFF THE AREA AND WOULD NOT ALLOW DRIVER BACK NEAR THE TRANSPORT UNIT AND THEY MADE DECISION TO LET THE GASOLINE PRODUCT TO COMPLETELY RUN OUT OF THE DAMAGED TRAILER COMPARTMENT. FIRE DEPT DID PLACE ABSORBENT MATERIALS (BOOMS AND ALIKE) AT GRATE AREAS TO THE STORM WATER SEWER THAT WERE ON THE PROPERTY ITSELF AS WELL AS A DRAIN THAT WAS ALSO ON STREET THAT WAS ADJACENT TO THE SITE. FIRE DEPARTMENT INITIATED GENERAL RESIDENTIAL EVACUATION FOR A 1000’ AREA AROUND THE INCIDENT SITE. IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT THE STORM WATER DRAINS THAT THE GASOLINE PRODUCT WAS ENTERING INTO 36” MAIN TRUNK LINE FOR THE STORM SEWER SYSTEM. CONSULTATION WITH THE CINCINNATI METROPOLITAN SEWER DISTRICT (CMSD) PERSONNEL RESULTED IN TERMINATION TO “FLUSH” THE SEWER LINE WITH LARGE VOLUMES OF WATER AND TO ALLOW THE CONTAMINANT TO PROCEED TOWARD THE (CMSD) RIVER BASIN AND ON INTO THE OHIO RIVER. DURATION OF THE SPILLAGE OF PRODUCT FROM THE TANK TRAILER WAS FOR APPROX. 30 MINUTES AS IT WAS COMING OUT OF THE APPROX. 3” HOLE THAT THE CROSS BRACE FROM THE TRAILER DOLLY LEG MADE INTO THE TANKER COMPARTMENT (NOTING THAT THE CROSS-BRACE WAS “FILLING-UP” SOME OF THE 3” DIAMETER HOLE AT THAT TIME AS IT HAD PENETRATED THE TRAILER AND WAS STILL STICKING INTO TRAILER COMPARTMENT — SO A FULL 3” HOLE WAS NOT “OPEN FOR THE SPILLAGE AT THE TIME OF THE SPILL INCIDENT).

Released material was identified as Chlorophenols Solid, 6.1, UN2020, PGIII in 16 x 55 gallon steel drums weighing 9577 pounds. The amount released was 1 liter. The material has a melting point of 42 degrees C as described in the MSDS supplied by the consignee. The material is shipped in a solid form but was released as a liquid due to the melting point and the heat in the trailer at the time of the release.  At approximately 21:15 on 19, June, 2008 our trailer returned from local pick up and deliveries in the Parsippany area. Upon arrival to the carrier’s facility the trailer was placed in a door at the carriers dock. When the door was opened an odor was present. The supervisor closed the door immediately and had the trailer moved away from the dock and contacted the carriers safety dept. at approximately 21:30. The supervisor advised of the incident and stated there was an odor throughout the dock and noticeable in the office area. He also stated some employees were complaining due to the odor. All complaints were of a general nature regarding the odor. There were not any complaints of respiratory distress, nausea, skin or eye irritation. No complaints of headache or any other disorientation associated with the product as described in the MSDS.   The carrier immediately called our emergency response contractor at 21:40 and ordered the building be vacated as a precaution. The employees followed the evacuation plan and all departed the building.Each employee was interviewed and refer him or her to our medical facility. All declined and said any slight discomfort was remedied upon moving outside to fresh air. All employees were monitored along with the supervisor at 15-minute intervals for the next hour and all stated no elevation in symptoms and all had returned to their original status prior to the presence of the odor. No one was ever in direct contact with the material.  The emergency response team arrived at 23:50 and departed at 02:00. Their findings were 1-55 gallon drum of 4-Chlorophenol had a small puncture from a nail protruding from the shippers skid causing a 1 liter release. The team donned the required PPE and proceeded with the clean up. The crew removed several skids of drums to get to the leaking drum. The leaking drum was over packed and the trailer decontaminated, the clean up debris was placed in a 17H drum and is currently waiting for pick up and disposal. Both drums were properly labeled and will be picked up by a licensed waste hauler on Tuesday, 8, July, 2008.",This incident was caused by a nail in the bottom of the shippers skid. The nail impacted the drum causing the release. The use of a cardboard barrier between the skid and the drum would have prevented the impact of the nail to the drum. Prior inspection of the skid for protrudung nails would have revealed the exposed nail and also would have eliminated the release.,No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,0,9,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,4170,Estes Express Lines,US,

The vehicle was parked in transit in temporary storage at the Veolia 10-day intransit facility in Latham, NY.  Approximately 5 gallons of a solution of aluminum sulfate had leaked through a tear in the liner of the cubic yard fiberboard box.  The torn liner was sealed and all liquid inside the cubic yard box was absorbed with speedi-dry and absorbant pads.  The material that had leaked onto the floor of the vehicle and asphalt containment was cleaned up with speedi-dry and absorbant pads.  The clean-up materials were placed into a 55-gallon drum for disposal.","It was determined this spill was caused by a tear in the cubic yard box liner due to a sharp edge of solid aluminum sulfate.

Inspector Schwake notified local management and the area around the rail car was isolated.  The shipper, Invista SARL was contacted and requested to respond and secure the container.  Invista representatives were successful in containing the release of product, however were unable to properly repair the bottom outlet valve stem packing.  Since the car no longer complied with DOT specifications the shipper, Invista SARL applied for a FRA Movement Approval.

When one compartment on the cargo tank went empty the driver removed the hose and connector from the UST and then the tank overfilled which caused product to be released from the opening. Approximately 10 gallons of gasoline was released.

The contractor began by assessing the situation and preparing an appropriate course of action.  They utilized a vacuum truck to remove the product from the storm drain.  OEPA officials were on site and had tracked the material through the storm sewer system.  The contractor worked with OEPA and the Dayton Fire Department to flush the storm drains and remove the water from the system.  The pH of the original drain was at 14 when the contractor arrived on site and was declared clear by the OEPA at 12 after several hours of flushing the system and neutralizing the storm sewer with citric acid.  The contractor used granular absorbents to remove the product from the impacted area of the parking lot.  The absorbents were swept from the parking surface and containerized for disposal.  On June 24, 2008, the contractor returned to the site to complete remediation of the impacted area.  They used citric acid and their vacuum truck to remove residual product that was contained in the cracks in the asphalt.  A small area of soil had been impacted by the release and was excavated to remove the contamination.

BINDER,SAFETY SPECIALIST,7201 Hamilton Boulevard,Allentown,PA,18195,Carrier,"Driver left Lancaster terminal around 15:30 heading to Red Bank, NJ to deliver to Meridian Hospital.  Driver drove down PA turnpike to NJ turnpike (where he was stuck in stop and go traffic) to Rt. 195 east to Rt. 18 north.  After going a short distance on Rt. 18 north, the driver noticed a vapor cloud at the rear of his trailer.  The driver looked for a place to pull over and chose an area where an entrance ramp joined in with Rt. 18 and he could position the unit on the shoulder of the entrance ramp to keep the unit as far as possible from the main road.  Upon investigation, the driver found a small liquid leak and vapor cloud at the rear of the trailer.  He cautiously opened the rear cabinet doors to verify the leak was the bottom fill and tired to close it further with his valve wrench.  He was unsuccessful in this attempt and noticed the LOX was dripping directly onto the macadam he was parked on.  He then called EST and was directed to get water to thaw and tighten the bottom fill valve.  At this time a local police officer arrived on scene and told our driver he was not to get near the rear of our trailer and that he had called HAZMAT.  Our driver tried to explain what was needed to be done to get the valve closed, but was refused access to our vehicle.  HAZMAT arrived on scene and promptly closed the northbound lanes of Rt. 18.  The APCI Crisis team was activated and contact was made with the HAZMAT team onsite.  The FCV was tripped to try and stop the leak, but the HAZMAT team was unable to verify the leak was stopped.  After further discussion, it was suggested that water be used to thaw out the valve and this did prove successful in stopping the leak (which is what the driver wanted to do initially).  The whole unit was towed to APCI Manalapan per the request of the HAZMAT/police after it was determined that the tire and running gear were serviceable.  The following morning an inspection was completed on both the running gear and valve piping before the trailer was released to return to Lancaster site.",Trailer is being sent to rehab for further evaluation and valve replacement.

CELLUCCI,"VP, TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT",42 Longwater Drive,Norwell,MA,02061,Carrier,"A Van trailer containing hazardous waste was en route from the shipper’s location to the intended waste management facility. During the course of the trip, the vehicle was stopped at Clean Harbor’s in-transit storage facility located in Santa Clara, CA. While at this location, it was noted that a small amount of material had escaped from the van trailer onto the ground directly beneath the trailer. Facility personnel immediately notified local management and the emergency response procedures were activated. IN addition, notification was made to the appropriate state agency. Facility personnel, using appropriate personnel protective equipment entered the trailer and discovered that a small crack had developed at the seam of the drum allowing approximately 15 gallons of material to escape onto the floor of the van trailer. The container was placed into a suitable salvage drum long with all clean-up debris collected from the van trailer floor and the ground underneath the trailer. This container, once secured was placed back on the trailer and was disposed of at the intended waste management facility.","Subsequent to the initial response activities, information pertaining to the waste stream involved was reviewed. The material was profiled for disposal as a hazardous waste liquid material though it did contain small percentages of both inorganic acids and inorganic bases that were incorporated into the waste stream as a result of the waste generation process. It was expected that the process generating this waste stream resulted in a waste stream that was not corrosive. One possible cause of the drum failure is that the percentages of acids and bases in this specific drum were elevated allowing a reaction to degrade the basic packaging material of the container allowing a crack to develop. Though we are not certain this was the cause, we have suspended the waste stream until additional information is obtained certifying that contents of the waste stream. It is important to note that at the time of loading, the driver inspected the containers and no evidence of damage or leaking was observed. Our drivers will continue to inspect each container and will take appropriate corrective actions should a container of suspect condition be observed.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5200,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc",US,

This shipment was loaded and signed on by New Dock Hire Steve Zuerlein Employee ID 52242. William immediately called me and explained the situation. I then called CHEMTREC 1-800-424-9300 and they informed me to keep the trailer ventilated due to a decrease in oxygen from the helium in the air and to stand the tank upright if possible. William kept the trailer door opened for ventilation and stood the cylinder upright. The valve froze over and stopped leaking. William placed all four cylinders in the nose of his trailer and tied them to the walls and put plywood up and a load bar to secure the shipment. CHEMTREC referred me to a Praxair Representative named Andy who told me that the cylinder needs to be reweighed and depending on the weight it should be fine to deliver.

KOHLER,GENERAL MANAGER,2072 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WEST,WARREN,PA,16365,Carrier,"AR Trucking, Inc driver Craig O’Connor was loading a tanker with crude oil from a tank at the Howard Drilling location en Route 321 approximately 8 miles from Kane, PA when he became ill and lost consciousness. The result of his illness and lost consciousness was the result of food poisoning as the Warren General Hospital later showed upon evaluation of the driver. His loss of consciousness prevented him from shutting down the loading pump when the tanker was full. This resulted in an overflow of approximately 20 to 21 barrels of oil most of which was recovered as oil or by clean up. According to the Department of Environmental Protection, approximately 2 gallons of oil made it to the South Branch of the Kinzua Creek and the bulk of those 2 gallons were recovered as clean up. When the spill was discovered by our driver, he enlisted the aid of two Howard Drilling employees who helped damn up the oil on the ground and called AR Trucking, Inc immediately for help. Four employees went directly to the site and began cleanup with employees from the American Refining Group, Howard Drilling and C line Oil. The DEP commented that the immediate reaction saved more oil from hitting the waterway and we were all commended for the quick response and actions taken. Per the DEP’s suggestion, a professional cleanup company was hired by us to dictate the balance of the cleanup which was completed by mid July and included in my final report to the DEP and the Environmental Protection Agency, which has now considered the case closed. The duration of the release was most likely approximately two to five minutes. AR Trucking Inc is now installing See-Level Gauges with Spill Stop Switches in our tanker trucks, In the event a driver becomes incapacitated) the unit will shut down the pump when the tank becomes full preventing any overfill and any spill. This is a safety feature both for our drivers and the environment in which we work.",We encourage our drivers to inform us of any and all Illnesses so that we can determine if they can safely perform their daily duties. The installation of the See-Level Gauges and Spill Stop Switches was our recommendation for prevention of any future spills.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,,US,

While extracting material from a storage unit using a highvolume vacuum system the unit shut down prematurely causing a release of product. Typically a high volume unitsuch as this is utilized on high viscous/high gravity material. In this application the volume of air and fluid mixturecaused the product to foam in the vessel giving false readings to primary and secondary shutoffs causing a releaseof product from the venting system in conjunction with the vacuum pump. Approximately 10 gallons was released toan asphalt base which was immediately absorbed with absorbent material. With the unit shut down, product neededto be transferred back into the storage unit to allow for the reset of the primary and secondary shutoffs. Whileattempting to reload the storage unit from the vacuum vessel an overflow of product occurred in a containment areadue to the lack of gauging required to conduct the transfer in an orderly fashion. The resulting overflow releasedapproximately 80 gallons of liquid into containment.-","All of the vacuum truck check systems were in place and functional which helped to ensure that a larger release didnot occur. Since the incident, United has set up routine communications with AMRI-Rensselaer so routine pickupsare scheduled and inventory is kept low. Future transfer of this type of material will not be performed with a highvolume vacuum system unless the vacuum tank unit volume is less then 70% of tank capacity. This will insure anyproduct foaming will not cause a premature shut down of the vacuum system. United has also made it a practice tosend the same trained personnel to this location. The personnel sent to this location are familiar with the operationsat this location and the types of materials to be handled. United Industrial Services feels these steps will help ensurethat future releases will not occur.",No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,UNITED INDUSTRIAL SERVICES,US,

The incident location was on South Talens Rd approximately 2 miles south of LA 14 in KlocJjke, LA. SIT Dayries was advised that company representatives were on site as well as a wrecker service. SiT t)ayries contacted the Cameron Parish Sheriff’s Office and spoke with a dispatcher who then patched me through to an on-scene deputy. Dpty Hebert advised that the bobtail had run off the road and rolled over into a canal. The bobtail was rolled over on the pissenger side and was in approximately 4 to 5 feet of water. There was also a slight leak of gasoline, unknown where it was leaking from. Talens personnel placed out boom to capture any product. The driver was taken by company personnel to the hospital in Jennings. S/T Dayriés advised Dpty Hebert to make sure no one attempted to roll truck or transfer any material until S/T Dayries arrived on scene.  S/T Dayries arrived on the scene at 1730 hrs he mel with Talens Marine Regional Operations Director Rod Boucireaux and S ,H.& E Compliance Manager Chris Scalisi. They advised that the wrecker service was on site and that they had d spatched Oil Mop to respond to the scene. Mr. Boudreaux advised that the driver had been taken to the Jennings Hospital for precautionary measures as well as to have the necessary drug and alcohol testing required by the company. Sit’ Dayries walked up to the overturned tanker and did observe a slight sheen and smelled an odor of gasoline. The release appeared to be coming from the vent piping. The release was small but continuous. After observing the bobtail ranker it was determined that the tank would need to be off-loaded prior to up-righting. Due to the valves being buried in the mud and under water the oriLy method of transfer would be driLling holes into each compartment and sucking out the product from each tank. S/T Daynies spoke with Oil Mop supervisor Jerome Gaspard about this method and he had no problem performing these operations. DEQ responder Danny Chapman arrived on the scene He was briefed of the incident and began to perform air monitoring. All readings were normal.

The container was transporting sulfuric acid. Wenck Associates, Inc. (Wenck) received a call from Mr. Dale Buckholtz of Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) requesting emergency response assistance associated with the above-referenced container. Wenck dispatched an emergency response team to assist in the response activities. Once onsite Wenck had CPR personnel secure track protection in order to safely perform all necessary activities. The response crew donned personal protective equipment and assessed the situation. Upon investigation it was noted that the manway gasket had moved from the sealing surfaces of the manway hatch cover. The response crew opened the manway cover and replaced the gasket into the grooves. The manway cover was re-secured using a 24 inch pipe wrench. Exterior surfaces of the railcar were ph adjusted utilizing a Simple Green... and water mixture. Simple green is a non toxic biodegradable cleaner/surfactant. Tank car GATX 7534 originated in Trail, British Columbia Canada. Wenck contacted Teck Cominco metals, Ltd. (a.cethe shippera.) to notify them of the incident.
