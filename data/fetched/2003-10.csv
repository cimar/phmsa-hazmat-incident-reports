THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE FROM CSXT, DUPONT, OR OLIN THAT ANY OF THE CARS IN QUESTION HAD EXPERIENCED ANY UNUSUAL HANDLING OR HARD COUPLING'S IN TRANSIT.  CSXT WITH OLIN'S COOPERATION HAS INITIATED A PLAN TO EQUIP SEVERAL TANK CARS WITH IMPACT RECORDERS THAT WILL MONITOR COUPLING IMPACTS TO DETERMINE IF CAR HANDLING COULD BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN A POSSIBLE PRODUCT RELEASE FROM THE PRD'S.  THE STUDY WILL BEGIN THE LATTER PART OF DECEMBER AND WILL CONTINUE INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004.  EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE RESIDUE DISCOVERED AROUND THE PRD'S WAS DUE TO A PRODUCT RELEASE IN TRANSIT, CSXT IS SUBMITTING THIS REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH 171.16 OF THE US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION'S HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REGULATIONS, 49 CFR.",,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

HERMAN INFORMED ME THAT HIM AND ANOTHER N&M TRANSFER DRIVER (JAMES PALMBACH) JUST BECAME AWARE OF A SPILL OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL COMING OUT OF THE BACK OF JIM'S TRAILER.  HERMAN AND JIM WERE BOTH ON THE PROPERTY OF FIRE PLACE PRODUCTS, 515 BUSSE RD., ELK GROVE VILLAGE, IL. I IMMEDIATELY ADVISED HERMAN TO CALL 911.  OVER THE NEXT HOUR I CONTINUED TO DISCUSS THE SPILL WITH HERMAN AND JIM.  AS I QUESTIONED THE CHAIN OF EVENTS HERMAN STATED THAT HE HAD ALREADY PULLED HIS TRACTOR-TRAILER INTO THE DOCK AT FIREPLACE PRODUCTS.  JIM HAD ARRIVED AT FIRE PLACE PRODUCTS ABOUT 4:15 PM. NO DOCK OPEN SO HE SAT OUTSIDE IN THE LOT FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES UNTIL 4:30 PM.  AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30 A DOCK DOOR OPENED AND JIM BEGAN BACKING HIS TRAILER AGAINST THE A DOCK DOOR THAT WAS TWO DOORS TO THE RIGHT OF HERMAN'S TRAILER.  APPARENTLY HERMAN SAID HE HEARD A SCRAPING NOISE AS JIM WAS BACKING HIS TRAILER IN.  HE WAS CURIOUS SO WHEN HE WALKED TO THE DOCK DOOR JIM JUST PULLED IN TO, HE NOTICED THAT AN IGLOO COOLER WAS STUCK BETWEEN THE DOCK WALL AND THE TRAILER'S ICC BAR.  HERMAN THAN ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE DOOR OF THE TRAILER AND HE ADVISED ME THEN THAT AT THE TIME A WAVE OF LIQUID BEGAN COMING OUT THE BACK DOOR ON TO THE DOCK PLATE AND GROUND SURFACE.  HERMAN IMMEDIATELY ADVISED JIM WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  JIM WENT BACK IN TO HIS TRUCK AND MOVED THE VEHICLE OUT ABOUT 20 FEET FROM THE DOCK. IN TO THE LOT.  (APPARENTLY THERE WAS STORM SEWER LOCATED ON THE GROUND AT THAT SPOT SO HE AGAIN MOVED THE TRAILER ABOUT 100 FEET TO ANOTHER LOT AT 501 BUSSE RD).  HE THEN NOTICED ANOTHER STORM SEWER IN THAT AREA, SO HE DECIDED TO MOVE THE TRAILER ANOTHER 700-800 FEET. (SEE PHOTO OF THE FINAL RESTING SPOT OF TRAILER IN THE PRIVATE PARKING LOT AREA).  LATER IT WAS REPORTED THAT ALL THREE AREAS WHERE JIM PARKED THE VEHICLE HAD SOME TYPE OF STORM SEWER.  AS FAR AS EMERGENCY PERSONNEL THE ELK GROVE VILLAGE POLICE WERE THE FIRST TO RESPOND TO THE SCENE.  THEY ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 5:20 PM.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ANOTHER 5-10 MINUTES LATER.  OUR RECORDS INDICATED THAT A CITY-COUNTY HAZ/MAT TEAM WAS ON THE SCENE BY 5:28 PM. THERE WERE ALSO PERSONNEL FROM THE METROPOLITAN WATER REMEDIATION DEPARTMENT ON THE SCENE.  THE CAUSE OF THE SPILL (SEE PHOTOS OF RUPTURE AREA ON THE IBC'S).  AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT IT IS OFFICIALLY UNDETERMINED.  HOWEVER AFTER THE SPILL CLEAN UP WAS COMPLETED AND ALL VEHICLES WERE RELEASED OUR DRIVERS INFORMED US THAT TWO OF THE 13 IBC'S WERE DRAINED BY THE REMEDIATION COMPANY HIRED BY OUR INSURANCE CARRIER. (SET ENVIRONMENTAL INC., 450 SUMAC RD. WHEELING, IL.,60090.)  ONE IBC WAS CLEARLY RUPTURED WITH AN ESTIMATED 6-8"" CRACK IN THE TOP RIGHT SIDE.  I WAS ADVISED THAT THIS CRACK OPENED UP AT THE SPILL SITE WHEN SET ATTEMPTED TO DRAIN THIS TANK.
