I SENT THE ACETYLENE SUPERVISOR IMMEDIATELY TO THE SCENE AND CALLED THE WET MEMPHIS FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THE FIRE SEPARTMENT STATED THAT THEY WERE ON THE SCENE AND WOULD WAIT UNTIL MY SUPERVISOR ARRIVED BEFORE ATEMPTING TO PUT OUT THE FIRE.  CHUCK BRITTON (ACETYLENE SUPERVISOR) ARRIVED ON THE SCENE, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT LET HIM TAKE CHARGE.  HE REPORTED THAT (2) B ( 40 CUBIC FEET ACETYLENE CYLINDERS) HAD FALLEN OFF OUR TRAILERAND ON STRICKING THE PAVEMENT, THE VALVE SHEARED OFF.  THE GAS IN THE TWO CYLINDERS INGNITED AND WAS BURNING  OVER NEXT TO THE GUARDRAIL. CHUCK WAS CARRYING A FIRE EXTINGUISHER APPROVED FOR THIS TYPE OF FIRE AND EXTINGUISHED THEM.  AFTER THE FIRE WAS OUT CHUCK AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT GATHERED UP THE CYLINDER, CHECKING TO BE SURE THE NUMBER ON THE GROUND, MATCHED THE MANIFEST AND LOADED THEM INTO A SERVICE TRUCK.  THE FIRE CHIEF SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW WHY THE DOT PEOPLE HADN'T ARRIVED BUT RELEASED OUR TRAILER AND SUPERVISOR TO LEAVE THE SCENE.  THE TRACTOR TRAILER AND SERVICE TRUCK WERE ROUTED BACK TO THE PLANT, WHERE A NEW LOAD OF CYLINDERS WERE LOADED AND THE TRUCK WAS RE-DISPATCHED TO BLYTHEVILLE, ARKANSAS.  THE CYLINDERS INVOLVED HAVE BEEN QUARANTINED FOR A SAFETY INSPECTION AND THE CYLINDERS WILL BE SCRAPED PENDING INSEPCTION.  THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS; 1.  THOSE TYPE CYLINDERS ARE SMALL AND WERE NOT TIED DOWN SUFFICIENTLY TO WITHSTAND THAT TYPE OF BUMP CROSSING THAT OVERPASS. 2. EVEN THOUGH THE SPEED AT THAT STRETCH HAD BEEN REDUCED TO 45 MPH WE HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED OUR DRIVERS TO REDUCE BELOW 40 MPH UNTIL THE CONSSTRUCTION HAD FIXED THESE BUMPS.  3.
