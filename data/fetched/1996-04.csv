ON WEDNESDAY APRIL 10, 1996 THE N & M TRANSFER SAFETY DEPARTMENT RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM AN N & M DRIVER REGARDING A SPILL IN HIS TRAILER.  THE DRIVER ADVISED THAT HE HAD JUST PULLED IN TO A DOCK AT MOLDED DIMENSIONS, PORT WASHINGTON, WI, WHEN HE NOTICED LIQUID POURING OUT THE BACK OF HIS TRAILER.  THE DRIVER WAS AWARE THAT THE ONLY LIQUID CONTAINER WITHIN THE BACK HALF OF HIS TRAILER WAS HAZARDOUS MATERIAL (FLAMMABLE LIQUID) JUST PICKED UP AT THE PREVIOUS STOP.  SAFETY IMMEDIATELY ASKED HIM IF THE MATERIAL WAS POURING IN TO ANY KIND OF A DRAIN OR SEWER WITHIN THE DOCK.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY CHECKED AND ADVISED THAT IT WAS POURING IN TO A DRAIN NEXT TO THE BUILDING WITHIN THE DOCK AREA.  THE DRIVER WAS UNABLE TO HALT THE FLOW OF THE MATERIAL ANY FURTHER.  EMPLOYEES AT MOLDED DIMENSIONS CALLED THE LOCAL PORT WASHINGTON FIRE DEPARTMENT.  FIRE, POLICE, AND EMERGENCY GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE CALL.  THE CAUSE OF THE SPILL WAS 8 BIG RACKS ON WHEELS THAT THE DRIVER FAILED TO SECURE PROPERLY.  (THE DRIVER STATES THAT HE DID SECURE THE RACKS WITH A LOAD LOCK, BUT THE FORCE OF THE RACKS BROKE THE LOAD LOCK IN TWO).  WHEN THE RACKS BROKE LOOSE, THEY RAMMED THE METAL (55) GALLONS DRUM.  ALL 55 GALLONS WERE LOST AT THE SCENE.  A PRIVATE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE COMPANY WAS CALLED IN FROM FOND DU LACE, WI.  THIS COMPANY DID COMPLETE DECONTAMINATION OF THE GROUNDS, TRAILER, AND DRAINAGE SYSTEM LOCATED ON MOLDED DIMENSIONS PROPERTY.

PRIOR TO DISPATCH, THE DRIVER PERFORMED THE REQUIRED PRE-TRIP INSPECTION ON THE VEHICLE HE WAS ASSIGNED TO OPERATE.  THIS INCLUDED AN INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE'S SCRUBBER SYSTEM WHICH IS CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT THERE IS NO RESIDUAL MATERIAL IN THIS UNIT FROM A PREVIOUS SHIPMENT.  THE DRIVER FOUND NO RESIDUAL MATERIAL IN THIS SYSTEM DURING THIS INSPECTION.  ********  UPON ARRIVAL AT 151 RAYMOND BOULEVARD, THE DRIVER INITIATED THE LOADING PROCEDURES.  AS HE STARTED THE VACUUM SYSTEM, APPROXIMATELY 1 GALLON OF MATERIAL ESCAPED FROM THE EXHAUST STACK OF THE SCRUBBER SYSTEM ONTO A FULLY CONTAINED LOADING AREA WHERE IT WAS PREVENTED FROM CONTAMINATING THE SOIL AT THE SITE.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE LOADING OPERATION AND CONTACTED HIS HOME DISPATCHER WHO, IN TURN, DISPATCHED A COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE TO THE SCENE.  AT THIS POINT, THE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE WHO ARRIVED AT THE RELEASE LOCATION, NOTIFIED THE SITE CONTACT.  A CLEAN-UP CREW WAS ALSO DISPATCHED IN ORDER TO CLEAN-UP THE SPILL DEBRIS.  UPON ARRIVAL, THE CREW ABSORBED ALL FREE LIQUIDS WITH ABSORBENT PADS AND PLACED THESE, ALONG WITH ALL OTHER SPILL DEBRIS INTO A 55 GALLON DRUM.  THIS CONTAINER WAS PLACED INTO STORAGE PENDING OFF-SITE DISPOSAL AT A FULLY LICENSED WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITY.  IN ADDITION, THE SPILL AREA WAS PRESSURE WASHED TO REMOVE RESIDUAL STAINING CAUSED BY THE MATERIAL RELEASED FROM THE EXHAUST STACK.  APPROXIMATELY 200 GALLONS OF RINSE WATER WAS COLLECTED AND SENT FOR DISPOSAL ALONG WITH THE RAINWATER ORIGINALLY SLATED FOR DISPOSAL TO CLEAN HARBORS OF BALTIMORE, INC. LOCATED AT 1910 RUSSELL STREET IN BALTIMORE, MD.  PLEASE NOTE THAT PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF CLEAN HARBOR'S NEW JERSEY HAZARDOUS AND SOLID WASTE TRANSPORTER PERMITS, THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION (""NJDEP"") AND WAS ASSIGNED CASE # 96-4-10-1044-46.  IN ADDITION, PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER OF THE SITE WHERE CLEAN HARBORS EXPERIENCED THE RELEASE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THIS RELEASE AND WAS NOT REQUIRED TO NOTIFY FEDERAL OR STATE AGENCIES. ********* A REVIEW OF THE VEHICLE INDICATED THAT MATERIAL FROM A PREVIOUS SHIPMENT HAD EITHER SOLIDIFIED OR FROZE IN THE EXHAUST LINE OF THE SCRUBBER SYSTEM.

THE MATERIAL HAD FREE FLOWING CORROSIVE LIQUID IN THE MIXTURE OF SOLID MATERIAL.  BEING OF A CORROSIVE NATURE IT BEGAN TO EAT THE SUPERSACK, WHEN IT GOT BETWEEN THE INNER LINER AND THE SUPERSACK.  THAT PLUS THE FACT THAT THE SUPERSACK WAS FILLED BEYOND SPECIFICATION CAUSED THE SUPERSACK TO SPLIT OPEN AT ITS SIDE WALL LESS THAN 24 MILES AFTER PICKING UP THE MATERIAL.  THE DRIVER NOTICED THE BAG SHIFTING AND PULLED OVER TO INSPECT THE SUPERSACK.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE CONTAINER HE SAW THAT THE SUPERSACK HAD SPLIT DOWN THE SIDE.  THE DRIVER USED PLASTIC MATERIAL FROM THE ON BOARD EMERGENCY RESPONSE KIT TO PROTECT THE GROUND AND TO CATCH ANY DRIPPINGS.  THE DRIVER THEN CALLED HIS HOMEBASE TO REQUEST OVER PACKS AND MAN POWER TO SHOVEL THE CONTENTS INTO THE OVER PACK DRUMS. ********* DESCRIPTION OF RESPONSE:  THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE REMAINED WITH HIS VEHICLE UNTIL HELP ARRIVED FROM HIS HOMEBASE. AT THAT TIME PLASTIC WAS PUT ON THE FLOOR OF THE FLATBED AND THE MATERIAL WAS SHOVELED OUT OF THE SUPERSACK AND INTO THE OVERPACK DRUMS.  THE DRUMS WERE LABELED AS HAZARDOUS WASTE.  THE MANIFEST WAS CHANGED TO REFLECT THE CONTAINER CHANGE, AND THE MATERIAL WAS SENT TO THE HOMEBASE TO BE HELD FOR 10 DAYS PENDING COORDINATON TO THE TSDF FOR FINAL DISPOSAL.  ******** ACTION TAKEN:  THE GENERATOR OF THE HAZARDOUS WASTE WAS INFORMED BY PHONE THAT THE SUPERSACK WAS OVER FILLED AND THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE SUPERSACK WERE NOT SOLID AS DESCRIBED ON THE MANIFEST, AND THAT THE MATERIAL HAD GOTTEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE INNER PLASTIC LINER.  ****** RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) PUT THE PRODUCT INTO STEEL DRUMS.  2) WEIGH EACH CONTAINER TO ENSURE THAT IT IS NOT FILLED BEYOND D.O.T.

HE LEFT THE CHEROKEE FACILITY AT APPROXIMATELY 12:30PM.  PAT TOOK AN ALTERNATE ROUTE (2ND ST. CHEROKEE-DEKALB-PRESIDENT) DUE TO THE CONSTRUCTION AT BROADWAY.  THIS ROUTE IS MORE ROUGH AND JARRING THAN 2ND ST.  PAT ARRIVED AT THE DEKALB GATE.  WHILE WAITING FOR THE GATE TO BE OPENED, HE NOTICED STEAM IN HIS SIDE MIRROR.  WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR TO GET OUT, HE INHALED THE HCL FUMES THAT WERE BEING BLOWN IN HIS DIRECTION BY THE WIND. PAT STATED THAT HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY WHAT THE FUMES WERE. HE GRABBED HIS SHIPPING PAPERS AND GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK, PUT THE SHIPPING PAPERS ON THE BUMPER AND DISENGAGED THE SECONDARY LATCH FOR THE ERT TEAM.  FUMES WERE SPEWING OUT AROUND THE REAR DOOR.  PAT INHALED FUMES A SECOND TIME.  PAT MADE HIS WAY TO THE GUARD SHACK AND DIALED THE EMERGENCY NUMBER AT APPROXIMATELY 12:40 P.M. ERT MEMBERS WERE AT THE SITE MOMENTARILY.  RICH KLASS ASSUMED THE IC ROLE. INITIALLY SODIUM BICARBONATE WAS THROWN ON THE STREET, AROUND THE TRUCK AND ON THE FUEL TANK.  THE TRUCK WAS BROUGHT ON SITE.  ERT MEMBERS BEGAN HOSING DOWN THE TRUCK AS WELL AS PUTTING DOWN MORE SODIUM BICARBONATE ON THE STREET.  THE TRUCK WAS UNLOADED UP TO THE LEAKING PALLET AND ALL MATERIAL WAS DECONTAMINATED.  THE HCL PALLET WAS REMOVED FROM THE TRUCK. THE ONE LEAKING DRUM WAS PULLED OFF THE PALLET AND PLACED IN AN OVERPACK CONTAINER WHICH WAS PLACED IN THE K-4 HOOD.  THE TWO REMAINING GOOD DRUMS WERE DECONTAMINATED AND PUT IN THE K-4 HOOD ALSO WHILE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF SODIUM BICARBONATE WERE BEING DUMPED ONTO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.  THE SODIUM BICARBONATE WAS HOSED DOWN AND SPREAD TO THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK BOX IN ORDER TO NEUTRALIZE THE ACID.  THE TRUCK WAS BACKED INTO K-DOCK WHERE IT WAS HOSED DOWN SOME MORE. THE BALANCE OF MATERIAL WAS UNLOADED AND HOSED DOWN.  THE TRUCK WAS HOSED DOWN INSIDE AND OUT, THEN THE BOX WAS SATURATED WITH A SODIUM BICARBONATE SOLUTION AND LEFT TO SIT OVERNIGHT. NO FURTHER INJURIES (OTHER THAN PAT) OCCURRED.  THE PROVISIONAL ALL CLEAR WAS GIVEN AFTER TWO HOURS.  NOTE ALL HCL RESIDUE WAS NEUTRALIZED THROUGH SIGMA'S WASTEWATER NEUTRALIZATION SYSTEM. THE PROBABLE OF THE LEAKING HCL DRUM IS A NAIL PUNCTURE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE DRUM.  WHEN THE NAIL PUNCTURED THE DRUM IS UNRESOLVED.  WE CAN SPECULATE THAT THE DRUMS SHIFTED ON THE TRUCK AT SOME POINT BETWEEN THE LOADING DOCK AT CHEROKEE AND THE DEKALB GATE AT PRESIDENT STREET.  WE DO KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT THE DRUM WAS NOT LEAKING IN THE STAGING AREA AT CHEROKEE PRIOR TO LOADING.  THE PALLET BEING TRANSPORTED WAS A NEW PALLET BOUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SIGMA SPECIFICATIONS.  THE NAIL HEADS PROTRUDING FROM THE PALLET WERE ALL LESS THAN A DIME'S THICKNESS IN HEIGHT.  IT APPEARS THE DRUM MAY HAVE BEEN FAULTY.  THE DRUM POLY WALL THICKNESS AT THE EDGE OF THE BASE OF THE DRUM WAS INADEQUATE AS IT APPEARED TO BE THINNER AT THE SEAM THAN REQUIRED. THE DRUM APPEARED TO BE USED OR RECONDITIONED.

HE ALSO DIDN'T CHECK THE TANK SIZE PROPERLY.  LASTLY HE DID NOT STAY WITH THE TRUCK.  HE WENT INSIDE THE STORE.  WHILE IN THE STORE THE MANAGER SMELLED GAS AND RAN OUTSIDE.  HE COULD NOT FIND OUR DRIVER IMMEDIATELY.  OUR DRIVER RAN TO THE TRUCK, BY NOW APPROXIMATELY 20 GALLONS HAD OVERFLOWED FROM THE VAPOR OUTLET.  HE SHUT EVERYTHING OFF.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED IMMEDIATELY.  HE TRIED TO CLEAN-UP THE SPILL WITH WHAT HE HAD.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, E.P.A. AND COMPANY OFFICIALS ARRIVED WITHIN THE HOUR.  THE SPILL WAS CONTAINED AND DID NOT GO INTO ANY SEWER DRAINS.  OUR  COMPANY THEN CLEANED THE REMAINDER OF THE SPILL WITH ABSORBENT, BROOMS AND SHOVELS.  DAVID RALEY HAS BEEN PROPERLY TRAINED BY OUR COMPANY AND KNOWINGLY BROKE THE RULES.  WHEN CONFRONTED HE ACTED LIKE HE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

THE CONTAINER WAS PLACARDED FLAMMABLE SOLID, AND WAS BEING MOVED TO TRAILER STORAGE LOT #16 WHERE IT COULD BE ISOLATED PENDING INSPECTION. AS MANAGER COOPER WAS OUT OF TOWN, HE ADVISED MS. MCGEE TO CONTACT ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSLOADING SERVICES (ETS), AND HAVE THEM RESPOND WITH A TEAM TO CONTAIN AND INVESTIGATE THE LEAK.  ETS INSPECTED THE CONTAINER AND FOUND AN UNKNOWN AMBER FLUID LEAKING FROM THE REAR DOORS OF THE CONTAINER. THE LIQUID WAS FIELD TESTED AND FOUND TO BE FLAMMABLE.  SEVERAL INCONSISTENCIES WERE NOTED AT THIS TIME.  THE RAILROAD WAYBILL INFORMATION ONLY SHOWED 1 DRUM LISTED AS A FLAMMABLE SOLID, ORGANIC , N.O.S., A STABLILZED PARA SUBSTITUTED PHENYL DIAZONIUM SALT.  THERE WAS NO INFORMATION ON ANY FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS.  THE CONTAINER HAD BEEN PLACARDED WITH FLAMMABLE SOLID PLACARDS, HOWEVER, THEY WERE IMPROPERLY APPLIED, BEING PLACED SQUARE ON THE CONTAINER WITH THE LETTERING READING AT A 45 DEGREE UPWARD ANGLE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, RATHER THAT BEING PLACED SQUARE ON POINT AS REQUIRED BY THE REGULATIONS.  UPON OPENING THE REAR DOORS TO INSPECT THE LADING, DEVELOPED THERE WAS NO BLOCKING OR BRACING TO SECURE THE LADING.  THERE WERE 3 EACH LARGE WOOD CRATES AT THE DOORWAY THAT MEASURED ROUGHLY 6 FOOT WIDE BY 8 FOOT LONG BY 1 FOOT HIGH WHICH WERE STACKED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.  IT WAS APPARENT THE LOAD HAD SHIFTED AS THE CRATES HAD MOVED LATERALLY WITHIN THE CONTAINER.  DIRECTLY FORWARD OF THE CRATES WERE 55 GALLON METAL DRUMS THAT HAD FLAMMABLE LIQUID LABELS.  THERE WAS NO LOAD SEPARATION BETWEEN THE CRATES AND THE DRUMS.  THE DRUMS WERE PLACED 3 EACH TO A PALLET, WITH NO SECUREMENTS TO EACH OTHER OR TO THE PALLET.  THE DRUMS HAD BEEN LOADED WITH ADDTIONAL DRUMS PLACED ON TOP OF THE FLOOR STACKED DRUMS, AGAIN, WITH NO SEPARATION BETWEEN THE PALLET AND THE DRUMS, AND, NO SECUREMENT OF THE UPPER DRUMS.  IN ANOTHER INSTANCE PALLETS CONTAINING BAGGED GRANULATED PRODUCT, WERE PLACED ON TOP OF THE DRUMS, AGAIN, WITH NO SEPARATION BETWEEN THE PALLET AND THE DRUMS.  THE BAGGED PRODUCT WEIGHT WAS ESTIMATED TO EXCEED 1000 POUNDS. THERE IS NO RECOMMENDED PROTOCOL FOR THIS METHOD OF LOADING DRUMS, AND IT IS NOT AN APPROVED METHOD PER BOE6C FOR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.  ETS RE-CONTACTED APL TO OBTAIN AN UPDATED BILL OF LADING, WHICH SHIPCO PROVIDED, SHOWING AS A FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S., CONTAINING NAPTHA, WITH A WEIGHT FACTOR OF 2,724 POUNDS, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE PLACARDING FOR THE LIQUIDS.  THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTAINER WAS MONITORED FOR FLAMMABLE VAPORS, WHICH WAS BELOW THE 10% LEVEL.  AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, THE CONTAINER WAS VENTILATED IN THE EVENT THERE WERE OTHER UNDECLARED MATERIALS ENCOUNTERED.
