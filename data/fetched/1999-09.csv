WHILE TRAVELING SOUTH ON I-25, SOUTH OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF DENVER, THE TRAILER CAME OFF THE FIFTH WHEEL OF THE TRACTOR.  THE TRAILER FELL DOWN ONTO ITS NOSE AND TRAVELED ALONG THE PAVEMENT FOR APPROXIMATELY 100 YARDS BEFORE STOPPING.  THE LOADING FACILITY AT CONOCO IN COMMERCE CITY IS BOTTOM LOADING.  WHEN THE TRAILER BECAME DISLOGED FROM THE TRACTOR IT FELL ONTO ITS NOSE THEN ONTO THE GROUND.  WHEN THE TRAILER CONTACTED THE GROUND, THE FRONT DISCHARGE TUBE ON #1 COMPARTMENT WAS TORN OFF BY THE ROADWAY.  SINCE THE TRAILER WAS BOTTOM LOADED, THE PRODUCT CONTAINED IN THE DISCHARGE TUBE ESCAPED AND SPILLED.  THE SPILLAGE IS ESTIMATED AT 10 GALLONS.  THE FIRE VALVE IN #1 COMPARTMENT, ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISLODGED DISCHARGE TUBE HELD TIGHT AND NO FURTHER PRODUCT WAS LOST FROM THE COMPARTMENT.  THE TUBE AND FIRE VALVE PERFORMED AS DESIGNED.  THE TUBE BROKE AWAY, AND THE FIRE VALVE HELD SECURE.  THE ROADWAY IN THE AREA OF THE INCIDENT IS VERY WAVY OR WASHBOARD.
