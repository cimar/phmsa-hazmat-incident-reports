ALL ACTIONS TAKEN WERE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTY OF HENRICO, THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. AFTER THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION WE BELIEVE THE DRUM FAILED WITHOUT CAUSE(SEE ATTACHED PHOTOGRAPH).  THERE IS NO EXTERNAL DAMAGE TO THE DRUM. IT WAS ON A PLASTIC  PALLET AND WAS BRACED WITH A STRAP TO THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK (SEE DIAGRAM).  THERE WERE NO PROTRUSIONS ON THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THAT COULD HAVE PUNCTURED THE DRUM.  WE OBTAINED AN OPINION FROM A LOCAL DRUM RECONDITIONER AND THEIR BELIEF WAS ALSO DRUM FAILURE. WE HAVE CONTACTED THE DRUM MANUFACTURER TO ASK FOR ASSISTANCE IN DETERMINING THE PROBLEM.

ON TOP OF THE HILL, THERE WAS A CURVE.  THE DRIVER USED THE  BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN. HE WAS THEN GOING APPROX. 20 MPH. AT THE END OF THE CURVE, A CAR WAS COMING ON THE OTHER SIDE.  THE CAR WAS A LITTLE ON HIS SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH ONE WHEEL ON THE LANE.  THE TRUCK DRIVER GAVE A SMALL TURN TO THE RIGHT, ON THE WHEEL.  THE CAR DID THE SAME AND PASSED EACH OTHER WITH NO PROBLEM WHAT SO EVER.  BUT WHEN HE GAVE THE WHEEL A SMALL TURN TO THE RIGHT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TRUCK WENT ON THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  THE SHOULDER IS MADE OF SAND SO THE TRUCK SANK IN A LITTLE TO GET OUT OF THERE HE HAD TO GIVE THE WHEEL  A TURN TO THE LEFT.  WHEN ALL THE WHEEL WHERE BACK ON THE PAVEMENT THEY HAD TO GIVE THE WHEEL ANOTHER TURN TO THE RIGHT AND THAT IS WHEN HE SAW THE TANK TRAILER.  GOING UP IN THE AIR ON THE LEFT SIDE.  A FEW SECONDS LATER THE TRAILER AND THE TRUCK FELL ON THEIR RIGHT SIDES.  THE TRUCK DRIVER GOT OUT BY HIMSELF THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  HE WAS ALONE, A FEW MINUTES LATER PEOPLE STARTED ARRIVING.  THE TRUCK DRIVER WANTED TO GO AND STOP THE LEAKING BY PUTTING HIS JACKET IN THE HOLE.  BUT 2 MEN STOPPED HIM. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO DANGER DOING THIS AND IT WOULD HAVE PREVENTED A LOT. PLUS LESS PRODUCT WOULD HAVE SPILLED.  BUT THE POLICE OFFICERS DIDN'T WANTED THE TRUCK DRIVER TO DO THIS THEY WERE SAYING IT WAS GOING TO EXPLODE, WHICH WAS NOT TRUE.  AFTER THIS THE TRUCK DRIVER LEFT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL SO THE POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREMAN WHERE IN CHARGE.  WHEN THE PRODUCT STOPPED LEAKING OUT OF TRAILER, THEY PUT IT BACK ON ITS WHEELS THE CLEANING WAS DONE THE FOLLOWING DAYS.

THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE 2, A HANDICAPPED SENIOR CITIZEN, SEEMED CONFUSED AND MADE A ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE HIGHWAY BUT THEN STOPPED AGAIN.  THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE 1 SLOWED AND SWERVED RIGHT IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID CONTACT.  AT A ESTIMATED SPEED OF THEN 30 MPH VEHICLE 1 MADE CONTACT WITH LEFT REAR CORNER OF VEHICLE 2 KNOCKING IT ACROSS THE INTERSECTION.  VEHICLE 1 THEN SLID INTO A EARTHEN STORM DITCH AND LAID OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE AGAINST THE HIGH SIDE OF THE DITCH. THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE 1 EXITED THE TRUCK AND CHECKED FOR LEAKS.  HE RECEIVED MINOR BRUISES TO HIS RIGHT KNEE AND HIP AND A SMALL CUT ON HIS HAND.  HE THEN WENT TO CHECK ON THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE 2 AND FOUND THAT THE FEMALE DRIVER WAS UNCONSCIOUS.  A PASSING MOTORIST CALLED 911 SERVICES AND ASSISTED THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE 1 TO DIVERT TRAFFIC.  THE LA HAZMAT RESPONSE TEAM WAS CALLED OUT ALONG WITH A LIFE FLIGHT HELICOPTER AND AMBULANCE.  THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE 2 WAS EVACUATED BY HELICOPTER.  THE DRIVER OF VEHICLE 1 WAS TAKEN BY AMBULANCE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR OBSERVATION AND POST ACCIDENT DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING.  THOSE RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE.  THE LA HIGHWAY PATROL AND THE LA HAZMAT RESPONSE TEAM CLOSED THE HIGHWAY AND RE-ROUTED TRAFFIC AT 0940.  THEY REQUESTED A WRECKER TO SERVICE TO UPRIGHT VEHICLE 1 AND REMOVE VEHICLE 2.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION OF VEHICLE 1 A VERY SMALL VAPOR LEAK WAS FOUND AT A FITTING ON THE CARGO TANK DELIVERY VALVE.  PROAM SERVICE TECHNICIANS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO STOP THE VAPOR LEAK WHICH ONLY REQUIRED THE RE-TIGHTENING OF THE FITTING.  THE LA HAZMAT TEAM LEADER REQUIRED THE CARGO TANK TO BE UNLOADED ON SITE BEFORE THE VEHICLE 1 COULD BE MOVED.  THIS TOOK OVER 4 HOURS FOR A TRANSPORT EQUIPPED WITH A PUMP TO BE LOCATED AND BROUGHT TO THE SITE AND ANOTHER 3 HOURS TO UNLOAD THE CARGO TANK.  BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE OF THE CARGO TANK ONLY 60% OF THE PRODUCT COULD BE REMOVED.  TWO WRECKERS AND A FOAM TRUCK FROM THE LAFAYETTE PARISH VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT WERE THEN USED TO UPRIGHT THE VEHICLE. THE ROADWAY WAS RE-OPENED AT 1730 HOURS.

(EERT) WAS REQUESTED BY TH ST. JOSEPH FIRE DEPARTMENT TO RESPOND TO THE CORNER OF NORTH 10TH STREET AND CHURCH STREET IN ST. JOSEPH, MISSOURI FOR A REPORTED CHLORINE SPILL.  THE SOURCE OF SPILL WAS THE RESULT OF DRIVER HITTING A TREE ON NORTH 10TH STREET.  THUS, RIPPING THE SIDE OF THE BOX TRUCK OPEN.  DURING, THE IMPACT OF THE ACCIDENT THE LOAD INSIDE THE TRUCK SHIFTED AND BREAKING OFF A VALVE OFF THE BOTTOM OF ONE TOTE CONTAINING THE CHEMICAL OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE SOLUTION, CAUSING A RELEASE OF CHEMICAL ONTO THE ROADWAY TRAVELING NORTH ON 10TH STREET TO A OPEN STORM DRAIN.  EERT ARRIVED ON THE SITE AT 18:25 HOURS, MET WITH THE CITY OF ST. JOSEPH FIRE DEPARTMENT AND TOLD THEM WHAT THE CHEMICAL WAS IN THE TRUCK. EERT MADE A VISUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE INCIDENT AND DETERMINED THAT THE CHEMICAL WAS TRAVELING ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS REPORTED TO AN OPEN STORM DRAIN, WHICH GOES DIRECTLY TO THE CITY OF ST. JOSEPH WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT.  EERT WAS INFORMED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT HAD ALREADY BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE RELEASE AND THAT WE WERE ON SITE AND WOULD DILUTE THE RELEASE.  EERT PERSONNEL MADE ENTRY INTO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK AND UPRIGHTED THE TOTE IN A POSITION THAT WOULD PREVENT ANY FURTHER CHEMICAL FROM LEAKING OUT OF THE TOTE.  THUS, CAUSING FURTHER CONTAMINATION ONTO THE CITY STREETS.  EERT OBSERVED THAT THE VALVE ON THE BOTTOM OF TOTE WAS SHEARED OFF FROM THE IMPACT ON THE TOTE CONTAINING THE CHEMICAL.  THE RESULT OF THE VALVE BEING SHEARED OFF CAUSED THE CHEMICAL TO DISCHARGE FROM THE TOTE.  EERT AFTER STOPPING THE LEAK AND SECURING THE REST OF THE LOAD ON THE TRUCK HAD EDWARD'S CHEMICAL PERSONNEL TRANSPORT THE TRUCK TO THEIR FACILITY ON MIDDLETON ROAD IN ST. JOSEPH, MISSOURI.  THIS WAS DONE WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CITY OF ST. JOSEPH POLICE DEPARTMENT.  EERT THEN BEGAN TO CLEAN UP THE STREET BY PLACING ABSORBENT MATERIAL ALONG THE PATH WHERE THE CHEMICAL WAS TRAVELING.
