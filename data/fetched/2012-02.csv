Upon further investigation, it was identified that there were 22 old 5-gallon poly pails of an antibacterial product (Chem Tron Pro Line DI-750) shipped from the generator to the Veolia facility in Flanders NJ.  It was believed that the pails were non-DOT specification because they were unused product still in the orginal packaging.  The pails were prepared for transportation by stacking them and securing them on a pallet with shrink-wrap.  While in-transit, the pails shifted, cracking the bottom of one pail, which resulted in releasing the contents.  All spilled liquid was contained in the trailer prior to remediation.",All pails must be inspected prior to transportation to determine if they are DOT specification or if they require overpacking into UN specification packaging.

The tank car was isolated and the shipper, BP Products North America, Inc. was notified via CHEMTREC, report 20120202-00162, Mr. Gregory Crum, BP Representative, 630-525-0102 was contacted. A CSXT HMS manager responded and found a strong odor and vapor leak at the manway nozzle, and the manway cover gasket between swing bolts 3 + 4. Upon opening the manway, excess product was found on the nozzle lip and gasket face preventing a proper seal. The nozzle lip and the gasket were cleaned off of excess product and the manway cover was re-seated and secured. Mr. Crum was notified of the conditions found and corrective actions taken. AMOX 13265 was released for disposition after inspection found no further odor or vapor release.     HMS Seal applied #1511.  This incident did require a special switch move at Avon Yard.  No AAR 7.1 form is required.

The bottom board of the top pallet caught a corner battery of the bottom pallet and pulled it through the shrink wrap, tipping it over onto the trailer floor, causing the fluid to leak out the top.  The battery was righted and a response crew was called.  They donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and used an absorbent material to contain the approximately 12 ounces that had spilled.  The absorbent and spill cleanup material were placed into a suitable salvage container and the battery was replaced on the pallet and resecured.

Upon inspection, Mgr. Lerch noted product had leaked down the sides of the car from the ""B"" end pressure relief valve, however the car was no longer actively leaking.  Further investigation revealed the car was shell full, and the pressure relief valve had activated previously to relieve internal pressure within the car. After determining cause of the release, arrangements were made to reduce the car load.  On 2-2-12 approximately 5460 gallons of product was reduced from the car into vacuum trucks.  Sides of the car were cleaned, and area impacted from the released product was remediated.  Car was secured and released to continue onto destination.

The closure plug on the closed liquid line valve was found emanating a slow product drip. This closure plug was not tool tight and reportedly could be turned by hand. Responders removed the closure plug, cleaned the threaded area, applied Teflon tape to the threads, reinserted the plug and properly tool tightened it. Afterwards, no further product dripping was observed. The small amount of observed spillage was wiped.

Incident Date: 2/8/2012  Incident# 1002480    SUMMARY OF EVENTS: Driver loaded  7,524 gallons of (Dyed Diesel) Fuel for delivery into the facility dyed-diesel above ground storage tank (AST). Upon arrival, driver determined from tank gauge that there was 9"" or 486 gallons of product on-hand and as the (AST) capacity is 18,000 gallons (90%= 16,200) that the load of 7,524 gallons would fit.  As delivery requires use of tractor  pump;driver made connections from the trailer compartment(s) to the tractor pump lines to the receiving line of facility dyed diesel tank and initiated the pump-off of the product into the AST.  The dyed diesel receiving line at the bulk facility, that connects to the AST, also shares connection to the top loading mechanism at the load rack.    It was determined that the dyed diesel load arm valve, on the load rack, was left blocked open by one of the facilities tank wagon drivers.   As such, the load arm valve, being left in an open position, allowed fuel to gravity out of the load rack top loading arm and into the dike area of the load rack. The spilled product was contained within the earthen berm I concrete walled dike area contingent  to the load rack.    Initial report  from driver to operations staff was that a spillage of up to 2,100 gallons had occurred,as driver had been unloading a trailer compartment that had 2,100 of product  when he noticed the fuel was spilling out of the load arm at the load rack. Initial reports  were filed with the Kentucky EPA, Kentucky Waste Management and National Response Center indicating a spill of approximately 2,100  gallons had occurred and that it was contained within the earthen/concrete dike area of the facility.  Our localoperations group responded to site and were able to use one of our tank wagon trucks to pump the product out of the dike area. The product  that was pumped out of the dike was transferred into a 1,000 gallon skid tank (AST) at the site. Staff then proceeded to calculate product  spillage and determined that an amount  of 644 gallons was actually spilled- not the 2,100 gallons that was first perceived.  We then re-contacted the Kentucky EPA and NRC and advised that the initial gallons of 2,100 was inaccurate and that the spill was between 600 and 700 gallons (644). The EPA acknowledged the change in gallons. The NRC advised they could not change the gallons from what was previously reported.    Adam Fritsch of the Kentucky Division of Waste Management responded to site and directed the need to have the soil under and around the load rack area as well as clean up of any residuals in or around the concrete wall dike area to be completed that day. We retained the services of Ernest Mc Comas to respond with staff and equipment and excavate and clean up the areas as directed by Mr. Fritsch. Upon completion of these activities, Mr. Fritsch advised the clean-up had been completed to his satisfaction. The soil, absorbents (pads/booms) were","POST INCIDENT REVIEW REFLECTED THAT OUR TRANSPORT DRIVER HAD ARRIVED AT DELIVERY LOCATION, MADE PROPER CALCULATIONS TO DETERMINE THAT THE RECEIVING TANK WOULD ACCEPT THE TENDERED LOAD, MADE PROPER CONNECTIONS TO THE UNLOADING LINES AND INTIATED THE PUMP-OFF DELIVERY PROCESS. THE PRODUCT LINES AT THE FACILITY ARE OF A SHARED NATURE; IN THAT THE SAME LINE CONNECTED TO THE STORAGE TANK ALSO FEEDS THE LOADING RACK AT THE BULK FACILITY. THERE IS A VALVE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LOAD RACK AREA THAT CONTROLS FLOW TO THE LOADING RACK. TRANSPORT DRIVER WAS UNAWARE THAT THE VALVE TO THE LOADING RACK HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN BY ONE OF THE TANK WAGON DRIVERS THAT WORK OUT OF THE BULK FACILITY. THIS VALVE BEING LEFT IN THE OPEN POSITION ALLOWED PRODUCT TO GRAVITY OUT OF TH ELOAD ARM AT THE LOADING RACK - DURING SAME TIME PRODUCT WAS BEING OFF-LOADED INTO THE STORAGE TANK; RESULTING IN THE PRODUCT SPILLAGE. VALVES WERE DETERMINED TO BE IN PROPER OPERATING CONDITION. VALVE BEING LEFT IN AN OPEN POSITION WAS A HUMAN ERROR.     WE ADDRESSED, WITH THE TRANSPORT DRIVER, THE ISSUE OF FOLLOWING ""ALL"" PRODUCT LINES AT A FACILITY AND THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY VALVES THAT MAY BE PRESENT, SUCH AS IN THIS CASE ON A COMMON LINE, MUST BE IN THE OFF POSITION UNLESS IT IS THE VAVLE LEADING DIRECTLY TO THE RECEIVING TANK. WE HAVE ALSO HAD DISCUSSION WITH THE PERSONNEL AT THE BULK PLANT THAT THEY MUST FOLLOW THEIR PROCEDURES THAT ALL VALVES FROM THE STORAGE TANKS TO THE LOADING RACK AREA MUST BE MAINTAINED IN A CLOSED POSITION EXCEPT DURING THEIR LOADING PROCESS AND THAT ONCE THYE HAVE COMPLETED LOADING THEY MUST TURN THE VALVE LEADING TO THE LOADING RACK BACK TO THE OFF/CLOSED POSITION.    PROPER LOADING AND UNLOADING PROCEDURES ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CLASSROOM AND FIELD TRAINING WITH A DRIVER TRAINER FOR ALL HIRED DRIVER EMPLOYEES. EACH DRIVER RECEIVES A COPY OF OUR IN-DEPTH DRIVER TRAINING MANUEL. WE HAVE ONGOING QUARTERLY SAFETY AND OPERATIONAL MEETINGS WITH ALL OF OUR DRIVER PERONNEL.

The blue shrink wrap completely covered the damaged area. No damage to the shrink wrap. Who ever applied the shrink wrap covered the damage. I can only guess why that was done. Maybe it was not leaking at the time. I lean towards the opinion that it was covered up in order to move the freight to the next location. Pass the spill report to somebody else. The smell of paint was overpowering. Its hard for me to believe that it was never noticed.     The damage could have occurred by a forklift, but it could have also been by a pallet falling over, the pallet is was consolidated on or another pallet falling over onto it. It could have been caused by the trailer wall or D-rings.      The biggest issue I have with this situation is that the damage looked like it was hidden by somebody with fresh shrink wrap.

The overfilled tank was not identified immediately.  A construction worker reported the overfilled tank about 2 hours after the truck was unloaded.      Fuel tank delivery of fuel oil was pumped in Unit 6 fuel oil storage tank and overfilled the tank.  The storage tank has an high and a high high set point to alarm in the controlroom.   Prior to unloading the fuel tank the station operator verified the tank would hold the quantity based on the control room readings and the set points.  The fuel truck was unloaded by the driver with a Duke operator overseeing the unloading process.  Approximately 2 hours later it was discovered that the fuel tank was overfilled.  A construction craft personnel walked by the fuel tank secondary containment and smelt fuel oil.   They climbed the stairs over the secondary containment wall and noticed fuel oil in the secondary containment.   The control room was notified of the fuel oil in the secondary containment.  Operations and Shaw estimated that the volume was around 850 gallons of fuel that was in the secondary containment around the fuel oil storage tank.   The fuel oil was pumped into totes and moved to a second tank onsite.  The area was cleaned up.      The set points for the high level was 22.0 ft and the high high was 22.5 ft.   The tank overflowed at 21.85 ft.   The alarm setpoints will be lowered to below 21.85 to prevent the storage tank from being overfilled.  The Unit 6 fuel oil storage tank is 136,000 gallons.   One tank truck shipment is 7,500 gallons and increases the tank volume by 1.07 ft.  This was the first time the tank was filled this full.    The secondary containment with diesel fuel was cleaned up by the site.  The carrier did not consider this a DOT Incident.  However, the receiver does and is submitting this DOT Incident report with the information that it has gathered.  While the carrier was on-site, the fuel tank was overfilled due to the receiver's tank settings being set incorrectly.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Chemtrade Logistics, was notified through their emergency response center.  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the cause of the release was due to deteriorated threads on the liquid line closure cap to the extent that the cap cannot be secured.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to Chemtrades representative.  On February 7th, contractor personnel replaced the defective cap to secure the container.

Halliburton driver turned left onto Coffey/Shiloh Rd. The trailer tracked to the left of tractor causing the rear axle to drop off of roadway. This resulted in the tractor and trailer overturning into the adjacent ditch. Approximately 62 gallons of 28% Hydrochloric Acid leaked into ditch through the manway of the transport. Local Fire Dept and Hazmat Response Crews isolated the incident scene by a 0.5 mile radius, and would not allow for other response personnel to report to the scene for approximately 2 hours until the Hazmat crew evaluated and cleared the scene. After Local authorities released the scene, Halliburton tightened the manway bolts and isolated the leak. Contents from the leak were contained by a land berm in the ditch. Acid was neutralized and remediated by Allied International Emergency.","Corrective actions have been implemented to improve journey management and ensure drivers are following designated routes, with proper escorts leading drivers to their destination.

Driver was assisted by a receiving agent who attended the delivery with the driver throughout the unloading process.  When the meter amount had been delivered, the driver cleared his product hoses and the receivers line into the receiving tank.  At this point, the receiving agent went to the tank and discovered the apparent overflow.  The driver and receiving agent determined approx., 10-20 gallons had overflowed into containment.     The receiving tank was approx., 80 feet from the unloading area.  The driver had no visual of the tank because it is located between 2 larger tanks which blocked his view. Past practice at this location was to have 2 receiving agents present during the unloading process. One would stay at the tank and monitor it's level and the second would stay with the driver. This delivery only had one receiver present at the time.  At the conclusion of delivery, the driver blew out the hose lines thus causing the product tank to overflow into containment.

Approximately one-gallon of free product was released as a result of the incident.  Hazchem Environmental Corporation of Addison, Illinois was dispatched to perform the cleanup and oversee the unloading of the remainder of the product.  Hazchem Environmental wiped down the tanker as needed and placed absorbent pads around the leaking valve to catch the free liquid.  The remainder of the product was unloaded without incident.

GATX 38 was cordoned off in the railyard. After an initial BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder's inspection of GATX 38, it was deemed safe to move and isolated in the railyard. Contract responders were summoned. Responders reported the leak source at the liquid line's threaded closure cap that was not tool tight. The closure cap was tightened, stopping further product release. After GATX 38 was depressurized, the liquid line cap was removed to inspect the cap's interior gasket condition. The responders reported the cap gasket appeared worn/deteriorated. Responders added gasket material within the cap to ensure a good seal after the closure cap was reapplied and tool tightened. Spillage on GATX 38's exterior was neutralized with a soda ash solution. A small area of spillage that impacted the ground was neutralized in place. Response was concluded by 1800 hrs.

Description:  Container PONU1289228, February 23, 2012    A container was in line to be inspected when an employee noted that it was leaking. The Port Fire Department  was notified and requested to confirm if product or water. They confirmed it was product. Absorbent was placed down and the owner notified. Subsequently, the container was taken to a secure area of the terminal and a containment  system was put around it to capture any additional leakage. The container was opened and found to have poor blocking and bracing materials. Some drums appeared to be slightly off the pallet and were double stacked. All of the contents were removed and checked. Some of the drums appeared to be over filled and had pressurized. The drums were plastic composition. In total four 55-gallon drums in the container leaked resulting in a loss of approximately  118 gallons of product:two drums had minor leaks and two burst losing their entire contents.    At the onset of the incident, a courtesy report was made to the NRC as only  8 gallons appeared to have leaked onto the surrounding  concreted work area. A later assessment determined that 118 gallons had leaked from four drums inside the container but only a fraction of this amount escaped the container. The amount leaked did not meet the RQ in CERCLA nor Title 49. The product did not get into any waterways or storm drains. The leakage was effectively  contained and the container isolated for handling.    As a precaution, the area where the container was first stored was checked for evidence of leakage. It was discovered that the container had leaked and contaminated  four other containers. The area was cleaned by a contractor (M&M Environmental)  and the four affected containers were taken to a secure area for inspection and cleaning.

Telephone notification was made to NRC when incident occurred, so I am following up with this report.    Driver was loaded and WB on CR-38 when he departed prepared surface, lost control of vehicle, and struck a utility pole.  As vehicle continued on uncontrolled, it struck a natural gas supply pipe.  Sparks from the electrical wires on the utility pole ignited the natural gas escaping from the gas main starting a fire which involved both tractor and trailer within 5 minutes.  Vehicle was rolled partially over, but driver escaped by kicking out the windshield and egressing tractor cab.  Environmental Management  Services was called (by HAZMAT ONE) to the scene for mitigation and clean-up, various municipal fire departments responded, but fire was too hot to approach the vehicles, and decision was made to let fire burn itself out.  CR-38 was closed in both directions during the event, and Columbia Gas responded and attempted to isolate the gas line, but this took several hours.  Fire crews decided not to attempt to extinguish the fire until the gas main could be secured.  During this time, tractor, trailer and cargo were completely involved in fire, and most of the cargo was incinerated.  Appx 25-30 gallons seeped onto an embankment to a small drainage ditch, but EMS isolated the spill with absorbent socks.  Gas main was eventually secured, fire extinguished, and vehicle carcasses removed.  No waterways were impacted.  Environmental Management Services returned the following two days to excavate, remove and remediate the soil under the crash site.","Driver was 4.5 hours into his DOT day, and adamantly stated that he did not fall asleep.  CR-38 is a relatively narrow road, and driver states that he moved over slightly right to allow an oncoming vehicle a bit more room as they closed. In doing so, tractor tires departed prepared surface, but driver was able to regain control for a few seconds, but when trailer tires went off the road, momentum pulled the entire vehicle into the ditch. I do not believe that fatigue was a factor in this crash.    We have analyzed and reviewed this crash, and have determined that CR-38, while legally able to support class 8 vehicle traffic, and is the most direct route between origin and destination, is not a preferred route of travel for class 8 vehicles. GPS recorded speeds prior to the crash were: 46 and 47 MPH.  We have prohibited our drivers from using this route and stipulated that they use US-224 and OH 53 to and from this destination.

A deer was reportedly in the roadway, and the driver swerved to avoid colliding with the deer.  The driver lost control of the vehicle, which then left the roadway to the right and overturned.  Gasoline was released from the damaged cargo tank (tank trailer) and a fire ensued, further damaging the vehicle and tank trailer.  Due to fire damage, the size and location of initial holes in the tank trailer could not be determined.  The vehicle and tank trailer were essentially destroyed.  Local fire departments responded to the scene and constructed berms to contain the release.  Fire fighting foam was applied to extinguish the fire. Once the fire was extinguished, residual liquids were pumped from the tank trailer, and the vehicle wreckage was removed from the scene.  Environmental assessment and remediation activities commenced immediately.  The release incident was reported via telephone to the National Response Center.  Phillips Recoveries was hired as the remediation contractor.  Highlands Environmental Solutions, Inc. was retained by the insurance provider to oversee site remediation activities and perform necessary reporting.  Petroleum-impacted soil was excavated from the field that was impacted by the petroleum release. Post-excavation confirmation samples were collected from the excavated area for laboratory analysis to confirm the success of remediation efforts. The excavated area was backfilled, and the ground surface was seeded to prevent erosion.

INTERVIEW WITH JAMES W. FLEMING    DRIVER OF BOB-TAIL TRUCK THAT EXPLODED    On Monday, February 06, 2012 at 1:30 p.m. I conducted an interview with James W. Fleming at Landmark Service Co-op in Whitewater, WI.  The following information was obtained:    Started working with Cooperative Plus in May 2008 as a Propane Sales & Delivery person.  He was considered a Seasonal Driver.  On Jan 11, 2009 he was promoted to LP Driver and Location Energy Manager.    In Oct of 2011 there was a merger of Cooperative Plus with Landmark Services Co-op.  They are headquartered in Burlington, WI and have offices in E. Troy and Clinton.    On Friday, Feb. 3, 2012 an LP gas incident occurred at approximately 3:10 p.m.  Mr. Fleming had been in the process of filling his Bob-tail truck with LP gas, when a gas leak occurred and a vapor ignition took place.  In short order the relief valve on the tank truck opened and fire went skyward.  This was followed by a BLEVE of the Bob-tail tank.    Mr. Fleming provided the following information regarding his work day on 2/3/12:  • Reported to work at 7:00 a.m. and was the first one there.  • Checked his e-mails and downloaded info to his laptop computer.  • Completed paper work until 8:00 a.m.  • Started to fill his 2006 Kenworth truck, topping it off from almost empty.  • Backed the truck up to a sign and parked.  • Opened the fence gates which were padlocked.  • Opened cabinet and turned on the vapor valve.  • Took cap off the liquid line and put liquid line on truck and tightened with a spanner wrench, then opened both valves on hose and truck.  He then went back and got vapor line and hooked it up with a pipe wrench and opened the valves on it.  • Pulled up the emergency levers.  • Turned the pump on with on/off swithch  • Cherked the pressure on the tank and opened properly.  • Normal fill time is approx 40 to 45 minutes.  • Shut off the pump   • Flipped down the emergency valves and turned off the valves.  • Relieved the pressure on the liquid line for approx a minute.  • Opened the hose and dumped liquid on the ground.  • Completed the vapor line first.  • Now ready for delivery of auto fills and call-ins.    Returned back to yard at noon for a second load of LP.  Refilled Bob-tail and went back out on more deliveries.    At approx. 2:30 p.m. he returned back to the yard and started to fill, or top off his truck for Sat. morning run.  The incident happened at approx 3:10 p.m.   • The truck was shut off while he went into the office to talk with the IT man  • He was done filling his truck by 3:00 p.m.  • The vapor line was disconnected and hanging up.  • The liquid line was still connected while he was getting the spanner wrench.  • He was at the rear of his truck with his back to the bulk tank when he heard a lowed clap sound.  It was very distinguishable.  Then he heard a metallic sound hitting someth","True cause of failure has yet to be determined.  Investigators from potential interested parties are working on determining whether a valve failed or fitting at bulkhead failed, or both.      All propane drivers have gone through DOT Hazmat Refresher training subsequant to the incident, and the system will be rebuilt to NFPA 58, 2011 Edition standards.",Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,708400,Landamrk Logistics Inc.,US,

THE FLAMES WERE EXTINGUISHED AND EXCAVATION OF THE CONTAMINED SOIL BEGAN. I DISCUSSED THE WORK WITH CHRIS MANY AND EAN JOSEPHSON OF PENNDOT. THEY SAID THAT THE MEDIAN DOES NOT HAVE A GEO-SYNTHETIC CLAY LINER BUT ALL DITCHES ARE LINED. DENNIS WOLFE LATER ARRIVED AND WE USED PIDS TO HELP DETERMINE WHERE THE CONTAMINATION WAS CONCENTRATED AND THE EXTENT OF THE EXCAVATION REQUIRED. EAGLE ALSO SUBCONTRACTED MOUNTAIN RESEARCH TO USE A HYDRAULIC GEO-PROBE TO TAKE CORE SAMPLES (5) AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE SPILL. THE MEDIAN CONSISTED OF 6-12 INCHES OF SOIL OVER FRACTURED LIMESTONE ROCK, SOME OF WHICH WAS >3 FEET IN DIAMETER. THE GASOLINE FLOWED THROUGH THE SOIL INTO THE LARGE VOIDS BETWEEN THESE ROCKS. THERE APPEARED TO BE A SINKHOLE IN THE SWALE WHICH MAY HAVE ALLOWED EASIER ASSCESSES TO THIS LAYER. EAGLE EXCAVATED UP TO 8 FEET AND WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAMINATION. WE DETERMINED THAT THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION FOR TODAY WAS TO REMOVE THE UPPER SOIL TO EXPOSE THE LARGE ROCKS AND ENCOURAGE VOLATILIZATION OF THE GASOLINE. THE PIT WILL BE OPEN THROUGH THE WEEKEND (PROTECTED BY ORANGE CONSTRUCTION FENCING) AND WILL LIKELY BE BACKFILLED NEXT WEEK.  THE LIMITS OF THE EXCAVATION APPEARS TO BE LIMITED TO THE MEDIAN. THROUGHOOUT THE DAY, I CHECKED THE CLOSEST WATERWAY (UNT TO BUFFALO RUN) BUT DID NOT SEE ANY INDICATION THAT THE FUEL TRAVELED THAT FAR.  AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, I INSTALLED A BOOM DOWNSTREAM OF THE ACCIDENT TO CAPTURE ANY FUEL THAT MAY LEACH OUT OF THE GROUND. DENNIS WOLFE WILL BE THE PRIMARY CONTACT FOR THE REMEDIATION OF THE SITE. SHERYL SINCLAIR AND JESSICA RITENOUR (DEP GEOLOGISTS) WERE ALSO ONSITE INVESTIGATING THE ACCIDENT.
