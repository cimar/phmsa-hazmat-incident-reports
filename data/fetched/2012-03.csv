Guam A.F.Base (PGUA) to Misawa A.F.Base, (RJSM)     The flight crew phone patched the company's operations center reporting a spill,  apparent residual fuel, in an ULD containing an exposed F16 replacement tank.  The in-flight mechanic contained an approximate 0.25L of the substance and once in the ground he proceeded to clean / decontaminate the pallet and surrounding area accordingly. Adjacent ULDs, aircraft floor, roller tracks and power drive units were also checked for possible contamination and cleaned respectively. The aircraft was then release by him to continue in service.  The aircraft was not declared under emergency at any time during this event.  NRC and FAA were also notified on situation as early as practicable.  It has been determined that the residual fuel may have been leaked through an unsecured cap on the “presumed empty” tank when exposed to conditions normally encountered in air transport. Also note that it was reported the tanks were exposed to heavy rain sometime before the flight; however, we could not verify is inclement weather could have be a contributing factor for this event.","The USAF base staff, through its applicable Air Terminal Manager, GS -12 Charles Kucharski, was notified on the event.   We have been advised that during the joint inspection process the inspector asked the unit for tank transport status,  i.e. if there was fuel in the PODS, and it was  stated the PODS were empty. Unfortunately the joint inspector may have failed to verify if fuels were in the tank and consequently the DD Form 2133 joint inspection form was not accurately completed.   The unit has been briefed to ensure the process is clearly adhered to and that any applicable check is confirmed before all blocks, that are applicable on the DD Form 2133, are properly completed.     The company has also briefed our direct staff member at base to ensure the USAF process is followed and to visually double check all replacement tanks despite being offered as empty / purged.     We are confident that this has been and unintentional overlook and that there was no intention to offer such a tank with a residual. Despite this believe, the USAF decertified the joint inspector who performed the joint inspection in question. USAF also notified the re-deploying unit and they are taken appropriate actions on their personnel as well.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),ZZ,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Atlas Air,US,

Car is loaded with hexane.  Car was on south end of long 6 track in Shreveport, LA.  No injuries were reported.  All concerned have been notified.    Carl Akins, KCS, was already at the Shreveport Yard so he began to do an initial research and PPE selection for response to the Hexane commodity. Mr. Akins also called response partner,to inform him of situation. Mr. Akins arrived on the scene at 4:45 p.m. and Mike arrived five minutes later. The Shreveport Terminal Director assisted KCS with getting the appropriate tracks locked out.    It was observed that a steady trickle of liquid coming from the car at a rate of about 20 ounces per minute coming from the protective housing. After opening the protective housing KCS found the flange on the liquid line to be improperly secured. Two of the bolts were less than hand tight. After wrench tightening the bolts, the leak was mitigated. The leak was stopped at approximately 5:15 p.m. LA State Police Officer Jay Hardy arrived on the scene at approximately 5:20 p.m. He climbed onto the car and was briefed on the leak situation and the  mitigation. The protective housing was closed and a new security seal was installed.    The car was released at 5:45 p.m.    File Note: Item 19 - the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27 - Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

BNSF responders depressurized GATX 6326 ending the product release at the liquid line's closure cap area. Inspection of the liquid line closure cap revealed it was approx. 1/4 turn passed hand tight. GATX 6326 deemed safe to move and it was isolated in the railyard for further inspection by shipper representatives to determine root cause of this release. Shipper representative inspected GATX 6326 and reported that the liquid eduction pipe threads were 'somewhat coarse', thus providing a pathway for product under pressure to escape from the threaded liquid eduction line's threaded connection at the closure cap.  The closure cap's gasket was in a serviceable condition. The closure cap was tool tightened to approx. 1 1/2 to 2 turns passed hand tight. Product spillage on the tank shell was neutralized with baking soda and no ground spillage was reported.","The shipper is initiating measures to eliminate future like occurrences.

Driver of truck got over to allow as much room as possible using the berm and applied the brakes.The car continued its path and struck the truck on drivers side in front of the rear wheels, causing the left side of truck to leave the road surface. The momentum caused the truck to roll 3 times coming to rest on its wheels and with the tank still attached but resting 90 degrees to its normal mounting, over a drainage ditch. The integrity of the tank was not compromised, however the piping between truck and tank broke allowing fuel into drainage ditch, onto the already flowing small amount of water from field runoff. Fire company personel arrived within 5 minutes and put booms and pads in the ditch and on the top of water stopping the flow of oil within 50 feet of the origin.

BRETZ,CORPORATE SECRETARY,3766 Sharon-New Castle Rd.,West Middlesex,PA,16159,Carrier,"The unit was traveling on a two lane road at 50-55 mph. As the unit traveled over the crest of a hill, he observed 5 oncoming vehicles. The 5th vehicle, a pickup truck, began to pass the other 4 vehicles, all cars. Our unit began to brake, seeing the distance to short for the pickup to pass safely. The pickup made no attempt to slow down or return to it's lane. Our driver noticed noticed the pickup's windshield was frosted and the driver's ability to see was limited. Our driver then applied maximum braking and edged to the berm to avoid a head-on collision. The pickup moved slightly over towards the other vehicles it was passing.It hit our unit in the left front causing the collision. Our unit was slowed to 30-35 mph at the point of impact. Due to the sudden surge of the liquid and loss of the left steer tire, our unit rolled onto it's right side across the roadway. The pickup was totaled, but the driver uninjured. Our driver was injured, but exited the vehicle. He was able to give valuable information to first responders and police as product was leaking from the manhole area. The EMA on sight coordinator stated that the lid was secure, but it was leaking from the hinge area of the lid due to the structural damage of the tank. A backhoe was brought in to create small ponds to contain the product leaking onto the roadway and traveling into a wooded area as advised by our driver. The NRC, DEP, & PEMA were notified. The product was contained in these small ponds. It was covered with plastic to prevent being disturbed until it cooled and solidified. The product was left in place for 3 days as it posed no threat to the environment. It was then removed with a limited amount of soil. The area affected was restored to it's natural state. The property owner stated it looked better than before the spill. The duration of the release was approximately 5 1/2 hours. That was about 617 gallons per hour or 10.3 gallons per minute. The actions taken by all first responders and the recovery personnel throughout the duration of the incident, are to be commended. Communication was also a key factor. After the cleanup and restoration, soil samples were taken and sent for testing .","Our company trains our drivers with the latest training materials provided by J.J. Keller, PERS, and various other sources. We utilize online training tools and hands on material. Compliance is a never ending process. The safety of our drivers and other motorists who we share public roadways with, is our is our main priority. To always expect the unexpected is most important, even when a driver is faced with an unavoidable head on collision by fault of another vehicle. Split decisions by drivers absolutely determine what the end result will be. Even with the extreme force of the rollover to the structure of the tank trailer, the shell, though severely damaged, remained in tact. The product leaked through the dome lid hinge area and a limited amount through the vent assembly, which has no way of being closed. Since this incident, I have contacted E.D. ETNYRE, the manufacturer, requesting they construct an emergency shut off valve which could be closed to prevent product loss through the vent assembly in the event of a rollover. This area is already protected by a rollover protection box. Their engineers have devised a way to install such a valve. We are currently having these valves installed on our new purchases, and will eventually make the same updates to our current fleet. This procedure will help prevent product from escaping through the vent system. Due to the temperature on average of 300 plus degrees, these tank trailers require constant ventilation to prevent damage from expansion and contraction. We hope to never have the need for this valve, but knowing that it is in place, can only be a positive result.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,119727,"Erie Enterprises, Inc.",US,

COMPLIANCE",7150 PHILIPS HWY,Jacksonville,FL,32256,Carrier,"On 3/29/2012, at approximately 12:35, SWS Environmental was contacted by Matt Borchert of Florida East Coast Railway. At this time, Matt requested response to a tank car containing a residual amount of Ethyl Alcohol,that was seeping a small amount of product from the bottom outlet. SWS responded with two personnel, and after participating in a safety briefing and confirming track protection, inspected the car further.    Upon inspection of the car (ACFX 200152), we did not observe any obvious damage or vandalism, that would impact the serviceability of the car. We did observe moisture around the top of the bottom outlet cap, but it did not appear that the rate at which the product seeped out, was greater than the rate that it volatized in the open air. SWS did not witness product impacting any surface other than the cap itself.    FEC advised us that their personnel did tighten the bottom outlet cap with a pipe wrench, and did snug the top operated bottom valve as well. SWS personnel deployed absorbent padding beneath the bottom outlet as a precautionary measure, and using a five gallon pail to capture material, removed the bottom outlet cap. Once removed, approximately six to eight ounces of product fell into the bucket. When the cap was removed, all residual moisture around the thread and valve quickly dried up. The cap did not have a gasket installed and it is not known to us (SWS)if that particular cap was designed to have a gasket, and if so, whether or not a gasket would have prevented the seepage. We were able to look up into the bottom outlet and did not see any damage or obstruction that would prevent the valve from operating properly.    The bottom outlet valve was replaced and tightened with a pipe wrench. We then transferred the product captured in the pail, back into the car via the man way. When opening the man way cover, we did release a fair amount of pressure. The inside of the car looked to be in good condition, free of any obvious damage or decay. The man way cover was then closed and secured, and made tool tight with a pipe wrench.    The bottom outlet was then re-inspected and found not to be releasing product. It could be speculated, that with the valve not snug, and pressure building in the car,that product and/or vapor was forced into the loose cap, resulting in the moisture that was discovered today. It could also be speculated that with the pressure vented, the valve snugged, and the cap tightened, that the risk of reoccurrence has been reduced and/or removed.    Matt, The FRA contacted us once we returned to the shop and asked some questions about what we observed and the services we provided. He requested a short summary as well. With your permission, we can forward the above narrative to him, if that makes it easier for you.    While it is unfortunate that this occurred, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to work for you. We look forward to scheduling the track maintenance we discussed on site.

She told Mr. Yost that upon arrival two batteries were identified as being tipped over in the back of the trailer.  Mr. Yost spoke to the driver (Mr. Melton)  and authorized him to move his tractor and directed him to use his spill kit containing kitty litter and baking powder to cover the drips in the parking lot so traffic would not drive through the acid and spread the contamination.    At 9:54 Mr. Yost contacted Mr. Melton and was informed that he had been required to park next to a drain and that he was running out of spill supplies.  Mr. Yost spoke to him and told him that dirt could be used to make a berm to prevent entry into the storm drain.  The driver was able to use a piece of flat metal to gather soil and make a berm.  Mr.Yost explained to Mr. Melton that the ETA of the response contractor would be a little over three hours.    At 12:15 Mr. Wright of Con-way Transportation  contacted Mr. Yost and informed him that he had spoken to his customer and that Mr. Yost was to leave the four batteries on the trailer after they and the trailer had been deconned.    At 13:37 the response contractor arrived on site and determined  the small acid release was container.  Since Caterpillar would not let them use their dock and fork lift the response contractor had to rent local equipment to upright the batteries and secure them to the sides of the trailer.  Each battery weighed an estimated 1600 pounds.    At 17:42 SWS staff were back on site and had placed the hoist into the trailer.    At 19:11 three of the batteries had been moved and secured in a clean area of the trailer.  Both of the batteries which had been laying on their side were not damaged.  Sulfuric acid had only been leaking from the top fill caps on the battery.  Both of these batteries were wrapped in plastic an secured to the side of the trailer with ratchet straps.    The small amount of neutralize acid, broken boards from the pallets, and soil were placed into one 55-gallon drum and taken off site for disposal.",The load shift which caused the batteries to tip over was caused by a hard braking event to avoid an accident.  The batteries were packaged securely and during routine transportation  cirsumstances  would have been sufficient to secure the load.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7500,"CON-WAY TRUCKLOAD, INC.",US,

After looking closer at the tank car he discovered liquid dripping from the flange below the primary valve on the rail tank car. Rail tank car # NTLX 1063 contained Propyl Acetate (Hazard Class 3).  A catch pan was immediately placed under the flange to catch additional drips of the hazardous material. It is estimated than less than a gallon of Propyl Acetate was released. The railcar had arrived at the Charlotte GP TRANSFLO terminal on January 20th, 2012 and was not leaking during initial inspection or subsequent inspections. No product had been offloaded from the railcar since its arrival at the TRANSFLO terminal. Inspections by RESCAR and the CSX Hazardous Material division determined that the railcar had a defective Jamesbury bottom outlet valve. The 1 "" securement nuts were tightened to slow the release but this did not completely stop the product drip. RESCAR was unable to repair the bottom outlet valve so the shipper arranged for the product to be offloaded into trailers to remove product from railcar and stop the release of product. Shipper (Oxea Corporation) has applied for an FRA movement approval to forward the railcar with product residue to another location for repairs.","All employees were re-trained on visual inspection of all equipment, fittings, and railcars.

THAT LOCATION WAS CAPRON MFG, CAPRON, IL. OUR DRIVER INFORMED US THAT THE IBC HAD RUPTURED. THE IBC WAS LOADED FOUR FEET FROM THE TAIL OF THE TRAILER. IT CONTAINED A CORROSIVE CLEANING COMPOUND(NA 1760). THE CRACK WAS APPROXIMATELY SIX TO EIGHT INCHES LONG AND WAS LOCATED AT THE TOP SIDE OF THE PLASTIC BOTTLE. ALL ALUMINUM SUPPORT BARS ON THE TOP AND SIDES OF THE IBC HAD SNAPPED. (SEE PHOTOS), IT WS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 40 GALLONS HAD SPILLED FROM THIS 330 GALLON IBC. THIS IBC WAS SECURED WITH A LOAD BAR, AND HAD SIMILAR PRODUCT LOADED ALONG SIDE OF IT IN BLUE PLASTIC 55 GALLON DRUMS.     THE SHIPMENT WAS PICKED UP ON 3/28/12 IN INDIANAPOLIS, IN. IT WAS LINEHAULED IN THAT TRAILER FROM INDIANAPOLIS TO NEENAH., WISCONSIN WHERE THE IBC WAS DOCKED AND THEN RELOADED ON TO ANOTHER TRAILER.    NM TRANSFER HAD SOME RECENT HISTORY OF PACKAGES LEAKING WITH THIS SHIPPER. AS A RESULT, WE BEGAN TAKING PHOTOS OF THESE BULK PACKAGES THROUGH OUT THEIR ARRIVALS WITHIN OUR TRANSPORTATION NETWORK. THIS IBC WAS PHOTOGRAPHED UPON DEPARTURE FROM OUR BREAKBULK TERMINAL IN NEENAH, WI. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND OF DAMAGE TO THE IBC BEFORE IT WAS LOADED OUT. THE DRIVER ALSO VERIFIED WITH ME THAT THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ANY LEAKAGE OF DAMAGE WHEN HE VIEWED THE IBC ON THE TAIL OF THIS TRAILER AT NEENAH, WI.     THE CUSTOMER WAS NOT ABLE TO REMOVE THE IBC FROM THE BACK OF THE TRAILER BECAUSE OF THE RISK INVOLVED WITH FURTHER MOVEMENT. N&M TRANSFER NOTIFIED OUR INSURANCE CARRIER TO LOCATE AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPANY FOR US. THEY CONTACTED S.E.T. ENVIRONMENTAL OUT OF WHEELING, ILLINOIS. S.E.T. RESPONDED WITH A CREW OF FOUR PEOPLE AND THREE VEHICLES WITH EQUIPMENT. THE LEAKING IBC WAS DRAINED AT THE SPILL SITE AND REFILLED IN TO TWO NEW IBC'S. SATURATED CLEAN UP MATERIALS FROM THE SPILL SITE WERE PLACED IN A DRUM FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL. THE ASPHAL GROUND SURFACE WAS CLEANED UP, AS WELL AS THE TRAILER FLOOR. AT LEAST TWO SHIPMENTS LOADED IN FRON AND TO THE SIDE OF THIS IBC WERE SPLATTERED WITH THE CORROSIVE CLEANING COMPOUND. THE SPILL SITE WAS REMOVED OF ALL VEHICLES AT APPRXIMATELY 3:40 PM.","AT THE TIME THIS REPORT WAS BEING WRITTEN, EXPERTS WERE STILL BREING CONSULTED AS TO THE CAUSE OF THIS RUPTURE. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY STACKING OF ANY KIND OF FREIGHT ON THIS IBC. STAKING OF FREIGHT ON TOP OF IBC'S IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED BY OUR COMPANY POLICY. THE INSPECTION MARKS NOTED BY THE SHIPPER AND A DATE STAMPON THE PLASTIC WHITE BOTTLE INDICATES THAT THE TOTE WAS MANUFACTURED IN MARCH OF 2012, HOWEVER, BY APPEARANCE, THE IBC LOOKS MUCH OLDER THAN THAT.    PART 178.707 INDICATES THE FOLLOWING: ""COMPOSITE IBC'S INTENDED FOR THE TRANSPORATION OF LIQUIDS MUST BE CAPABLE OF RELEASING A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF VAPOR TO PREVENT THE BODY OF THE IBC FROM RUPTURING IF IT IS SUBJECTED TO AN INTERNAL PRESSURE IN EXCESS OF THAT FOR WHICH IT WAS HYDRAULICALLY TESTED. THIS POTENTION CAUSE NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT FURTHER.     ANOTHER BULK PACKAGE EXPERT WE HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH REGARDING THIS INCIDENT MADE THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ABOUT COMPOSITE IBC'S.""   ""WE HAVE TESTED IBC'S BEFORE AND SEE SIMILAR FAILURES DURING THE BOUNCE VIBRATION TEST REQUIRED FOR UN DOT CERTIFICATION FOR HAZARD MATERIAL PACKAGING. MY BEST GUESS IS THAT THE TRAILER RESONATED (BOUNCED UP AND DOWN) AT AROUND 4-5 HZ. IT IS RARE, BUT I HAVE SEEN CERTAIN STRETCHES OF ROAD CAUSE THE TRAILER TO BOUNCE UP AND DOWN AT THAT FREQUENCY. THAT FREQUENCY RANGE CAN CAUSE THE LIQUD TO RESONANT, CAUSING THE SIDEWALLS OF THE IBC TO BOW IN AND OUT. THAT MOVEMENT CAN CAUSE THE METAL FRAMES TO BREAK AND IBC TO RUPTURE""    I RECOMMEND THAT DOT CONSIDER INCREASING THE VIBRATION AND LEAKPROOF STANDARDS FOR MANUFACTURERS OF IBC COMPOSITE PACKAGING. DURING OUR INVESTIGATION WE FOUND THAT THE TRAILER WITH THIS IBC TRAVELED ON ONE VERY ROUGH PORTION OF AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY (FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE TO TWO MILES), JUST SOUTH OF THE WISCONSIN-ILLINOIS BORDER. VIBRATION AND LEAKPROOF TEST NEED TO HAVE EQUAL OR GREATER LEVELS THAN WHAT IS FOUND ON SOME OF THE ROUGHEST ROADS IN THE US.S.

The tank car is located in track 500, MP 788.1, Baton Rouge, LA on the New Orleans Subdivision.      US Environmental Services (USES) was contacted by KCS to respond to leaking tank car. Upon investigation, USES found the leak source was from the bottom outlet valve (BOV) steam packing. Responders tightened the packing nut and corrected the release. The responder found the packing nut very loose (not even figure tight). Appeared previous loader/unloaders loosened this packing nut to ease the operation of the BOV and failed to retighten the packing nut. The repair was monitored for 30 minutes to assure a tight closure.   At approximately 11:51 USES notified KCS that the leak was stopped and tank car was secured.    File Note Item 19the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27--Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions. The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

Veolia arrived at location at approximately 8:45 am to remove seven (7) 275-gallon totes of oil contaminated with Polychlorinated Biphenyls.  The PCB level in the oil was 90 ppm according to the analytical testing previously supplied to Veolia.    A forklift driver from LSS loaded the first tote of seven onto the back of Veolia's truck.  A Veolia employee was using a pallat jack to move tote to the front of the truck.  While the employee was moving the tote, the bottom valve on the tote started to leak.  The tote released approximately 250 gallons of the liquid.  The calculated PCB concentration that was released is 0.19 lbs.    The Veolia employee immediately placed spill pads and booms around the nearby stormwater drain to prevent a release.  The forklift driver from Latrobe Speciality Steel brought bags of oil dry to clean-up and free liquids.  A third party spill clean-up contractor was called in to address the spill and clean-up.    The valve assembly attached to the body appeared to crack and break away from the body while it was being moved into position.  No portion of the valve or valve body came into contact with anything that would have contributed to the failure.","Although the container failure was not a result of any Veolia actions, Veolia conducted a training class with their employees that service the Latrobe, PA area.

Upon arrival to his domiciled terminal he backed into his assigned door and when he went to remove his equipment from the inside of the trailer he noticed that a drum had been damaged in transit. Our drivers carry pallet jacks in their trailers to help them load and unload freight. The pallets jacks are secured to the inside of our trailers by chains that are attached to them that clip into the e-track system built into the inner walls of our trailers. During transit the etrack clip became unhooked and as a result the pallet jack became loose and struck the drum resulting in a small hole and contributing to the unintentional release.

DANIEL BAILLARGEON,DIRECTOR OF TRANSPORTATION,,,,,Carrier,Truck was headed North bound on US Hwy 101 when it left the road and entered the center divider. The driver attempted to bring the truck back onto the highway causing the vehicle to roll over. The vehicle rolled over onto its left side and then onto its roof ending up on its right side and compromising the tank. The product inside the vehicle became exposed to sparks which ignited the product. The gasoline inside the tank trailer ignighted and engulfed the vehicle in flames. The entire load burned as well as the vehicle and the driver inside the cab. The fire department was not able to get close enough to the vehicle to extinguish the fire and let it burn out. The fire started a small brush fire that was extinguished immediatly and caused damage to US Hwy 101. This was a single vehicle accident and the driver was the only person injured in the crash.,The driver was completely at fault in this incident. The only changes we are looking to make is to possibly at cameras to the trucks to monitor driver behaivior behind the wheel but this type of equipment is very costly. We have held safety meetings and emphasized the importance of driver awareness and rest.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,175561,,,

APPROXIMATE 20 GALLONS OF ACID WAS LOST FROM CRACKED OR DAMAGED BATTERIES DUE TO THE SHIFT. ONLY 120 BATTERIES (APPROXIMATELY 400 LBS) WERE DAMAGED PRODUCT.     THE MILWAUKEE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE FOR CONTAINMET OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS LEAK. THERE WAS NO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT TO ANY STORM DRAINS, WATER WAYS, OR SOIL. IT WAS DETERMINED TO OFF LOAD ALL THE NON-LEAKING BATTERIES AND RELOAD THEM ONTO ANOTHER TRAILER. THE DAMAGED BATTERIES HAD THE ACID DRAINED INTO AN OVER PACK DRUM. THE DRAINED BATTERIES WERE PLACED ON ACID ABSORBENT PADS. THE ACID THAT LEAKED IN THE TRAILER WAS NEUTRALIZED WITH SODA ASH. BOTH THE DAMAGED TRAILER AND THE EXTRA RE-LOADED TRAILER WERE TRANSPORTED TO A NEAR BY TOWING SERVICE'S PARKING LOT.     IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CLEAN UP EFFORTS BY THE MILWAUKEE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR CONTAINMENT OF THE SPILL. EAST PENN MFG HIRED AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPANY TO CONTINUE EFFORTS IN THE CLEAN UP AND RE-PACKAGING OF THE BATTERIES FOR PROPER SHIPPING AND PROPER DISPOSAL OF THE HAZARDOUS WASTE THAT WAS GENERATED.

KCS Hazmat, contacts Hulcher services to request a crew respond to a possible leaking tank car at the KCS Knoche Yard, in Kansas City, MO. Car number NATX37283 was reported to have Petroleum Crude oil leaking from under the protective dome.  Robert Waln, SDM Hulcher Services, is contacted to respond to the incident. Robert Waln, SDM Hulcher Services Inc. arrives on site and Waln proceed to the car shop, KCS Car shop foreman, to arrange for track protection.     KCS locked and flags on Track 32 + 31.  The Hulcher crew proceeded to start an assessment of the tank car. An assessment of the car is completed.      It was discovered by the Hulcher crew that there was product leaking from between the 4 bolt flange and the ball valve on the liquid line of the car.  The liquid line valve assembly was tightened.  All valves were verified closed and plugs were installed.  The protective dome was closed and secured with seal #587792.  The jacket of the car was wiped with absorbent pads to reduce the amount of residue. The Hulcher crew is off the clock for this incident at this time.    File Note Item 19 the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27--Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions. The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

THE TRUCK WAS DRIVEN TO THE NEXT PICKUP LOCATION (NEXUS - 6220 W. 73RD ST. / BEDFORD PARK, IL) AND ANOTHER DRIVER NOTICED LIQUID LEAKING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TRAILER.  THE LME DRIVER INSPECTED THE CONTENTS OF THE TRAILER AND DISCOVERED THE FOUR DRUMS WERE LYING ON THEIR SIDES IN THE TRAILER.                                                                               ACTIONS TAKEN:  THE LME DRIVER CLOSED THE TRAILER DOOR AND THEN CALLED CHEMTREC AND THE CARRIER (LAKEVILLE MOTOR EXPRESS) TO REPORT THE RELEASE.  THE LME DRIVER ALSO NOTIFIED THE BUSINESS (NEXUS) OF THE RELEASE.  NEXUS PERSONNEL NOTIFIED THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.  LME PERSONNEL CALLED ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, INC., AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPANY FOR THE CARRIER.  ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT  DISPATCHED A LOCAL QUALIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL COMPANY TO PERFORM CLEAN-UP ACTIVITIES.  THE CLEAN-UP CREW MADE ENTRY INTO THE TRAILER AND UPRIGHTED THE DRUMS.  THE LEAKING DRUM WAS PLACED INTO A PLASTIC SALVAGE DRUM.  THE CREW THEN USED CLAY ABSORBENTS TO REMOVE THE RELEASED PRODUCT FROM THE TRAILER FLOOR AND FROM THE DRIVEWAY UNDER THE TRAILER.  THE CONTAMINATED ABSORBENTS WERE COLLECTED AND STAGED FOR  DISPOSAL.  A STORM DRAIN WAS IMPACTED BY THE RELEASED PRODUCT.  A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE METROPOLITAN WATER RECLAMATION DISTRICT WAS CALLED TO THE SITE AND INSTRUCTED THE CREW TO PLACE ONE, 50-LB BAG OF SODIUM BICARBONATE INTO THE STORM DRAIN TO NEUTRALIZE THE ACID.  ALL WASTE FROM THE CLEAN-UP ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN SENT FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.  PACKAGE FAILURE:  THE BUNG PLUG ON TOP OF THE DRUM WAS DISLODGED WHEN THE OTHER TREE DRUMS FELL ON TOP OF THE FOURTH DRUM.                           DURATION OF FAILURE:  THE RELEASE IS ESTIMATED AT 40 GALLONS, BASED ON THE REMAINING LIQUID IN THE LEAKING DRUM.",To be better equipped to ensure proper load securememt and the proper transportation of hazardous materials Superior Cartage will provide additional training in proper loading and securement methods and where possible better load securement equipment to all Superior Cartage dockworkers and drivers.

Stopped to investigate.  Discovered right front tire had blown and wheel/rim had been running on roadway.  Shortly afterwards the tire caught fire. Driver used portable fire extinguisher to put out fire and call 911 for assistance.  Tire re-ignited and spread to multiple tires.  Transport vehicle has only four tires, one per wheel position.  The trailer is a fiberglass composite tank.  The fire burned off the external valve and piping which is also a plastic or PVC type material.  The internal valve was heated to the extent that the viton gasketing material melted and failed, allowing the product contained to leak from the container.  Fire Department extinguished the fire and as the vessel cooled the leak decreased.  Hepaco Environmental was contracted by the carrier to respond.  Leaking materials were diked.  Materials remaining in the transport vehicle were transferred to another transport and taken back to shipper for analysis. Tare weights compared indicate a loss of 940 gallons of bleach.  The site location will be restored as per SC recommendations in conjunction with Hepaco.  There are 25 tons of impacted soils that will be disposed of.",NONE AT THIS TIME.

THE WEATHER AT THE TIME WAS HEAVY RAIN WITH TEMPERATURE HOVERING AROUND FREEZING. A TRACTOR TRAILER TYPE UNIT LOADED WITH 7500 GALLONS OF HEATING OIL WAS TRAVELING NORTH IN A LINE OF TRAFFIC AT APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 40MPH APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION WITH A SIGNAL. THE LIGHT WAS CHANGING FROM GREEN TO RED AND TRAFFIC WAS SLOWING.  THE DRIVER APPLIED THE BRAKES THEN PROCEEDED TO DOWNSHIFT AND STOP FOR THE LIGHT. THE ACTUAL CAUSE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED EITHER BY THE DRIVER OR THE RESPONDING OFFICER, BUT THE TRAILER BRAKES FAILED TO RELEASE. UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE SLOWED TO A STOP, BUT UNDER WET AND ICY CONDITIONS THE TRAILER SLID ONTO THE SHOULDER AND DOWN THE SLOPED EMBANKMENT RESULTING IN A ROLL OVER. ALTHOUGH THE ROAD WAS SLIPPERY AT THE TIME, WE FEEL THE REAL CAUSE WAS THE BRAKES ON THE TRAILER FAILING TO RELEASE. THE TRUCK WAS AT POINT COMPLETELY OFF THE ROAD AND LEAKING PRODUCT FROM THE AIR SPACE BETWEEN COMPARTMENT #3 AND #4. THE AIR SPACE IS DESIGNED TO STOP A LEAKING BULKHEAD FROM CONTAMINATING THE PRODUCT IN THE NEXT COMPARTMENT.  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS AIR SPACE HAS A DRAIN HOLE ON THE BOTTOM ALLOWING PRODUCT TO DRAIN OUT. THE DRIVER TRIED TO PLUG THOSE HOLES, BUT THE FIRE RESPONDERS WOULDN'T ALLOW ANYONE NEAR THE LEAKING PRODUCT. WHEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONDERS ARRIVED THEY WERE ABLE TO DRIVE WOODEN PLUGS INTO THE DRAIN THUS CONTAINING THE REST OF THE PRODUCT.","THE FIREMEN ARE TRAINED AS TO WHEN RESPONDING TO AN ACCIDENT TO KEEP EVERYONE AWAY, ESPECIALLY IF THE LOAD IS HAZARDOUS. THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY LIGHT HAD THE FIRE RESPONDERS ATTEMPTED TO ALLOW THE DRIVER TO PLUG THE DRAIN HOLES. THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONDERS WERE ABLE TO RELATIVELY QUICKLY AND EASILY STOP THE FLOW. I UNDERSTAND THEIR FIRST CONCERN IS SAFETY, BUT IN MANY CASES THE DRIVERS INPUT IS MORE VALUABLE.    TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THIS AIRSPACE IS DESIGNED TO BE OPEN TO THE ATMOSPHERE. WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO PLUG THOSOE DRAIN HOLES DURING TRANSPORTATION?

The material releases approximately 3520 pounds.  The fire department extinguished the fire and the UN1866 impacted water migrated into a drainage ditch.  The fire department contained the release with absorbent boom.  Best personnel arrived onsite and applied granular absorbents to solidify the puddles of impacted water. The debris was stock piled next to the concrete support, covered with poly, and surrounded with absorbent boom.  On April 2, 2012, Best returned to collect the stock pile and excavate the impacted soil.  An area of 30'x40'x4"" was removed and back filled to its original condition.

The tank was in the roadway, the opposite lane was open to traffic so he called 911 to have the roadway closed for safety and to notify the local fire department for assistance in handling the release. When the fire department arrived they contacted a local excavating company who came to the site with a large pay loader the tank was picked up and set in a nearby field.

The delivery was to a 50,000 gallon above ground storage tank using his PTO. The contract driver was on his first delivery of the day when the incident occurred. The driver had 6,000 gallons of diesel in his truck tank for Crown Bay Marina. The driver immediately stop the flow of product when  he heard product splashing and call for help from the marina staff via VHF (radio he also contacted CVX on the same radio. There were no injuries fatalities, fire, damage to equipment or package failure including holes, cracks etc., from this spill event. None of the spilled product reached navigable waters.    Our contract driver was on the last 2,000 compartment when the Incident occurred and stops the pump immediately.  CVX supported the Crown Bay Marina operators and staff with pumping the spill fuel form the secondary containment dike area of the facility to the correct storage tank. Then continued with the discharge to the correct storage tank without incident and returned to CVX terminal for debriefing.    At this site Chevron Caribbean was no operational control of the tank gauging, pipeline alignment or storage tank alignment all under the control of CBM. The information gathered during the investigation of the spill showed the Crown Bay Marina Operator miss-understood the instruction giving to him from CM Facilities Manager. He was instructed to receive in tank  one and discharge from tank two. The operator set everything in reverse he received in tank two (which did not have enough space to take all of the fuel) and discharge from thank one.
