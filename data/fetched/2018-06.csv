The baggage accepted for transfer to HA was a cooler containing dry ice.  The quantity of dry ice was listed as 5.5 lbs/2.5 kg or less. There was no failure of the package.      During the off-loading of the baggage it was discovered that the cooler with the dry ice had been  transported to ITO without the proper Notification to Pilot In Command (NOPIC).  HA procedures  state that Interline DG is prohibited.",Root Cause of the incident was that the Company's policy on the acceptance of  dangerous goods was not properly followed. It is the policy (Cargo Manual) 7.1.1(G) of Hawaiian Airlines that the acceptance of dangerous goods via interline transfer is prohibited. Load-master for the flight received a Letter of Counseling for not being aware of DG interline being loaded on his flight.

As the IMTT Chemical Operator was moving the fall protection ladder into place it accidentally struck the spiller pipe which in turn knocked the bucket, which hangs on the end of the arm, over causing coal tar to spill onto the side of the tanker truck. The IMTT Chemical Operator immediately contacted his supervisor who in turn contacted US Ecology(IMTT's OSRO) to clean up the side of the truck. When this was complete the loading . operation continued without incident.",Upon investigation IMTT determined that the loading arm which was recently installed was not level and when the IMTT Chemical Operator went to move the fall protection stairs it struck the loading arm.

There was no failure of the package. The proper Air Way Bill (AWB 03467656), dangerous goods checklist, shipper's declaration and Notification to Pilot in Command (NOPIC) were completed for the shipment and the documents were placed on the clipboard for HAZMAT shipment notification. The HAZMAT shipment was schedule flight on the next flight to Kahului. At approximately 14:53pm, the HA cargo runner picked up the HAZMAT shipment for delivery to the AC. The shipment was taken to the AC without the proper documentation (NOPIC) and loaded on the AC without the proper documentation indicating that the shipment contained DG. At approximately 16:35 the Cargo Station Chief was doing a spot check of the inter-island clipboards and noticed that the hazmat paperwork previously completed for the compressed gas cylinder was still at the Cargo station at which time the Station Chief tried locate the shipment for which the paperwork belonged to. When the shipment could not be located in the cargo facility it was confirmed by the Cargo Runner that the shipment had been placed on a flight (HA226) which departed at 15:36 for OGG.",Root Cause of the incident was HAZMAT procedures are not clearly defined in the Cargo manual.

New Comments: Two one-gallon paint cans and two one-quart paint cans are in the external cardboard box with plastic shoved around and between the smaller cans. cardboard inserts keep the cans from hitting each other, but they push the cans against the external sides of the box. The package was found to be leaking in the trailer as it arrived at our station, tucked underneath the metal belly flaps and on its side despite visible orientation arrows and training that Hazardous Materials are always loaded on Top of the flaps and against the trailer walls. The package appears to be undamaged, but internally one of the 1 gallon paint cans has a large dent in the bottom edge. This appears to have caused the loose rubber/plastic ring around the top of the can to come off entirely, and the paint can lid came off. All contents of the gallon container were lost, and leaked onto multiple other packages, causing a total of seven damages and shipper returns. The remaining three containers have loose rubber/plastic rings, none of which are properly seated or clipped in place to prevent loss of product, however these three also have no damage to the cans outside of minor dents.",,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

The unload manager immediately placed the leaking hazmat in a red bin and called retrieved a maintenance staff member to clean up the spill inside of the trailer. Then the unload manager placed the tote onto the NC belt and asked his fellow unload manager to bring the damaged hazmat to a QA team member. The second manager failed to move the hazmat. AY approximately 8:20 am a QA admin came across the damaged hazmat in the black bin on the NC belt. The QA admin immediately grabbed a red hazmat tote and appropriate PPE and transferred the hazmat liquid and packaging to the red hazmat tote. During the transfer, a small amount of the liquid spilled on the floor. Maintenance was immediately called to clean the spill.

Pressure built rapidly causing the aluminum""A nut"" connection(customer side) to fracture allowing unrestricted flow of product. Driver reacted immediately shutting down product supply and pump, then treating affected area to prevent spread of product using absorbent materials and spill pads. Majority of product remained on asphalt surface, but unknown amount entered grass/dirt area adjacent to paved surface, flowing under a fence line and toward a wooded area. HEPACO(spill contractor) responded to treat and clean up spilled product and contaminated materials. Original estimate of 150 lost gallons reasonably reduced to near 100 gallons after hoses drained and trailer tank compartment gauged. PA DEP(Evan Elliott) was notified of spill at time of release. Upon review the spill contractor returned and handled additional re-mediation where soil was impacted as directed. As of July 2nd, 2018 clean-up of area is done. Attached is the report from the Spill Response Contractor(HEPACO) along with pictures for the area of the spill.

Fuel spilled out of a fuel pump dispenser out a relief valve located under the pump handle. it is unknown the exact amount of spillage at this time as we are still investigating the cause, the tank dimensions/size and duration of spill. Currently we are estimating the spill at less than 120 gallons. At the time of the spill the area was experiencing a large downpour of approximately 1.25 inches of rain in less than an hour. The material that was spilled was washed into the gutters and flowed into the storm drain which does outfall  into the Forest River approximately 1/3 of a mile South. After the incident there was no material/sheen seen in the outfall area or the river downstream for at 1/4 mile. Station Manager is also the City fire chief and there was no danger or materials to cleanup. The Tanker did not fail. The driver unloaded into a wrong underground tank and the excess materials spilled out of the pump at the C store station. The station is investigation how this could have happened and if anything is wrong with the pumps or tank venting system. We are following up on the investigation on this matter as well. once the investigation is complete will have a better estimate of how much product was actually lost. Only costwill be the loss of the product.

I ARRIVED AT ABOUT 1730 HRS. AND CLIMBED THE TOP OF THE CAR BUT COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS. I CHECKED SURROUNDING CARS AND FOUND THAT THE CAR ON THE EAST END OF THIS CAR, TANK CAR TAEX 30165 WAS THE ONE THAT WAS HAVING AN ODOR COMING FROM THE PROTECTIVE HOUSING AFTER I CHECKED IT WITH MY METER. I COULD NOT TELL IF THE PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICE WAS LEAKING OR NOT BECAUSE I WOULD GET A HIT AROUND IT FROM TIME TO TIME BUT NOT EVERY TIME. I TOOK THE COVER OFF OF THE PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICE AND CHECKED IT MORE THOROUGHLY BUT COULD NOT QUITE TELL. I PUT SNOOP AROUND THE BASE AND COULDN’T FIND ANYTHING OBVIOUS. I PUT SNOOP AROUND THE BASE OF THE GAUGING DEVICE ALSO BUT COULD NOT FIND A LEAK. NEITHER THE LIQUID VALVE OF THE VAPOR VALVE WAS LEAKING. I KEPT GETTING A HIT ON MY METER EVERY TIME I PUT THE WAND BETWEEN THE PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICE AND THE GAUGING DEVICE. I TOOK THE CAP OFF OF THE GAUGING DEVICE AND THE METER WENT OFF INSTANTLY. I TRIED TO OPERATE THE DEVICE AND FOUND THAT THE DEVICE WAS FULL OF LIQUID WHICH ENDED UP BEING GASOLINE. I TOOK THE GAUGING ROD OUT AND WAS ABLE TO HEAR VAPOR HISSING FROM INSIDE THE TUBE INDICATING THAT THE TUBE MIGHT BE CRACKED. I CHECKED THE PRESSURE ON THE CAR AND IT WAS ONLY 1 POUND. I PUT EVERYTHING BACK TOGETHER AND TIGHTENED THE GAUGING DEVICE CAP TOOL TIGHT TO STOP THE LEAK SINCE THE O RING WAS IN GOOD ORDER.

The IMTT Chemical Operator immediately contacted his supervisor who in tum contacted US Ecology(IMTT's OSRO) to clean up the side of the truck. When this was complete the loading operation continued without incident.",Upon investigation IMTT determined that the loading arm which was recently installed was not level and when the IMTT Chemical Operator went to move the fall protection stairs it struck the loading arm.
