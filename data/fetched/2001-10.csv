THE DRIVERS NOTED A WET SPOT AND WISP OF VAPOR EMANATING FROM A 1-1/2 INCH DIAMETER PIPING COMPLEMENT ON TOP OF THE TANK. THE LEAK WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A PINHOLE ON THE BOTTOM OF A SHORT HORIZONTAL RUN OF PIPING. THE LIQUID WASTE MATERIAL IS TYPICALLY LOADED UNDER A NITROGEN BLANKET TO MINIMIZE REACTIVITY. THE TANK IS PRESSURIZED WITH NITROGEN DURING THE LOADING PROCESS TO TWENTY PSI AND REDUCED TO ABOUT 2 PSI FOR TRANSPORTATION.

MR. BRAMBILA, DRIVING AN APRIA HEALTHCARE, 1997 ISUZA FRR TRUCK, CA LICENSE 5R72848, WAS WEST BOUND ON STANDING ROCK ROAD APPROACHING THE UNCONTROLLED INTERSECTION WITH MESQUITE. STANDING ROCK ROAD IS A TWO-LANE ASPHALT ROADWAY. MESQUITE IS A TWO-LANE DIRT ROAD. AS HE APPROACHED THE INTERSECTION HE NOTICED A WHITE AUTOMOBILE APPROACHING FROM HIS RIGHT, SOUTH BOUND, AT WHAT APPEARED TO BE A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. HE DID NOT THINK THAT THE OTHER VEHICLE WOULD BE ABLE TO STOP AND INITIATED A HEAVY BRAKING MANEUVER. THE WHITE AUTOMOBILE ENTERED THE INTERSECTION JUST BEFORE MR. BRAMBILA SLID INTO IT. MR. BRAMBILA'S TRUCK IMPACTED THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE WHITE AUTOMOBILE. THE IMPACT AND MOMENTUM CAUSED BOTH VEHICLES TO SLIDE WEST OUT OF THE INTERSECTION. BOTH VEHICLES CAME TO REST ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF STANDING ROCK ROAD. THE WHITE VEHICLE WAS IN THE DIRT, OPEN ACREAGE, FACING NORTH WITH THE FRONT OF THE AUTOMOBILE RESTING AGAINST THE DRIVER SIDE, TOP OF THE TRUCK BOX. THE TRUCK HAD SPUN AROUND AND CAME TO REST ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE, FACING EAST, PARTIALLY ONTO THE DIRT SHOULDER. AT SOME POINT BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE IMPACT AND THE VEHICLES COMING TO REST, SOME OF THE CONTENTS OF THE TRUCK CAME LOOSE FROM THEIR SECUREMENT DEVICES. A 4L200 CYLINDER CONTAINING APPROXIMATELY 98 LITERS OF ""OXYGEN, REFRIGERATED LIQUID"" WAS PARTIALLY PROTRUDING THROUGH A HOLE IN THE TOP OF THE TRUCK ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. THE CYLINDER HAD BEEN DAMAGED IN AN UNKNOWN MANNER, WHICH RESULTED IN THE PROTECTIVE RING AT THE TOP OF THE CYLINDER AND THE PRESSURE GAUGE, WHICH HAD BEEN ENCLOSED IN THE RING, BEING BROKEN OFF. THE DAMAGE TO THE CYLINDER RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE VESSEL. AS THE TEMPERATURE IN THE CYLINDER ROSE, THE ""OXYGEN, REFRIGERATED LIQUID"" BEGAN CONVERTING TO ""OXYGEN, COMPRESSED"", CAUSING THE PRESSURE IN THE CYLINDER TO INCREASE. THIS RESULTED IN THE GRADUAL RELEASE OF ""OXYGEN, COMPRESSED"" INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. INDIVIDUALS, UNIDENTIFIED, ASSISTED MR. BRAMBILA FROM HIS OVER-TURNED VEHICLE. THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE (APPLE VALLEY CONTRACT OFFICE) AND THE APPLE VALLEY FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO SCENE. THE OTHER VEHICLE WAS IDENTIFIED AS A WHITE 1995 MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE, CA LICENSE 4EFP267. THE DRIVER AND THREE PASSENGERS HAD TO BE EXTRACTED FROM THE VEHICLE. THE DRIVER WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE. TWO OF THE PASSENGERS WERE TRANSPORTED VIA MEDICAL HELICOPTER TO THE ARROWHEAD REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER AND THE THIRD PASSENGER WAS TRANSPORTED VIA AMBULANCE TO ST. MARY MEDICAL CENTER. THE APPLE VALLEY FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED A ONE-MILE RADIUS DUE TO THE OXYGEN RELEASE. THEY PROCEEDED TO OPEN A LARGE HOLE IN THE TOP OF THE TRUCK TO INSPECT THE CONTENTS.
