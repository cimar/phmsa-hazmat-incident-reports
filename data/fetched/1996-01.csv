THE RELEASE OCCURRED WHEN THE PIPE JOINING THE FLANGE AND VALVE FAILED.  THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE APPEARED TO BE DETERIORATION OF THE PIPE AND FITTINGS DUE TO REACTION WITH THE PRODUCT.  DUE TO PRESSURE IN THE CAR AND THE LIQUID (UNLOADING) VALVE IN ITS OPEN POSITION, PRODUCT REMAINED IN THE UNLOADING ASSEMBLY.  WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURRED, PRODUCT WAS SPRAYED OUT OF THE CAR.  A TRAIL OF APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET IN LENGTH LEAD RELEASED PRODUCT TO A LOW AREA WHERE POOLING BEGAN.  THE POOL AREA WAS APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET BY 30 FEET.  VAPOR FROM THE POOL AND FROM THE FAILED UNLOADING ATTACHMENT PRODUCED A VAPOR CLOUD THAT FORMED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.

THAT OCCURRED ON JANUARY 1, 1996 AT APPROXIMATELY 6:30 P.M. AT THE I-264 EXIT RAMP AT BROWNSBORO ROAD. AFTER INVESTIGATION AND A DISCUSSION WITH THE DRIVER OF THE UNIT INVOLVED, IT APPEARS THE DRIVER WAS EN ROUTE TO A CUSTOMER LOCATED IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA. THE DRIVER WAS EAST BOUND ON I-264 WHEN HE FAILED TO EXIT ONTO I-64 EAST, AND THEN PROCEEDED TO THE BROWNSBORO ROAD EXIT WHERE HE COULD MANEUVER A TURNAROUND. IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE DRIVER, WHILE ON THE EXIT RAMP, TO AVOID A COLLISION WITH THREE VEHICLES SITTING AT THE SPOTLIGHT AT THIS LOCATION, MANEAUVERED HIS VEHICLE TO THE LEFT SHOULDER OF THE ROAD AND CONTINUED TO THE INTERSECTION. THE DRIVER IN THE FIRST VEHICLE STARTED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION WHEN THE UNIT STRUCK THE SIDE OF THE FIRST VEHICLE. THE DRIVER TURNED THE UNIT SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT WHICH CAUSED THE UNIT TO TURN OVER ON IT'S LEFT SIDE. AS A RESULT, FIVE OF THE EIGHT DOT SPEC. 56 CONTAINERS LOADED WITH APPROXIMATELY 1200 LBS OF MATERIAL ON THE ROADWAY. THIS MATERIAL WAS CLEANED UP BY THE HARRODS CREEK FIRE DEPARTMENT WITH SUPERVISON BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CARBIDE/GRAPHITE GROUP AND PUT INTO 55 GALLON DRUMS AND RETURNED TO OUR FACILITY FOR REUSE. AFTER THE MATERIAL WAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE, THE SITE WAS THEN SWEPT CLEAN AND HARRODS CREEK FIRE DEPT. WASHED THE ROAD. THE RESULTING SLURRY BECOMES CALCIUM HYDROXIDE WHICH IS NOT A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL.

TRL CONTACT WAS DISPATCHER DALE OTTO. J.T. BAKER CONTACT WAS CHARLIE RUFE.  AT 9:30PM, THE RINCCHEM RESPONSE TEAM MOBILIZED AND DEPARTED THE RINCHEM YARD 10:00 PM VIA THE RINCHEM EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLE.  THE CREW WAS DIRECTED TO EXIT 96 OFF US INTERSTATE 40, THIRTY MILES EAST OF AMARILLO, TEXAS.  ARRIVAL TIME ON SITE AT LUV'S TRUCK STOP WAS 4:30 AM ON JANUARY 14, 1996.  TRL DRIVER RAY CHITSWARA WAS CONTACTED; DURING THE MEETING, LEAD TECHC ALFRED S. WAS INFORMED THAT AN ENTRY INTO THE TRAILER HAD BEEN DONE BY THE TRL DRIVER AND THAT THE LEAK APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM FOUR POLY 55 DRUMS ON A PALLET TWO THIRDS OF THE WAY INTO THE TRAILER.  ENTRY TEAM CONSISTING OF ALFRED S. AND JOHN F. USED LEVEL ""B"" PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE), WHICH INCLUDED KLEENGUARD TYVEK COVERALLS, RUBBER BOOTS, PVC GLOVES, AND SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS (SCBA).  ENTRY WAS DIFFICULT, AS THE PALLETIZED PRODUCT WAS DOUBLE STACKED IN THE REAR OF THE TRAILER; UPON REACHING THE POLY DRUMS, THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED AS COMING FROM ONE DRUM CONTAINING POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE.  IT APPEARED THE TRL DRIVER HAD MADE AN ATTEMPT TO CONTAIN THE LEAK AS THERE WAS ""KITTY LITTER""  ON AND AROUND THE LEAKING DRUM, AND THIS MATERIAL WAS REACTING WITH THE POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE. WHERE PUDDLED, THIS LIQUID WAS ""BOILING"" WHEN COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE KITTY LITTER.  THE ENTRY TEAM APPLIED APPROXIMATELY 200LBS OF CALCINED CLAY ABSORBENT TO ALL THE FREE LIQUID IN THE TRAILER.  THE LEAK WAS CONTAINED TO THIS UNIT.  UNLOADING THE PRODUCT AT THE TRUCK STOP FOR FINAL CLEANUP WAS NOT FEASIBLE.  THE DECISION WAS MADE TO MOVE THE TRL TRUCK TRAILER TO THE RINCHEM YARD IN ALBUQUERQUE, NM WITH THE RINCHEM EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLE ESCORTING.  THE TRUCKS DEPARTED AT 5:30 AM, ARRIVING AT THE RINCHEM FACILITY AT 11:30 AM ON JANUARY 14, 1996.  USING THE WAREHOUSE DOCK ALL OF THE MATERIAL FROM THE TRAILER WAS STAGED ONTO 10 MIL PLASTIC SHEETING AND THE LEAKINE CONTAINER WAS PLACED INTO AN 85 GALLON POLY OVERPACK DRUM.  MORE CLAY ABSORBENT WAS USED ON THE REMAINING FREE LIQUID IN THE TRAILER AND WAS SWEPT UP.  THE CHEMICAL REACTION WHERE THE LEAK OCCURRED HAD LEFT AN 18 INCH BY 36 INCH PORTION OF THE FLOOR EATEN AWAY, DOWN TO THE INSULATION PART OF THE TRAILER FLOOR.  LEAD TECH ALFRED S. RECOMMENDED THE TRAILER NOT BE USED TO TRANSPORT THE MATERIAL OVER THE ROAD UNTIL REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED TO THE FLOOR.  ALL OF THE PRODUCT FROM THE TRAILER WAS PROPERLY SEGREGATED AND STORED IN THE RICHEM WAREHOUSE UNTIL J.T.

OLDIGS REGARDING THE CONDITION OF OUR DRIVER, MR. HEIN, THE CONDITION OF THE VEHICLE, AND ANY SPILL THAT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED.  I WAS INFORMED THAT MR. HEIN WAS IN ""GOOD SHAPE"" BUT HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL BY AMBULANCE AS A PRECAUTION.  NO OTHER VEHICLES HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT.  THE TRACTOR/TRAILER WAS ON IT'S SIDE BUT NO LEAKING COMPARTMENTS HAD BEEN DETECTED.  THE FRONT AND REAR COMPARTMENTS CONTAINED PRODUCT BUT THE MIDDLE COMPARTMENT WAS EMPTY.  I WAS INFORMED THAT, BECAUSE THE TRAILER WAS PARTIALLY LOADED, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DRAINED BEFORE BEING UP-RIGHTED.  OPTIONS WERE DISCUSSED AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE PRODUCT REMOVAL AND UP-RIGHTING OF THE TRAILER WOULD WAIT UNTIL DAYLIGHT.  MR. ODLIGS STATIONED A VEHICLE WITH EMERGENCY LIGHTS AND A FIREMAN AT THE SCENE TO SECURE THE AREA.  I MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A TANKER TO BE ON SITE AT DAYLIGHT FOR THE PRODUCT REMOVAL.  11:00 P.M.  I SPOKE WITH PAUL HEIN AT THE REEDSBURG MEDICAL CENTER IN REEDSBURG, WISCONSIN, AS HE WAS BEING RELEASED.  HE STATED THAT HE WAS OK WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A LITTLE SORENESS IN HIS LEFT SHOULDER BUT WAS UPSET WITH HIMSELF THAT THE INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED.  HE INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ISSUED A TICKET.  I EXPLAINED MY PLANS TO UNLOAD AND UP-RIGHT THE TRACTOR/TRAILER.  WE DISCUSSED PAUL'S PLANS FOR THAT EVENING.  HE DECIDED TO HAVE THE JUNEAU COUNTY POLICE DROP HIM AT A LOCAL HOTEL WHERE HE WOULD GET SOME REST AND CHECK IN WITH ME THE NEXT DAY.  I MET WITH UNIBULK DRIVER, LENARD ROCKNOWSKI WHO HAD A CLEAN SINGLE COMPARTMENT TRAILER AND THE EQUIPMENT NEED TO DRAIN THE DAMAGED TRAILER.

ROCKNOWSKI, OF UNIBULK TANK LINES, MR. OLDIGS, OF THE LYNDON STATION FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND I MET FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES TO DISCUSS THE EVENTS OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING.

AT THE SCENE WE MET WITH DON CAUGHLIN, THE FIRE CHIEF, BRIEFLY DISCUSSED THE VENT LEADING UP TO THAT POINT AND DECIDED TO BEGIN THE DRAINING OPERATION. BOTH ENDS OF COUNTY HIGHWAY HH WERE SECURED BY TWO MEMBERS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND JUNEAU COUNTY POLICEMAN.  HIGHWAY HH IS NOT A HEAVY USED HIGHWAY SO DISRUPUTION TO LOCAL TRAFFIC WAS MINIMAL.

THERE WERE 8 OTHER DRUMS LOADED ON THE LEFT FRONT OF THE TRAILER, AND 3 CARTONS OF RUBBER PRODUCTS LOADED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TRAILER.  OUR DRIVER DEPARTED PDL, IN ORANE, TO DELIVER SOME PRODUCT TO CYRUS BUSINESS FURNITURE IN COMPTON.  HE EXITED THE WESTBOUND 91 AT WILMINGTON AND PROCEEDED SOUTH ON WILMINGTON TO CASHDAN.  HE THEN TURNED LEFT TO ARRIVE AT CYRUS BUSINESS FURNITURE.  UPON ARRIVAL AT CYRUS, WHILE BACKING UP THE TRUCK INTO THEIR DRIVERWAY, HE NOTICED SOME LIQUID LEAKING FROM WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS THE TRACTOR.  HE IMMEDIATELY SHUT OFF THE TRACTOR.  HE GOT OUT TO INVESTIGATE AND FOUND LIQUID COMING FROM THE TRIALER.  HE WENT DIRECTLY TO A PHONE AND INFORMED THE ATCHESON'S EXPRESS' DISPATCHER THAT ONE OF THE PALLETIZED TOTE BINS, LOCAED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRAILER TOWARD THE REAR, WAS LEAKING.

BY THE TIME OUR DRIVER FOT OFF THE PHONE, THE POLICE WERE PULLING UP THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT.  I LEFT MY OFFICE IN ORANGE AND WENT TO CYRUS SO THAT I COULD ASSESS THE SITUATION.  UPON ARRIVAL, I QUESTIONED THE DRIVER WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  HE REPORTED THAT NOTHING UNUSUAL HAPPENED DURING THE ROUTE SUCH AS BRAKING HARD, OR TURNING FAST.  HE DID MENTION THAT ON WILMINGTON, WHILE HE WAS DRIVING IN THE LEFT LANE GOING SOUTH, THERE WERE SOME UNMARKED RAILROAD TRACKS THAT GAVE HIM A SUBSTANTIAL JOLT AS HE RODE OVER THEM, EVEN THOUGH HE WAS GOING WELL UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT.  AT THIS POINT THOUGH, HE STILL DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED TO THE CONTENTS IN THE TRAILER.  AFTER THE FACT, IT WAS NOTED THAT APPROXIMATLEY 80-100 FEET, SOUTH OF THE RAILROAD TRACKS, THE ROAD HAS AN INCLINE.  IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT THE MATERIAL IS FIRST NOTICED ON THE PAVEMENT.
