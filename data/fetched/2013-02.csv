Upon arrival in the Knoche Yard in Kansas City, MO the tank car was isolated and investigated. Appropriate notifications were made and emergency responders were activated.    Upon further investigation by emergency responder 3 leaks were found from within both cabinets (right-side + left-side). The first leak source was found in the R side cabinet where the Bottom Fill Valve (V-2) was found slightly open and liquid Argon was leaking out of a gap in the Hose Bleed valve connection. Shipper may have offered this car into transportation with the cracked and leaking Hose Bleed valve.      The second leak was also in the R side cabinet, where the Pressure Build Valve was found slightly open and leaking from the vaporizer. Both of these leaks were caused from loose valves, with loose zip-tie straps which were installed incorrectly.     The third leak was found in the L side cabinet where the regulator valve was found with the adjustment lock nut loose and the adjustment screw was backed out placing the regulator in the open position. All three leak sources were repaired and the tank car released back into transportation. The shipper will secire the One Time Movementa Approval (OTMA).    * No injuries reported    File Note Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence.     It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

Greg stated that they had discovered a small leak on the trailer he was using. The trailer number is  719 and its in nice condition. Greg was trying to explain to me where it was leaking but he finally put the DOT inspector on and the inspector and I had a good conversation and he was able to explain the situation better. It was reported by the inspector that there was a small barely audible leak coming from the internal valve area. Upon further discussion with the inspector, he was finally able to pin point the leak to the 3 bolt shaft and cam housing that bolts into the side of the internal valve. On some valves, there is an O ring inserted in the housing, on others it’s a thin metal gasket. The inspector had used a “soap” solution to pin point the leak.    The next step then was that I called ARI and had them send out a service truck and I had them snug down on the 3 bolts on the housing slightly and they were able to get the leak to where it was not apparent enough to keep the inspector from releasing the unit. This is not a normal step to take as those bolts never loosen up but we had nothing to lose at this point. Snugging those bolts just that little extra closed the gap on the defective gasket just enough to slow it down to an occasional bubble.    The trailer is to be unloaded at Naples and then taken directly into Krutsingers repair services in Tampa.",,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,AmeriGas Propane LP,US,

The loader was to load 45,000 lbs on the trailer.  He had checked the load gauge at 8,000 lbs, but did not go back up the loading platform and check the volume on the load until the gauge was at zero. He followed normal procedure and blew the loading line empty.  He unhooked the lines per the procedure.  As he started down the platform he noticed that 3 gallons of MDI had released when he blew the line clean. The release occured when the line was blown clean after excess product build up in the loading line. The area was barricaded off and all spilled MDI was contained. No drains, water, or soil were impacted. Material was cleaned up and placed into a 55 gallon container.","DIRECT CAUSES:   Lack of situational awareness – Employee failed to monitor the transfer as instructed in SSP 3025-026 “Transferring MDI with Air Compressor”.  He checked the gauge at 8,000 lbs. and did not check it again until it was already at zero.       ROOT CAUSES:   1. Failure to check and monitor – Employee did not watch the pressure gauge often enough.   He should have stopped the transfer before the gauge was at zero pressure.      CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:   1.

Steve Arthur Foster driver was unloading diesel fuel into a stationary above ground tank.  All hoses were connected and the unloading was taking place.  The coupling connection at the above groung tank disconnected due to vibration from the PTO on the road tractor.  Driver Arthur was in attendance and immediately shut down the unloading procedure.  Total time of release was less than one minute.  Release occurred on a packed down dirt parking lot at a rock quarry.  The release was contained with the help of the quarry utilizing a front end loader and rock dirt to mitigate the spillage.  Examination of the coupling hose indicated wear at the coupling point.  Product did not reach any type of public or natural waterway.,"Driver Arthur is trained in the loading and unloading procedures at Foster Fuels, and has unloaded at this facility in the past.  In this particular delivery, we found the coupling connection indicated wear and no velcro fastening strips were used to keep the ears of the coupling connection secure.  This PTO on the road tractor had excessive vibration and has been service.  Velcro fastening strips have been ordered for all Foster Fuels connection hoses.  Foster Fuels will continue to provide training to all of its HM employees and will use this incident for training purposes and safety meetings.

A catch receptacle was placed under GATX 202260 to contain the side shell commodity drips. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder reduced the internal pressure within GATX 202260. Responder's inspection revealed that the liquid valve was in an open position and the leak source appeared to be from the valve stem. The liquid valve was closed which ended any further commodity release. The responder noted that the liquid valve's operating handle came in contact with the valve housing cover's inner sidewall when the housing cover was closed. This contact forced the valve's operating handle to move to an open position. The responder removed the operating handle and placed it atop the fitting plate within the valve housing area.

LOSH,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH & SAFETY MANAGER,333 Rouser Rd,Moon Township,PA,15108,Other-Terminal Operator for TR,"On February 8, 2013 at approximately 1620, an employee at the Tampa TRANSFLO terminal was performing railcar arrival inspection on railcar # PPRX 28503. At the time the employee observed product leaking (hexane) from dome lid and pressure relief device (PRD). He immediately reported the leak to the TRANSFLO terminal manager. Employee tightened dome lid which secured the leak from that area, however, product continued to flow from the relief device. Spill pans were placed in track pans under railcar to catch the liquid hexane that was being released. Once the Terminal Manager determined that leak could not be stopped by tightning the dome lid bolts, all terminal personnell were evacuated and the fire department was called.  Hillsborough County Fire Rescue responded. Approximately 5 ½ gallons released and were captured in the spill pans. No other environmental impacts resulted. With the Fire Department present, 2000 lbs gallons of hexane was transloaded from the railcar to a truck trailer which reduced pressure on the railcar and eliminated the release of additional product.     AWARENESS ITEMS:   1. Railcar arrived 07 February 2013 on the morning switch.  2. Railcar capacity is 29,918 gallons; Railcar Shipping Paper listed 28,290 gallons.  3. Ambient temperature in Tampa on 2/8/2013 was 85 degrees F.  4. Product expands as ambient temperature increases.  5. Pressure releif device was set at 75 psi.    IMMEDIATE / DIRECT CAUSE:  1. Temperature Extremes - Product expanded in railcar resulting in the release of the pressure relief device and subsequent product release.      BASIC ROOT CAUSE:  1. Railcar was overloaded at load port.  Railcar headspace was only 1,628 gallons. Temperature extremes were not taken into account during railcar loading.","IMMEDIATE / DIRECT CAUSE:  1.

Movement was stopped and a BNSF mechanical inspection deemed GATX 80166 safe to move to a nearby repair track in the railyard. No additional commodity release was observed when GATX 80166 remained motionless. A BNSF hazardous material responder inspected GATX 80166 in the early daylight hours on 2/11/2013. The responder reported all shipper seals intact, all six manway securement bolts tool tight and spillage on the side shell was evaporating. The manway was opened to inspect the gasket condition which revealed two manway gaskets applied. A manway nozzle gasket was installed around the top of the manway nozzle and a manway cover gasket was applied in the manway gasket slot at the underside of the manway lid. The responder concluded that the two gasket interface did not provide a good closure seal. The gasket under the manway lid was removed and the manway was properly resecured. Also, the liquid valve's operating handle was found in an open position which allowed it to fit under the closed valve housing cover. The liquid valve was closed and the operating handle realigned to enable it to fit under the valve housing cover in the closed position.  All other valves and fittings were found secure. BNSF seals were applied to the manway closure and the valve housing cover. No further commodity release was reported during subsequent movements in the railyard.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Movement was stopped and no additional spillage was noted when UTLX 200248 remained motionless. UTLX 200248 was cordoned off awaiting inspection from contract responders. Responders reported 1 of 8 manway securement swing bolts were loose. The manway lid was opened to inspect the manway gasket condition and when opened, the applied manway gasket was out of position and partially fell into the inner manway nozzle area. Also, the manway gasket was crimped and cut in one area. A new manway nozzle gasket was installed and all manway securement swing bolts/nuts were properly tool tightened. Securement was completed by 2030 hrs. CST, 2/16/2013. The spillage on UTLX 200248's shell was sprayed with a solution of Micro-Blaze. No ground impact from spillage was observed.

The suspect BNSF train was stopped on main track and a train crew member inspecting the train found entrained tank car TILX 190930 leaking commodity. The BOV operating handle was in an open position and it was closed ending any further commodity release by 1300 hrs. CST 2/17/2013.  Afterwards BNSF and contract responders reported that the BOV operating handle securement pin was sheared-off which allowed the operating handle to fall to an open position and partially opened the BOV.

Also, the vacuum relief valve (VRV) mounted atop the manway lid was stuck in an open position due to the O-ring under the vent cap being torn and out of position, thus preventing closure.

This caused the product valve to crack open releasing about 5 gallons of product. No drains or soil were impacted from the 5 gallon release. Employee announced a release on the radio and Product was contained by damming and diking by other terminal employees. Spill was completely cleaned up. No soil or drains impacted.      Cause: Fitting came loose allowing product valve handle to strike against valve handle on temperature probe fitting. Inadaquate lighting caused the employee to not see that the second pipe wrench had fallen off.,  Remedial Actions Taken:   Communication to TRANSFLO to increase lighting in the MDI transfer area.

BNSF mechanical /hazardous material responders reduced the internal pressure within PROX 14168 which stopped the slow commodity release. During this process, intact shipper seals NorFalco 123972 and 125241 were removed. Spillage on PROX 14168's shell was neutralized. Observed drippings on the ground under PROX 14168 were also neutralized. PROX 14168 was isolated and cordoned off in the railyard. On 2/25/2013, BNSF contract responders inspecting PROX 14168 reported finding the liquid line's closure cap less than tool tight and the cap gasket missing. A Teflon gasket was installed inside the closure cap and the cap was tool tightened. All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure. Response was concluded by 1730 hrs. MST, 2/25/2013. On 2/26/2013, the same response contractors decontaminated and cleaned all spillage from PROX 14168.  Responders also pressurized PROX 14168 up to 14 psig with no commodity leaks detected. New seals SRS 000112, 000115 and 000118 were applied to the fill hole, liquid line and air/vapor line respectively.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,11505,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The trailer was pretty inaccessable due to the amount of freight in it so the Trooper had our drive take the trailer to one of our warehouses nearby for further inspection. The trailer was unloaded at our facility and while doing so it was discovered that one of the top sealed closure devices was slightly leaking. The IBC was removed from our trailer and placed into a recovery area awaiting repair and final disposition from the shipper. Spilled material was neutralized and cleaned with sorbent material.,Not sure what a shipper or carrier could do to prevent a closure from failing during the course of transportation - just seems like a defective closure but hard to tell since it is sealed.

Driver slowed and soon felt an impact and stopped. Unable to see anything outside of the cab the driver opened driver door to assess what occurred. Vehicle 1 was a truck mounted cargo tank - pull cargo tank trailer combination. The pull trailer jack knifed against the truck and punctured the Trailers cargo tank shell. The hole in the tank shell was 12"" X 12"" located 18"" from the bottom of the shell on compartment number 1 of 3 compartments. 1672 gallons of 1800 gallons loaded in compartment 1 leaked onto the roadway and followed the slope of the roqadway aprox 750 feet and flowed into a stormwater drain and into a dry runnoff area. The remainder of the contents of the cargo tank trailer was pumped off onto another cargo tank truck without incident.Vehicle 2 (passenger car) had made contact with the right side of the pull trailer. Vehicle 2 sustained minor damage to the left driver door and hood area. The driver of vehicle 2 was observed and released at the scene of the accident with minor neck pain.Remediation efforts started at 0900 hrs on 02/25/13. Comtaminated soil was excavated and deposited into rolloff bins and relocated to a certified Landfill. New Mexico Department of Transportation and New Mexico Environmental Department have been involved in the remediation process from the begining.",Western has adopted a policy to stop our trucks during winter storms in an effort to eliminate accidents such as this one.

This high speed coupling knocked the covered hopper off center, elevating its north coupler. A loaded tank car of grease followed and coupled into the loaded gondola also at high rate of speed. These three rail cars continued into the bowl tracks towards motionless BNSF 880247. The covered hopper's elevated coupler struck the lower center of the B-end tank head of BNSF 880247 puncturing it. The cause of the automatic retarder's failure to slow rail cars was attributed to foreign material on the wheels of the humped rail cars. The puncture hole in BNSF 880247's B-end tank head was approximately 2 feet by 3 feet in size and allowed residue commodity to escape from this breach during the movement momentum following the coupling impact. BNSF 880247 was deemed destroyed and it was cleaned and purged of hazardous material on 3/7/2013.

The collapse of the shoulder caused the tanker to enter the road ditch and roll onto its side where a stone punctured the transport hull. The driver immediately diverted the released liquid away from a nearby stream ditch with onboard response equipment. A secondary transport was mobilized to the site and collected approximately 21 bbls. of product.

Just before sitting one of the full containers on the ground, Dexter noticed what he thought was chlorine vapor coming from the end of the container. He sat it on the ground, then confirmed that it was indeed chlorine. At that point he shut the engine down and reported the leak to Bermco personnel. The leak was said to be on the rim of the container chime.  Bermco personnel then called the Birmingham Fire Dept. The fire dept. responded, evacuated Bermco personnel and set up an Incident Command and Control Zone.  The fire dept. accepted our offer to assist them in the efforts to contain the leak. Ken Trotter and I (Charles Haddock) departed the Bessemer branch and arrived on the scene at approximately 10:30 a.m.  Upon arrival, we met up with the Incident Commander, EMA and Bermco personnel. They were in the process of determining their approach. They sent in a team of three, donned in level A protection and carrying a ""B"" Kit. They returned saying that the leak was coming from a small crack in the chime and emitting a small amount of vapor and there was nothing in the ""B"" Kit they could use.  After much discussion as to the next approach, it was decided the team would return with some clamps that might be applied, lead washers that might be driven into the crack and a hammer that might be used to hammer the area closed enough to stop the leak. When the team returned this time, they said they were successful in stopping the leak. They said they had stopped the leak by hammering the cracked area shut.   With this being reported, the Incident Commander sent two of his team members in with chlorine monitors to do air sampling.  They returned and reported that the area was all clear.  At this point, the Incident Commander said that he would allow two Bermco employees and two Harcros employees into the area so that the container could be placed into the chlorine room to be hooked up to their process in order to empty the chlorine out of the container.  However, when we got to the area to proceed with lifting the container onto their forklift so it could be moved, we quickly realized that it was still leaking. There was indeed a two inch crack in the outer edge of the chime leaking chlorine but only in a small, pin-hole amount.  We tried for some time to stop the leak with a hammer but were unsuccessful.  This was reported to the Incident Commander and to Bermco's Safety Dept.  Travis Howard, Operations Manager for Harcros in Muscle shoals, was now at the site. Discussions were made as what would be the best option.  We concluded that we should proceed with a plan that Travis Howard had already started in motion earlier in the day. This was to have the chlorine plant in Muscle Shoals prepare several empty ton containers with a vacuum on them, load them on another boom truck and have another driver bring them to the site so we could transfer t","Although  the cylinder  that leaked on 02/18/13  was  last tested on 01/13/13, it was determined by the cylinder manufacturer, Columbiana Boiler on 05/09/13, that there was  a lack of complete fusion in the forge weld area at time of construction.
