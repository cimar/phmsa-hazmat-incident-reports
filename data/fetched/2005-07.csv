When the driver opened his trailer door to enter he noticed a smell of mineral spirits.  The driver made the delivery and proceeded to investigate the odor.  He found a leaking tote in the front right corner of the trailer.  The 22"" dome lid on a stainless steel tote loosened and partially came off during transit.  Approximately 2-3 gallons of material leaked onto the trailer floor and quickly evaporated.  The driver contacted his supervisor who came to his aid with a new gasket, lid and retaining ring.  The new parts replaced the old parts and the driver completed the rest of his deliveries without incident.",Reinforcing the current operating procedure will be addressed.  A through check of the defective tote would have discovered the loose fitting part.

Box 78,HONOLULU,HI,96810,Facility,"The release occurred while transferring asphalt cement from a tanker truck into two above-ground storage tanks. The release occurred at approximately 0615 on 07/07/2005. A tanker truck containing asphalt cement was discharging its contents into a 100-gallon holding tank that pumps the asphalt cement into two 32,500-gallon above-ground storage tanks. The pump inside the holding tank failed due to an electrical surge. This caused the holding tank to overflow approximately 300-gallons of asphalt cement. At the time of the release, the driver of the tanker truck was approximately 20 feet from the tanker truck shutoff valve. The driver of the tanker truck immediately became aware of the release and turned off the flow of asphalt cement from the tanker truck. The duration of the release is unknown.     The area of the release was paved with asphalt and no soil was affected.    After the flow of asphalt cement shutoff, it was allowed to cool then scooped up with shovels and stockpiled onsite. The stockpiled asphalt cement will be reused to produce asphalt at a later date.",A set of driver rules was developed and immediately implemented.    1. Drivers must follow designated routes to loading/unloading racks and control rooms.  2. Drivers must remain with their trucks and out of the truck cab during loading/unloading operations.  3. Drivers must close loading/unloading valves prior to leaving the rack.  4. Drivers must wear personal protective equipment during loading and unloading operations.  5. Drivers must wear a face-shield in the down position during loading/unloading operations.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,Grace Pacific Corporation,US,

The leak was discovered at their site before starting the unloading operation. The rail car was still temporary storage. The rail car contained 180 000 lbs of chlorine at the time of reporting.    Pioneer sent Hazmat trained personnel to help Borden & Remington personnel handle the situation. It was uncovered that the leak was coming underneath the flange of the right vapor angle valve as per chlorine manufacturer terminology.    An emergency C-kit was applied to mitigate the leak.    In the following days, Borden & Remington proceeded with the unloading of the chlorine rail car. Once the transfer was completed, Pioneer sent, to the rail car location, a Pioneer representative along with an emergency contractor to degas the chlorine rail car in a diluted solution of sodium hydroxide and purge it with nitrogen. As a precaution, the vapor valve was replaced with a new one. This operation took place on August 3rd and August 4th. No leakage was experienced during the tank car clean up.    During the clean up operation, a visual inspection of the dome plate and the valve was performed. The gas valve was in excellent conditions. However, the gasket grooves located on the pressure plate showed damage in 2 specific areas. The thickness of the grooves was less in these specific areas. It is believe that an impact on the grooves during the valve installation or gasket removal could be at the source of the problem.","In light of the observations, Pioneer is proceeding in providing refresher training on valve installation, valve maintenance and gasket removal procedures to the chlorine operators involved in these operations. Our internal procedures do include a mention on the importance of using proper tools such as a brass screwdriver and not a metal screwdriver in order to prevent impact or gouge on the grooves.",No,TANK CAR,Pressure,105JW,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,PIONEER AMERICAS LLC,US,

The steel material had been completely rubbed away and a whole was created.  A small amount of the Syltherm XLT Heat Transfer fluid had been released on to the trailer floor.  The damaged drum was overpacked into a salvage drum and re-palletized for further shipment.  The liquid on the trailer floor was absorbed with granular sorbents.  This material was then swept up and placed into a drum for proper disposal. The entire process of response and spill clean up took approximately 6 hours.","Our recommentdation would be to have the shipper check all pallets and drums prior to shipment.

He immediately called for a clean up crew.  Upon arrival to the site the ER crew found two 55-gallon poly drums with loose bungs.  The Syltherm XLT material had apparently leaked through the loose seals due to the jarring during transportation.  Approximately 8-9 gallons of material was spilled on to the trailer floor.  The ER crew tightened the bungs on all drums present to ensure that no further leaks would occur.  The liquid on the trailer floor was absorbed using granular sorbents.

A haz mat response team was called in to clean up spill. Upon arrival they were shown a puddle of product in front of two loading dock doors on the concrete drive. The puddle was covering an area 4 to 5 feet wide by 30 feet long. The trailer was empty and the floor appeared to be damp from the product. Some of the product had seeped through the floor but most of it had run out the back of the trailer onto the concrete. Absorbent material was utilized to clean up all of the free liquids. A neutralization solution was sprayed on the concrete, the inside and the outside of the trailer. It was allowed to neutralize for 30 minutes prior to additional absorbent being placed down to remove all free liquids. Upon inspection of the tank it was found that it was an 80 gallon tank with 36 gallons of product actually shipped (excess product). It is estimated that 8 to 10 gallons of product spilled. When it tipped over the product was released from the bung cap. The bung cap had only been hand tight and the O-Ring seal was broken. The outside of the tank was neutralized and cleaned. One 55 gallon drum of waste was generated and taken off site to Environmental Management. The tank and remaining product were also removed by Environmental Management.

Delivery date postponed until 08/01/05. Cargo tank parked on gravel parking lot.  July 23, 2005 - As per standard operating procedure, Heil cargo tank visually examined and found to be ok.  July 25, 2005 - Heil cargo tank visually examined, indications of spillage were found on the ground.  Estimated that approximately 10 gallons were spilled.  Pre-trip analytical results were cansulted and no RQ values were exceeded. It was determined a combination of high ambient temperatures, the nature of the load, and the slight incline upon which the tanker was parked caused failure of a PVC cap on a fitting at the rear hatch of the tanker.  The Schedule 80 PVC fittings, including the plug, vertical pipe section and the flange were also compromised.  They were soft and    pliable, with ripples in the plug threading and a tear where the leak began. The cargo tank was moved and 15 yd3 of soil was removed from the affected area as quickly as possible.  A backhoe was brought in to facilitate soil removal.   Analytical samples of the contaminated soil were taken and sent to an off-site lab to confirm that RQ values were not exceeded.  All contaminated soil will be disposed of in an environmentally correct manner. The hole was then filled with course aggregate (to indicate the depth of excavation should further examination be necessary) followed by top gravel.  July 26 - All PVC fittings on the Heil Cargo tank were replaced with chemical-resistant coated steel or stainless steel fittings.","- All PVC fittings on the Heil Cargo tank were replaced with chemical-resistant coated steel or stainless steel fittings.  - All loaded vehicles in the transportation cycle will be parked on the concrete pad.    - A specific cargo tank parking area, complete with it’s own secondary containment, is being designed and will be built as soon as feasible.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,23709,"Drug & Laboratory Disposal, Inc.",US,

Additionally, once final damage costs are known, a follow-up report will be submitted. Driver directed to p/u intermodal container at pier 64 in Port Elizabeth. Container is a 20 ft. box containing 14x1375 Kg IBC's. Driver was transporting from pier to local freight forwarder about a mile away for transloading.  While rounding a curve at a very slow speed (estimated to be below 5 mph as attested by a witness) the vehicle rolled onto its left side. When this occurred, one of the IBC's ruptured causing discharge of the material. The police from the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey (which controls this area)arrived on scene and took charge. We are not sure if the consignee (via the freight forwarder) or the Port Authority Police directed a clean-up crew to the scene for mitigation of the spill. Representatives from HMHTTC and the Union County Haz-Mat team responded and cleaned the spill, righted the vehicle and re-opened the roadway. NO INDIVIDUALS SUSTAINED INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THE RELEASE, however, the vehicle driver was transported to a local hospital for examination of bruises and sore muscles resulting from the accident. The driver was examined and released and is fine.","In this writer's opinion, this mishap resulted from several miscalculations and over-loading of this container. First, the original pick-up order called for the pick-up of a quantity of 8 x 20' sea containers each containing 14 IBC's @ 1375 Kg net.  The original shipping order provided a gross weight of the containers in pounds while there was no such unit of measurement provided for the individual containers. It was later discovered that these could only have been measured in kilograms which, had  they been so noted, would have clearly shown that these containers were loaded either over their designed gross weight, or double stacked in such a way that a rollover would be all but inevitable at some point. The vehicle driver in this instance is usually extremely cautious and understands the potentialities of a top-heavy load. As a matter of fact, he was going so slowly that vehicles following him were blowing their horns in an attempt to get him to move along. Additionally, there would appear to be some question about how the load was blocked and braced although it cannot be determined fully at this point in time.",No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,45500,"Daybreak Express, Inc.",US,

The trailer was taken by highway to the rail in Seattle and moved by rail to Chicago, IL where our Oswego, IL terminal dispatched a driver to pick it up and move it by highway to Oswego. It was pouring rain the night of the pick up at the rail, nothing was noticed leaking at the time of pick up from the rail. The trailer was taken to our yard where the next day after the rain had quit, the trailer was noticed to be leaking and had an acid smell. The doors were opened and the entire load had shifted. A clean up team was called, they performed the clean up and decon of the trailer. The freight shifted sometime during the load, it is unknow to ABF if the load shifted due to a lack of blocking and bracing in the trailer or if the rail yard dropped the trailer when unloading it off of the rail trailer which would certainly cause the entire load to shift.",The blocking and bracing appeared to be adequate and even well documented before taking the trailer to the rail.

Upon driving approximately 100 yards, unit maneuvered around corner when the kingpin disengaged from the fifth wheel while moving at approximately 5 mph.  Upper coupler slid off fifth wheel, support legs contacted roadway surface (private property), buckled, and bent under.  Support leg bolsters and upper coupler took the brunt of the impact.  Bolsters caused the third ring of the cargo tank to buckle, thus structural damage.  Unloading line of compartment 1 also bent out of position, warranting inspection.    There was no loss of lading from any compartment.  All material was unloaded from the cargo tanks from the domes.  Upon removal of lading, a wrecker was employed to lift the cargo tank, allowing for inspection of the kingpin.  When deemed sound, the cargo tank was attached to a tractor unit.
