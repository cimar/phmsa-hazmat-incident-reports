M&M Protection was notified to respond to the scene to inspect, repair and re-mediate the spill.  Upon arrival M&M found product dripping around the threads of the bottom outlet cap at a rate of one drop every 2-3 seconds.  M&M vented the pressure off of the car in order to remove the cap and inspect the valve.  Venting pressure slowed the leak considerably.  The gasket on the cap was intact but very brittle. There was also several small pieces of debris in the cap. M&M replace the gasket and reapplied the cap. They then opened the valve to try and clear any additional debris from the valve. The gasket held and did not show signs of leakage. However, after removing the cap again there was still product leaking from the valve.  At that time we notified the shipper, Stolthaven Terminal and Chevron Phillips. The shipper has elected to obtain an OTMA-1 to move the car back to stolt for off loading and then to a shop for inspection and repair.  At this time the bottom outlet cap is holding and the leak is contained.",Chevron Phillips and Stolthaven terminal will be inspecting the valve to determine the cause of the leak.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1250,Port Terminal Railroad Association,US,

After the fire was extinguished, everyone on site moved to a safe distance. Due to the heat of the fire, many of the propane tanks exploded.

Kansas FD and Hazmat Team responded to the railyard and transported the employee to the Hospital.  The immediate area was isolated around the suspect car (HSRX 3141) which was near where the employee became ill.  BNSF Hazmat Responder and KCFD performed an entry to assess the area and recorded no abnormal air monitoring results using a 4-gas instrument and a PID.  It was noted that a slight petroleum odor was evident in the area.  KCFD demobilized from the scene after determining that no immediate risk was present in the area.  A BNSF Hazmat responder and the BNSF contractor conducted an additional assessment of the area including all Hazmat cars that were in the area.  The HSRX 3141 was not noticeably leaking at the time, however because the car had no vapor pressure as expected, it was determined to have the car set out for additional testing.  Once set out, the contractor added nitrogen pressure to the car and found a slight  audible leak at manway sealing area near the handle.  Two bolts were tightened and the leak stopped, pressure was increased to 20 psi and it was determined that no additional leaks were present.  All fittings and leak points were assessed.  The car was held for observation.  On 2/21/16, an odor was again observed from the area around the HSRX 3141.  The Hazmat Contractor returned, there was no direct evidence of a release and the car had 12 pounds of pressure on it.  The contractor opened the manway and determined that there was no gasket (lid or nozzle) in place.  A new gasket was installed and the car was resecured and monitored.  No additional odor was reported on 2/22/16.  Release estimates are based upon information provided by on-site responders.","Shipper has been notified to address the pre-trip inspection process at the originating facility with those responsible for securing cars prior to transport.

Summit found that XOMX 110056, a loaded tank car of UN1193 methyl ethyl ketone, was on its side and a small amount of product was leaking from the vacuum relief device. The vacuum relief device was sealed with a putty material and wrapped to avoid any additional leakage until it could be rerailed.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the transfer operation, it was discovered that one container was missing a bung.   The driver then tried to over-pack the container which resulted in it dropping and spilling 0.5 gallons.  Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised  container into a suitable salvage drum. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and  placed into the salvage drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, the driver did not notice the missing bung.  Drivers will continue to inspect each container during staging period as well as before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity and / or missing pieces.

Upon further inspection of issue, the hissing was noted as coming from the liquid valve plug on the ""A"" end of the car. A smell of mercaptan was also noted in the immediate area of the plug.  The liquid valve was tightened further by hand and the leak seemed to have stopped. At this time, the plug on this same liquid valve was noted to have no sealant or Teflon tape applied to it, but was tool tight.    The contractor arrived on scene and performed a further evaluation.  The contractor was able to tighten the valve further.  It was noted that it seemed like the liquid valve was loosening on its own.  It was determined that the packing was loose on the valve and the contractor tightened the packing gland nut, stopping the leak.  The liquid valve plug was removed, cleaned, and wrapped with Teflon tape prior to be reinstalled and tool tightened.  The valve in question, along with the other valves were all leak tested with Snoop and no further issues were noted.    Note: Question #19 is an estimation of vapor release from the container.",Shipper should ensure proper securement of the valves and all other aspects of the rail car prior to shipping to prevent the release of hazardous materials in the future.

The car was inspected by BNSF Hazmat Responder and setout to a repair track.  On 2/26/16, a BNSF Hazmat contractor arrived to perform repairs on the car.  During the inspection, it was found that two of four liquid line flange bolts were loose, a small amount of vapor was being released between the liquid line flange and gasket.  These bolts were tightened by approximately 2 full turns.  The vapor line was also removed to clean, inspect and reapply thread tape to the connection.  All other closures and fittings were inspected.  The car was held pending the shipper obtaining an FRA OTMA for movement to destination for offloading and to home shop for repair.  The OTMA-3 was obtained on March 4th, 2016 and the car was released to continue on.  The estimated release amount has been estimated based up information obtained from responders and inspectors.","Redfield Energy was contacted and provided details regarding the findings and situation with the SHPX 204767.  Specifically, the shipper should ensure proper securement of cars and ensure that their procedures are applicable to identify issues such as this.

As a result of being on the soft dirt and his reaction to jerking the wheel, the trailer rolled over.  Due to the conflicting parties at the scene, including the fire department and the environmental health department, the trailer was on it's side for almost 20 hours before a tow truck was allowed to start the drilling process to pump out the fuel from the trailer. There was no breakage of the trailer itself.  As a result of the heat from the sun, approximately 12 hours into the incident, the dome lid on the top of the trailer started to experience minor leakage as a result of the fuel expanding. The fire department placed a containment container under the dome lid to catch the leaking vapors from the dome lid.  The leaking vapors did not have any contact with the environment.","Drivers were trained on making sure to hold their lane position in the event that they leave their lane and to make sure that they do not over correct or make dangerous and abrupt turns, which may cause a rollover.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,103015,Cox Petroleum Transport,US,
