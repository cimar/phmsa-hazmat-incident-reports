THE LAST 3 TENTH OF A MILE HAS A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT DOWN GRADE.  THE DRIVER REPORTED THAT WHEN HE REACHED THE BEGINNING OF THE DOWN GRADE HE BEGAN TO APPLY PRESSURE TO THE BRAKES.  HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE TO HIS BRAKING ATTEMPT SO HE BEGAN TO ""PUMP"" THE BRAKE PEDAL.  AS HE APPROACHED THE INTERSECTION WITH CASS AVENUE, (WHERE 91ST STREET DEAD ENDS) HE NOTICED A CAR APPROACHING THE INTERSECTION FROM THE SOUTH.

THERE ARE NO OTHER WITNESSES TO THE ACCIDENT OTHER THAN THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT.  THE DRIVER OF OUR VEHICLE WAS SENT FOR A DRUG AND ALCOHOL TEST, AND PASSED BOTH TESTS.  THE VEHICLE THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT LEFT OSCO'S YARD AT 13351 MAIN STREET AND STOPPED 5 TIMES PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT WHICH OCCURRED ABOUT 10 MILES FROM OUR YARD.

I HAD A PICKUP WITH TOOLS PARKED APPROX. 20 FEET AWAY TO THE WEST OF THE TRANSPORT.  WHEN THE VAPOR STARTED COMING OUT OF THE TRUCK IT FORMED A GROUND HUGGING CLOUD THAT ENVELOPED THE SEMI AND THE PICKUP MAKING MY CELL PHONES INACCESSIBLE. I RAN TO THE BUSINESS CLOSEST TO THE SITE.  SERVICE SUPPLY WAS OPEN AND I USED THEIR PHONE TO CALL 911.  I THEN RETURNED TO THE SCENE AND ASSISTED THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT. WHEN THEY ARRIVED MINUTES LATER.  THE FIRE DEPT. SET A PUMPER TRUCK UP SO AS TO PUT WATER ON THE SITE OF THE ESCAPING VAPOR AND ANOTHER WATER LINE FOGGING THE VAPOR CLOUD THAT WAS ESCAPING.  THE FIRE DEPT. ASSISTED IN GETTING THE MALFUNCTIONING VALVE UNDER CONTROL AND CONTINUED FOGGING THE AREA TILL THE TRUCK COULD BE SAFELY REMOVED TO AN ISOLATED SPOT AND DEPRESSURED SO IT COULD BE PROPERLY REPAIRED.  THE 911 CALL WAS RESPONDED TO BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPT.  THEY EVACUATED THE AREA EAST OF THE PLANT APPROX. ONE HALF MILE AND AN AREA OF TOWN WHEN  THE VAPOR CLOUD STARTED DRIFTING TOWARD IT.

THE TANKER REMAINED INTACT EXTERNALLY; HOWEVER, INTERNALLY COMPARTMENT DIVIDING WALLS BREACHED ALLOWING FUEL TO ENTER VOID SPACES. THESE VOID SPACES ARE VENTED AND FUEL WAS LEAKING FROM ONE VENT OPENING. A PVC PLUG WAS USED TO STOP THE LEAK SHORTLY AFTER EMERGENCY CREW ARRIVED AT THE SCENE. FOAM WAS SPREAD OVER THE SOIL AREAS, AND A TRENCH WAS DUG AROUND THE TANKER. ADDITIONAL SOIL WAS BROUGHT IN TO CREATE A BERM INSIDE THE TRENCH AS A PRECAUTION. EMERGENCY PERSONNEL CUT THE FIVE COMPARTMENTS OF THE TANKER AND OFF-LOADED THE GASOLINE INTO ANOTHER TANKER. LESS THAN 200 GALLONS OF GASOLINE WAS RELEASED AT THE SITE. THE CONTAMINATED SOILS WERE EXCAVATED AND 83.81 TONS WERE REMOVED FOR DISPOSAL TO WASTE MANAGEMENT- THREE CORNER'S REGIONAL LANDFILL IN PIEDMONT, ALABAMA.

THE 20 FOOT CONTAINER WAS MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK TO CONTAIN AND ISOLATE PENDING AN INSPECTION. INTERIOR INSPECTION NOTED THE LADING TO BE 55 GALLON POLY DRUMS, DOUBLE STACKED, AND SECURED WITH TY-GARD. THE TY-GARD STRIPS WERE LOOSE ON BOTH TIERS OF DRUMS, WHICH ALLOWED THE ENTIRE LOAD TO SHIFT TO THE REAR. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH THE SHIPPER TO REMOVE AND INSPECT THE DRUMS. WHILE REMOVING THE TOP TIER DRUMS, NOTED A SINGLE STRIP OF TY-GARD HAD BEEN INSTALLED AT MID SHIP TO BAY OUT THE LADING. THIS STRIP WAS ALSO LOOSE. MANUFACTURERS APPLICATION REQUIRES THE USE OF TWO STRIPS OF TY-GARD TO PROPERLY SECURE THE LADING. ALSO NOTED, THE SHIPPER ONLY USED TWO FULL SHEETS OF 3/4 INCH PLYWOOD FOR THE BI-LEVEL SEPARATION. THE REMAINDER OF THE BI-LEVEL SEPARATION WAS TWO FOOT WIDE CUT SECTIONS OF 1/4 INCH PLYWOOD, WHICH WAS OVERLAPPING, CAUSING AN UNEVEN SURFACE FOR THE TOP TIER DRUMS TO REST UPON. THIS IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE LADING MOVING DURING TRANSIT. WHILE REMOVING THE DRUMS FROM THE FLOOR TIER, LOCATED ONE DRUM, THREE ROWS IN FROM THE REAR DOORS, ON THE RIGHT SIDE, WHICH HAD SHIFTED TO THE REAR AND IMPACTED A NAIL ON THE FLOORING.

I ARRIVED AT CYCLE CHEM IN ELIZABETH, NEW JERSEY AT 8:00 A.M. UPON ARRIVAL I CHECKED IN WITH THE LOADING SUPERVISOR (WALTER). WALTER SAID I WOULD NOT BE LOADING THE PRODUCT MYSELF, HE HAD A CREW FOR THAT.  WALTER THEN BEGAN TO ASK PRE-LOADING INSPECTION QUESTIONS. ""IS THE TANKER EMPTY?"" ""YES"" I REPLIED. ""WHAT ARE THESE PLACARDS?"" (1993) ""FROM THE LAST LOAD, OILY RINSE WATER"", I REPLIED. WALTER CLIMBED ONTO THE CARWALK, OPENED AND INSPECTED THE INSIDE OF THE TANKER AND GAVE HIS MEN THE ""O.K."" TO BEGAN LOADING. BEFORE THEY BEGAN I ASKED TO SEE THE MANIFEST AND A DRUM LIST. WALTER ID NOT SHOW M A MANIFEST OR A DRUM LIST. STATING THAT IT WAS UNAVAILABLE. I FOLLOWED HIM INSIDE TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY WERE LOADING ONTO MY TANKER. THEY SAID THE LIQUIDS IN THE DRUMS THEY WERE PUMPING ONTO OUR TANKER WERE MILD CORROSIVES CONSISTING OF MIXTURES OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID, SULFURIC ACID, AND A LIST OF OTHERS, BUT WOULD NOT SHOW ME THE LIST.  AFTER ASKING MULTIPLE TIMES. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED MY SUPERVISOR (DAVE ROSELL) AND ADVISED HIM OF THE SITUATION. HE TOLD ME WE ARE THE TRANSPORTER, THEY (CYCLE CHEM) ARE THE SHIPPER, THE GENERATOR AND OUR CUSTOMER JUST DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT THE PROPER SHIPPING PAPERS. WALTER TOLD ME THAT THE MANIFEST WAS BEING PREPARED WHILE THEY WERE LOADING AND I WOULD HAVE IT IN PLENTY OF TIME BEFORE I WAS TO LEAVE. WHEN I WALKED OUT TO MY TRUCK I OBSERVED TWO MEN FROM CYCLE CHEM WITH ACID SUITS AND FULL-FACE RESPIRATORS ALREADY LOADING OUR TANKER, USING OUR VACUUM TANKERS 2"" HOSE AND DROP-TUBE. 132 DRUMS OF LIQUID ONTO MY TRAILER (T306, T-5). AS THEY WERE VACUUMING THE LIQUIDS, I OBSERVED THEM POURING NUMEROUS SMALL CANS, AND CONTAINERS OF ADDITIONAL LIQUIDS INTO THE DRUMS THEY WERE PUMPING FROM. I OBSERVED WALTER PERIODICALLY PUTTING HIS HAND ON THE TANKER. I ASSUME NOW, AFTER THE FACT, THAT HE WAS CHECKING FOR HEAT. THE LOADING PROCESS LASTED FROM 8:00 A.M. TO 12:00 P.M. BEFORE LEAVING, I AGAIN ASKED. WALTER'S ASSISTANT THIS TIME, TO SEE A DRUM LIST.ONCE AGAIN HE SAID IT WAS UNAVAILABLE. AT 12:00 P.M. AS I WAS PULLING OUT OF THE SIDE EXIT OF CYCLE CHEM. OUR TRACTOR SHUT DOWN FROM 12:00 P.M. TO 3:00 P.M. DUE TO WATER IN THE FUEL TWO CYCLE CHEM MECHANICS WORKED ON THE PROBLEM AND AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 P.M. I LEFT CYCLE CHEM IN ROUTE FOR DUPONT. I ARRIVED AT THE PILOT REST STOP AT EXIT 7 OFF THE NJ TURNPIKE AT 4:30 PM TO EAT AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 P.M.  PRE-TRIPPED MY TRUCK, WITH SEEMING NORMAL I PROCEEDED DOWN 295 SOUTH. IN THE VICINITY OF EXIT 36-A I HEARD A LOUD BANG AND OBSERVED FUMES AND SMOKE IN THE AIR THAT ALSO FILLED THE CAB OF THE TRUCK. I INSTANTLY EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY SEEING, BREATHING AND MY THROAT STARTED BURNING. I PULLED OFF TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, I EXITED THE CAB, MY VISION WAS BLURRY AND I BEGAN TO VOMIT AND STILL HAD DIFFICULTLY BREATHING. AS SOON AS I WAS ABLE I CHECKED THE TANKER AND IT WAS WARM.
