The loader instructed the driver that a seal was placed on the dome lid.  The driver was released from the loading area and he departed from the plant.      Shortly after departing from the plant the driver noticed product spilling from the crash box and down the side of the tank trailer.  He pulled over and the local fire department responded to the scene and cleaned up the release by putting sand over the released product and removed the waste.      Once the driver was able to investigate the dome lid, he found there was ""copper like"" object in between the dome lid and the dome lid gasket causing a failure in the seal.  Additionally, the driver stated that at the point of the foreign object the dome lid was raised approximately 1/8 of an inch.  The driver was able to remove the foreign object achieving a proper seal.  Once the clean up was complete the driver and trailer were released from the scene.","The driver took responsibility for the release, he stated that he felt he could trust the securement of the tank trailer due to the fact he was able to watch the loader close the dome lid and tighten the wing nuts.  Additionally, the driver was made aware he was not permitted on top of the tank, so he followed plant procedure.      The driver was instructed of the responsibility to ensure the trailer is secure, even if the plant procedures prohibit him from being on top of the trailer.  He was instructed to find the nearest safe place off property to ensure the securement of the trailer.  In addition, the company's progressive disciplinary action was administered, the driver was issued a on-line training video and test addressing load securement.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Eastman Chemical, was notified via CHEMTREC Report 2015-05-20-00165.  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that vapor was being released from a faulty vacuum relief valve.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative (Julie Brown 423-229-6420).  RESCAR, an AAR qualified mobile repair unit, removed and replaced the faulty vacuum relief valve; subsequently RESCAR performed bubble leak test on the car.

THE RAIL YARD NOTIFIED THE FAIRFIELD FIRE DEPARTMENT. TRUCKS WERE DISPATCHED. THE RAILCAR IN QUESTION WAS ON OUR RAIL SPUR WITH 3 OTHER HCI FULL RAIL CARS AND 2 H2SO4 RAIL CARS (1 FULL AND 1 EMPTY). THE LEAKING CAR WAS THE 5TH ONE BACK FROM OUR GATE WHICH ALSO SERVED AS OUR OBSERVATION POINT. THE GREATER CINCINNATI HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE TEAM WAS ACTIVATED BY THE FAIRFIELD INCIDENT COMMANDER. AT 7:34 AM TOM RILEY WAS NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT, AT 7:37 AM CRAIG OWEN WAS NOTIFIED. AFTER OBSERVING THE CAR FROM A DISTANCE A WHITE VAPOR WAS NOTICED EFFERVESCING FROM THE TOP OF THE RAIL CAR.  AT 8:24 AM T. RILEY WAS GIVEN AN UPDATE. AT 9:28 AM JOE CATAMO FROM CSX RESPONSE TEAM WAS ADVISED OF THE SITUATION AND HE OFFERED THEIR ASSISTANCE IF IT WAS NECESSARY.    ONCE THE HAZ-MAT RESPONSE TEAM WAS ON SITE AND THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE MINOR, 2 USALCO EMPLOYEES DONNED PROPER PPE WITH 4 OTHERS FROM THE GREATER CINCINNATI HAZ-MAT RESPONSE TEAM WERE SENT TO WALK TO THE CAR, CLIMB THE LADDER AND IDENTIFY WHERE THE LEAK WAS LOCATED.  UPON 1ST INSPECTION THEY COULD NOT TELL WHERE THE LEAK ORIGINATED DUE TO THE RESIDUE LEFT FROM THE HCI VAPOR REACTION WITH MOISTURE IN THE AIR. AFTER THE VAPOR WAS REDUCED NATURALLY, A SECOND ATTEMPT WAS MADE AND THEY OBSERVED THAT AN AREA AT THE GASKET SEAL ON THE LOADING MANWAY AS LEAKING. THE DOME AREA OF THE RAIL CAR HAD SOME PHYSICAL DAMAGE, NOT FROM THIS LEAK, IT WAS NOT APPARENT WHEN, HOW OR WHERE THIS DAMAGE OCCURRED. IT MAY HAVE BEEN RELATED TO CAUSING THIS LEAK AS IT WAS FELT THE COVER SUFFERED DAMAGE AND MAYBE GOT MISALIGNED, OR GASKET GOT MOVED CAUSING IT TO BE COMPROMISED. FURTHERMORE, THE OPERATOR WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THE HANDLE ON THE DOME LID QUITE EASILY WHEN INVESTIGATING THE RAIL CAR. THIS LEAD TO THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE DAMAGE WAS RECENT AND WAS A POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTOR TO THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK. AT ABOUT 10:10 AM ALL GATHERED TO DISCUSS THE FINDINGS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO AMELIORATE THE LEAK.  IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE BEST OPTION WAS TO MOVE THE RAIL CAR TO THE OFF-LOADING RACK AND TRANSFER THE MATERIAL TO STORAGE. WHILE THE CARS WERE BEGIN MOVED INTO THE USALCO FAIRFIELD FACILITY, FROM THE RAIL SPUR OUTSIDE OUR GATE, USING USALCO EQUIPMENT AND USALCO EMPLOYEES, I NOTIFIED THE OHIO EPA AT 10:23 AM AND THE LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANNING COMMISSION OF BUTLER COUNTY AT 10:28 AM.    ONCE THE RAIL CAR WAS MOVED INTO POSITION WITH USALCO EQUIPMENT AND BY USALCO EMPLOYEES, WE HOOKED UP THE VENT LINE TO OUR SCRUBBER. AT THIS TIME LITTLE TO NO LEAK WAS OBSERVED AT THE LOADING MECHANISM AND GASKET AREA. WHEN THE OPERATOR OPENED THE VENT LINE IT WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN LIQUID. HE CLOSED THE VENT VALVE AND WE DISCUSSED AMONG OURSELVES WHAT WAS OBSERVED.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Reagent Chemical, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report 2015-27-07-00022).  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the fill hole cover securement bolts were less than tool tight and the vapor valve flange bolts less than tool tight.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative (Kevin Callais 409-460-1273).  The noted bolts/nuts were secured tool tight.  Reagent Chemical arranged for an AAR qualified mobile repair unit to perform a successful bubble leak test prior to the car being put back in transportation to ensure that field repairs were adequate and the car was free of leaks.

VICE PRESIDENT TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE,42 Longwater Dr.,Norwell,MA,02061,Carrier,"A van trailer containing a hazardous material was being returned to the original shipper.  During the course of transportation, the vehicle stopped at Clean Harbor’s Laurel Maryland Service Center pending continued transportation.  While parked in a secured location, one Intermediate Bulk Package experienced a release from a bottom valve that resulted in a release of vapors from the package that exited the vehicle and crossed the property line of our facility.      Facility personnel activated their internal emergency response plan and notified local authorities as well as internal spill response teams.  Upon arrival of local Fire Department, a “shelter in place” order was issued to those businesses and homes located downwind of the vapor plume which lasted approximately 1.5 hours.  During this time representatives from the Fire Department and Clean Harbors developed a response plant to not only recover the material that had escaped from the package but also a plan to re containerize the remaining packages into non bulk stainless steel containers.  Due to the hazards presented by the material in question, these activities were performed with the support and guidance of local authorities over a 48 hour period.  All spill debris and re containerized product was then prepared and shipped to a fully permitted waste management facility for treatment and disposal.  IN addition, activities were conducted at the site to remediate and decontaminate all affected areas. This was reported to the NRC and the  Maryland DEP # 0800 053015","It is believed that the original shipper inadvertently shipped fuming sulfuric acid rather than the less concentrated sulfuric acid scheduled for acceptance. In order to prevent a recurrence, Clean Harbors will require that the customer confirm, in writing, that the material being offered for transportation has been inspected and it meets the specification of the material agreed to be accepted.  This confirmation will also certify that the material is prepared for transportation in accordance with all applicable Department of Transportation  requirements. Honeywell has also implemented the following:   1. Honeywell is completing a thorough investigation to the root causes of this incident involving the improper loading of a commercial product into tote containers, subsequent shipment and ultimate off-site incident.  2. Enhanced administrative controls have been and will continue to be implemented for any future product transfers:  Verification of equipment contents, proper sampling and analysis supervised by owning area leadership, substantiation of contractor activities, verbal and written communication to ensure that transfers are legitimate and safe.  3. Enhanced training for all on-site and off-site parties involved in the movement of products, residues, and any wastes.  4. Continued and enhanced DOT training to verify correct packaging of identified hazardous materials.  5. Enhanced communication with Honeywell HSE functional groups when any/all chemical transfers are imminent.  6. Continued development of emergency response personnel and contractors to hazards and technical responses (equipment, strategies, training) for major chemicals at the Hopewell site.

The seal was removed from each tote, the Gem Cap was then removed, the material that was found leaking around the gem cap was cleaned (removed). The Gem Caps were then placed on the tote and a new seal was installed on each tote. The totes where then driven around the warehouse with a forklift to determine if any material was leaking from the totes and no leaking material was found to be leaking from around the Gem Cap. As a result of the incident it was also found that the sealing of the tank opening are uneven and inconsistent and have also contributed to the totes leaking when the Gem Cap is torqued on the tote.","It was determined that updated closing instructions from the manufacture of the tote had not been communicated to the production location and the production location was only applying 75 ft/lb of torque to the Gem Cap, when in fact per the updated closing instructions 120 ft/lbs of torque was required to properly seal the Gem Cap on the tote. The production site is work with the tote manufacture to correct the uneven and inconsistent sealing surfaces on the tote so that a proper seal may be achieved.",No,IBC,"Plastic, freestanding, for liquids",31H2,Yes,,,,,,,182,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Syngenta Crop protection,US,

Wilson St.,Tuscola,IL,61953,Other-safety supervisor for Il,"Environmental Release – 5/27/15  Coles County    At approximately 7:30 am, Kemp office manager Cathie Adcock phoned Pat Titus to indicate their office had been called by Charleston Fire Chief, Pat Goodwin. He indicated the Mattoon and Lincoln Fire Protection District were called out to a farmstead south of Mattoon where four 1,000 gallon nurse tanks were parked, two tanks attached to one another. There was a fifth tank that was attached to the sidedress toolbar, which was attached to the tractor.    Titus quickly returned the call to Chief Goodwin (ph. 217-345-2134). Goodwin said they received a call about 2:30 am and the tanks were blowing 6-8’ streams. Goodwin stated he knew that NH3 valves will loosen up with the change of temperatures. He asked if we planned to consider this a criminal activity, of which I replied “yes.” He also asked Titus to find out when the farmer left the field the night before    At 7:41 am, Titus made a call in to the National Response Center and spoke with Petty Officer Morley. Report # 1117672 was issued. PO Morley asked about the address of Gary Kuhns (farmer) and a phone number for him. He also asked about the amount of product lost.    At 7:54 am, Titus called the Illinois Emergency Management Association and spoke to Josh Deheve. He issued report # H-2015-0572.    He asked about:   Wind speed/direction   Tank size   Amount released   Kuhns’ address and phone number    At 8:02 am, Titus called the Coles County LEPC (ph # 348-0581) but there was no answer and no voicemail. Titus tried again at 9:13 am with no results. Titus mentioned this later in the day to Chief Goodwin, and he said yes…they were aware of the release as the state had contacted them (due to me calling it in to the IEMA).    Titus called Mike Turner about the release. She then emailed a summary of what she knew of the release to interested parties (Turner, Romito, Busby, Dollins from Illini FS, and Cring, Frye, and Zmolek from GROWMARK).   Titus went over to Kemp to get copies of the scale tickets from office manager Adcock. She received a call from Illini FS employee, Terry Warner, who was at the farmsite. Warner asked about removing the tanks. Titus said she wanted to leave them there until scene was investigated. Turner told Adcock he would be down to the farmstead but it would be another 45 minutes.    After leaving Kemp, Titus received a phone call from IDOA NH3 inspector, Dennis Beckmeier. Beckmeier said it would be around 2 pm before he could get there.    Titus went to the location off of Old State Rd. in Mattoon. Two tanks hooked together were on the driveway south of the house, and another two tanks hooked together, with hitch pointed to the east, in the grass to the slight northeast of the other tanks. It was visibly obvious from the dead grass of the release. One could see the direction of the plume the night before, based on the burned leaves of the corn plants.

Driver talked to another driver prior to going to customer site and was told that the tanks were 2 x 5000 gallon tanks. The delivery called for 4000 gallons of Diesel #2, driver stuck the tank which had 4 inches in it. According to the 5000 gallon tank chart the load should have fit. The problem ended up being, that the tanks were only 4000 gallon tanks.      The delivery invoice indicated in the notes area that there were two 3500 gallon tanks plumbed together at this site. Driver failed to pay attention to this note or call into dispatch to verify delivery. There was an overflow of approximately 20 gallons onto soil around the tank via the tank vent. Neither SC Fuels CTMV nor the customers tank were damaged.  There was no immediate threat to public and the Regional HSE Manager was immediately notified, he went to site and coordinated cleanup of the site. Stanislaus Co Hazardous Materials Division- Robert Reiss (209 534-6335) was contacted to report spill and CA Office of Emergency Services was notified and an incident number assigned Cal- OES 15-2918.     Spill was on dirt,  11 barrels of contaminated soil were removed. A soil sample was taken under the direction of Stanislaus Co Hazardous Materials specialist Amber Minami (209 409-4264). Clean up was deemed successful. Safety Kleen Systems Inc (Manifest Tracking #004764566) picked up the contaminated soil for proper disposal.",SC Fuels has a customer base with above ground tanks. It was determined that many of these tanks do not have tank capacity indicators on them. SC Fuels delivery invoices are to include tank size information.     An initiative to label tank capacity and maximum fill is under way. This would include tank charts for each tank that are left at the tank for delivery drivers reference.

Through some miscommunication, the second driver believed the tank level was at a safe level for him to unload.  He began to unload his trailer.  As driver #1 finished unloading and was putting up his hose, he heard a noise, and saw that oil was coming out of the top of the tanks.  He ran over to tell driver #2, whose view was obscured by his trailer, to shut down his pump, which he did immediately.

The minimum start-to-open pressure must be designed for negative 0.75 psig (5.17 kPag).} Therefore it is recognized that this valve is releasing product due to an overload situation, and the vacuum relief valve is non-compliant with 49 CFR 174.50.  Mr. Clarence Vassau was notified of the non-compliant issue and the overloaded status of this tank car.    This will require an AAR 7.1 form to be filed.

The minimum start-to-open pressure must be designed for negative 0.75 psig (5.17 kPag).} Therefore it is recognized that this valve is releasing product due to an overload situation, and the vacuum relief valve is non-compliant with 49 CFR 174.50.  Mr. Clarence Vassau was notified of the non-compliant issue and the overloaded status of this tank car.    This will require an AAR 7.1 form to be filed.  The incident did require a special move to set the tank car out of the K03805 unit train consist.
