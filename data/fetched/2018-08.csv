Employee was already wearing proper PPE, so drum was stood back up, and the waste was cleaned up. The lid was reset on the drum, the closure properly torqued, and then continued on to it's final destination. Due to the minimal amount spilled, no state notification was needed.",Employee was terminated due to multiple infractions of health and safety. Other branch employees were retrained on the proper closing techniques for the drums we use to transport this type of waste.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"CLEAN HARBORS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.",US,

The waybill lists that the unit was carrying hazardous material. In the interest of safety, the unit was placed on hold and moved to the containment pit pending interior for inspection.  Approved contractor Patriot Environmental was dispatched to remediate the leak at the facility. Interior inspection revealed mixed freight to include shrink wrapped cased goods, 5   gallon shrink wrapped plastic pails, IBC totes and 55   gallon drums. The leaking material was deemed hazardous by Patriot Environmental. The origin of the leak was near the nose of the container; a pallet carrying Zep Mud Slide Concentrate (corrosive liquid, acidic, organic, N.O.S UN3265 ) in 5   gallon plastic pails was found smashed at the bottom of the pallet. Cargo shifted to the side of the pallet causing 3 pails to crack at the bottom.

While traveling down the road just east of Bainbridge, OH at approximately 1400 the driver traveled off the right side of the highway onto the shoulder which resulted in the unit overturning across the road and bursting into flames. No other parties were involved in the accident. The driver was able to crawl out of the back-tractor cab window. He sustained a burn on his hand from the muffler. Lykins Transportation, Inc. (LTI) was notified of the situation at approximately 1500 by the Ohio EPA. At this point the Paxton Township Fire Department, Ross Co. Emergency Management Agency, Ohio EPA, and Ohio State Patrol were on scene conducting their emergency response. The driver was unable to notify LTI at the time of the incident per LTI incident reporting procedures because all communication devices were in the cab of the truck. Next, LTI made required regulatory reporting, (NRC # 1221311 & OH EPA # 1808EPA1487), and mobilized their environmental response/remediation contractors, Environmental Management Specialists, Inc. (EMS) to assess and conduct spill clean-up efforts. LTI management staff then headed to the scene of the incident, in order, to communicate with local, state, & federal agencies. And, to aid in the clean-up efforts. Around 1800, the HazMat release/fire had stopped. Most of the hazardous material burned in the fire with around 500 gallons impacting the ground adjacent to the roadway. Ohio DOT replaced/repaired the road within the first 48 hours after the incident occurred. And, over the next two weeks all clean-up efforts were completed by EMS per the Ohio EPA’s discretion/standards.","Lykins Transportation, Inc. (LTI) reviews all incidents, in order, to determine the root cause, preventability, and what actions, i.e. training or procedures, need to be conducted or implemented so that the incident will not happen again. The rollover was cause by the driver going off the road. During the next round of safety meetings this fall, LTI will brief all drivers about the incident and review the dangers of and what to do in the event their vehicle runs off or is forced off the road.",Yes,,Cargo tanks,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,170941,LYKINS TRANSPORTATION INC,US,

Chris placed the package ina tote and put it by the QA desk for me to inspect. Out of an overabundance of caution I put on gloves and proceeded with inspecting the package. The lid had become dislodged during the fall allowing the contents to leak out. Im unsure how long it was leaking by the time the driver discovered it. I found it contained a product known as Reward Landscape and Aquatic Herbicide and decided to look up the SDS. I found that it had a DOT HazMat classification under the transport section. I contacted the HazMat hotline and they said that meant I had to process it as an undeclared HazMat.

On 08/02/18, a shipment containing hazmat identified as UN3166 was received by Hawaiian Airlines (HA) cargo agent in Osaka, Japan.  for transport through HNL to LAS. The article was packaged under the airway bill (AWB) 173-3599-7780 2. The shipment traveled on 08/02/18 HA449  from KIX-HNL. The required paperwork including the shipper’s declaration and Notice to Pilot In Command (NOPIC) accompanied the shipment from KIX-HNL. 3. The shipment was held overnight in HNL awaiting clearance from customs to be transported on the second flight segment from HNL-LAS. While awaiting clearance from customs in HNL, the Chief Cargo Agent on Duty separated the AWB and NOPIC from the 1st flight segment from the build up card. 4. Once the shipment cleared customs on 08/03/18, it was prepared for transport from HNL-LAS on HA 18. 5. On 8/4/18, the Chief Cargo Agent on Duty in HNL became aware that the required NOPIC for the  shipment sent on 8/3/18 did not accompany the shipment. The shipment containing dangerous goods traveled without the required NOPIC. 6. There was no failure of the package.  The root cause of the incident was that the Company's policy on the acceptance and handling of  dangerous goods were not properly followed.   According to 49 CFR 175.33 - Shipping paper and notification of pilot-in-command: The NOPIC document must be presented to the PIC for signature and carried onboard the  aircraft for the duration of the flight.  The HA Cargo Manual Section 7.7.4 states that a NOPIC must be completed and presented to the load master. The load master will then present the NOPIC to the PIC once the hazmat has been loaded. The HA Cargo Manual Section 7.7.4.A.1 states that if the shipment is scheduled to make an online transfer, two (2)  separate NOPIC forms are to be prepared.  The action of separating the NOPIC from the article caused the shipment to be carried on the aircraft without the proper notification to the PIC",HA Cargo Chief was counseled and advised of having the required shipping documents remain with the shipment at all times.  HA Cargo operations are reviewing documentation procedures and developing revised Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure that future omission of required shipping documents does not occur.,No,DRUM METAL,"Metal pail, open head, capacity 10 gallons or less",PAIL MTL,No,Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),,,,ZZ,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC.",US,

(LTI) driver had arrived at the destination, Estes Express in Columbus, Ohio. The delivery was for a full load, 7500 gallons, of on-road diesel fuel. The facility has two underground storage tanks (UST), labeled north tank and south tank, and they are filled from a remote fill-port about 20 feet away from the UST fill-pipe caps. The fill-pipe caps are normally locked out and the only way to gauge the tanks is by getting a Veeder-root reading from the facility. Both tanks showed they could hold more than 5000 gallons of product before becoming 90% full. Therefore, there was more than enough room for the delivery. The LTI driver hooked up to the remote fill-port and started unloading the product at approximately 1150. After a few of minutes went by the LTI driver noticed something was not right and saw product flowing out the top of the UST south tank cap. The product was rushing out the top of the UST and was running down into the facility’s detention basin adjacent to the USTs. The LTI driver acted by stopping the flow of product and quickly grabbed a bunch of spills pads to mitigate the spill. At approximately 1200 LTI Dispatch was informed of the incident. LTI Dispatch than informed LTI Environmental Director who happened to be in Columbus area and responded to the scene directly to assess the situation. At 1235 the LTI Environmental Director was on-scene with the LTI driver and Estes Express personnel. At 1255 LTI spill response contractors, Environmental Management Specialists, Inc (EMS) were notified of the spill. Next, LTI than made all required regulatory reporting notifications: NRC # 1221638, Ohio EPA # 1808EPA1511, and Franklin County EMA. EMS was on-site at 1325 to assess and began clean-up efforts. EMS worked through the evening until the next morning until the spill clean-up efforts and environmental remediation was completed. LTI determined that both themselves and Estes Express were responsible for the spill. The spill was caused by something malfunctioning within the UST’s and remote fill-port system and overfill prevention devices. The UST fill-pipe cap was not locked out, and something within the remote fill did not work correctly, and the south tank’s flapper value did not work which could have prevented the overfill. Also, the spill was a result of the time it took for the driver to shut-off the flow of product which aided in the spill. The spill was contained within the facility’s detention basin and did not leave Estes Express property.","Lykins Transportation, Inc. (LTI) reviews all incidents, in order, to determine the root cause, preventability, and what actions, i.e. training or procedures, need to be conducted or implemented so that the incident will not happen again. The spill was caused by both the customer’s UST system and the time it took for the driver to notice the spill occurring. LTI conducts driver safety meetings three times a year. During the next round of them in the fall, LTI will brief all drivers about the incident and review with them the importance of being alert at the point of discharge. Having great attentional awareness at the point of discharge truly makes the different when events like happen. Also, for Part III, question 25 the best packing failure code associated with this incident was chosen. Something went wrong internally with the UST system’s remote fill piping and the overfill prevention device. Therefore, human error was chosen because both parties were at fault. The UST system was not properly maintained, and the driver could have noticed the spill occurring much earlier.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,12870,LYKINS TRANSPORTATION INC,US,

The shipment contained dangerous goods (DG) and the proper paper work was completed for the shipment including the shipper's declaration and Notification to the Pilot in Command (NOPIC). 2. The shipment transited through HNL prior to its final destination in LIH.   3. Three (3) pieces containing DG traveled on HA503 HNL-LIH. The required NOPIC for the shipment traveling to LIH was prepared and placed on the HazMat clipboard.  The Cargo runner was notified that the NOPICs were on the clipboard and instructed to retrieve the NOPICs when each shipment was moved to the aircraft. 6. The cargo runner in HNL failed to retrieve the NOPIC from the Hazmat clipboard prior to delivering the shipments to the aircraft.  The root cause of the incident was that the Company's policy on the acceptance and handling of dangerous goods was not properly followed. According to 49 CFR 175.33 - Shipping paper and notification of pilot-in-command: The NOPIC document must be presented to the pilot in command (PIC) for signature and carried onboard the aircraft for the duration of the flight.  Furthermore the HA Cargo Manual Section 7.7.4 states that a NOPIC must be completed and  presented to the load master and PIC. The load master will then present the NOPIC to the PIC once the hazmat has been loaded. The HA Cargo Manual Section 7.7.4.A.1 states that if the shipment is scheduled to make an online transfer, two (2) separate NOPIC forms are to be prepared. The action of separating the NOPIC from the shipment caused the shipment to carried on the aircraft with out the proper notification to the PIC.  There was no failure of the package","The cargo runner and chief on duty were counseled regarding the requirements of the NOPIC being transmitted with the shipments to the aircraft.  Due to the repeated events involving the omission of the required documentation (NOPIC) involving incidents in the HA cargo operations, revised standard operating procedures (SOPs) are being developed to improve the handling and transmittal of hazmat documentation. The SOPs presently being reviewed are to include the following; 1. Upon acceptance of the shipment containing hazmat, the shipment will be placed in a hazmat/dangerous  goods staging area. 2.   All required documents for the shipment placed in the staging area will be provided to the Chief on Duty. 3. Chief agent will verify documentation and approves release of the shipment prior to removal from the  the staging area.

On Monday, 08/13/2018 at 16:30, while unloading a tanker of Techmide 180(Amide C), a warehouse operator noticed that flow completely stopped while filling drum 60 of 60(at 440 lbs of a 480 Ib drum). The operator looked out the window and noticed that the unloading hose was completely disconnected from the tanker, as the locking camlock fitting had one lock that was wom and wouldn't completely close. The operator immediately went outside and closed the internal valve on the tank. The operator reconnected the hose and went back inside to finish unloading the truck. The last drum was completely filled and a tote was placed on the drumming station and filled to 1,440 lbs. However, 2,585 lbs of material had poured from the tanker and into containment. From there, the material flows to the wastewater treatment pond. On 08/14/2018 at 14:20, a call was made to Mark Buckner at Dalton Utilities where Harcros Chemicals Inc. informed him of the spill and that we would discharge our pond water to them and stay within our permitted limits on,pH, COD, and TSS.",The operator was trained on what to look for when getting a locking Camlock fitting to lock on both sides. j,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,2456,"5200 SPEAKER ROAD,",US,

He immediately pulled over to a dirt area off to the side of the on-ramp to the freeway to assess the situation and how best to contain the spill.  Upon inspection, the driver realized that emergency assistance was necessary.  He immediately called 911 to request emergency assistance and then called his Branch Manager to apprise him of the situation.  The Hayward Fire Department and its hazmat response team arrived on scene and contained approximately 300 gallons of KMS-10 (Nitric/Phosphoric Acid blend) that had leaked from tank #3 on the trailer. Details of this response action are provided in the Hayward Fire Department reports identified in item 31 above.  Environmental contractor Clean Harbors was dispatched to remediate the scene. Upon further investigation it was discovered that the pipe had failed at the weld on the outlet pipe on the bottom of the tank.","Inspect all fleet portable tank installations for weld integrity.

The shipment contained dangerous goods (DG) and the proper paper work was completed for the shipment including the shipper's declaration and Notification to the Pilot in Command (NOPIC). 2. The shipment transited through HNL prior to its final destination in LIH.   3. When the shipment was received in HNL, it was split into two (2) separate shipments for movement on separate flights. 4. Two (2) pieces traveled on HA363 HNL-LIH on  16AUG18. 5. The required NOPICs for each shipment traveling to LIH were prepared and placed on the HazMat clipboard. The Cargo runner was  notified that the NOPICs were on the clipboard and instructed to retrieve the NOPICs when each shipment was moved to the aircraft. 6. The cargo runner in HNL failed to retrieve the NOPICs from the Hazmat clipboard prior to delivering the shipments to the aircraft.  The root cause of the incident was that the Company's policy on the acceptance and handling of dangerous goods was not properly followed. According to 49 CFR 175.33 - Shipping paper and notification of pilot-in-command: The NOPIC document must be presented to the pilot in command (PIC) for signature and carried onboard the aircraft for the duration of the flight.  Furthermore the HA Cargo Manual Section 7.7.4 states that a NOPIC must be completed and  presented to the load master and PIC. The load master will then present the NOPIC to the PIC once the hazmat has been loaded. The HA Cargo Manual Section 7.7.4.A.1 states that if the shipment is scheduled to make an online transfer, two (2) separate NOPIC forms are to be prepared. The action of separating the NOPIC from the shipment caused the shipment to carried on the aircraft with out the proper notification to the PIC.  There was no failure of the package","The cargo runner and chief on duty were counseled regarding the requirements of the NOPIC being transmitted with the shipments to the aircraft. Due to the repeated events involving the omission of the required documentation (NOPIC) involving incidents in the HA cargo operations, revised standard operating procedures (SOPs) are being developed to improve the handling and transmittal of hazmat documentation. The SOPs presently being reviewed are to include the following; 1. Upon acceptance of the shipment containing hazmat, the shipment will be placed in a hazmat/dangerous goods staging area. 2. All required documents for the shipment placed in the staging area will be provided to the Chief on Duty. 3. Chief agent will verify documentation and approves release of the shipment prior to removal from the the staging area. An approval notation (green label with employee initials and number) will be applied to the AWB indicating that the documents have been verified. 4.

The shipment contained dangerous goods (DG) and the proper paper work was completed for the shipment including the shipper's declaration and Notification to the Pilot in Command (NOPIC). 2. The cargo shipment was delivered to the aircraft with the NOPIC. 3. The load master (LM) loaded the cargo shipment on the aircraft. 4. At 1531 the flight departed and the LM realized that he had overlooked providing the Pilot in Command (PIC). 5. The Load Planner Chief contacted HA dispatch and an ACARS was sent to the flight to advise of the NOPIC not provided to the PIC and that the DG was loaded in compartment 1.  The specifics of the shipment were provided to the PIC including, position in aircraft, and that the shipment contained UN1845 Dry Ice with a total weight of 42 lbs. (20.4 kg). 6. A confirmation was received by the PIC via ACARS noting the acknowledgement of the DG in the forward compartment and was  received by dispatch via a message from the System Operations Control Center (SOCC) 7. The PIC also received the final load closeout sheet prior to the departure of the aircraft that  indicated the dry ice was loaded in the forward compartment of the aircraft. 8.

The HA Passenger Service Manual (PSM) Section 10.3.1.D. states that after the DG is loaded to the  aircraft the LM must complete the location section of the NOPIC, sign it, obtain the PIC's  signature and leave the original with the PIC.  The Ground Service Manual (GSM) Section G, Chapter 4, Item 3.0 states provides the procedures  for the completion of the NOPIC any time DG is transported on HA flight.  The LM failed to properly follow the HA's procedures which caused the shipment to be  carried on the aircraft without the required NOPIC.","The LM was counseled by the manager on duty on 30AUG2018 regarding the requirements of the NOPIC being presented to the PIC prior to the departure  of the aircraft. A record of corrective action (ROCA) was placed in the LM personnel file.  The LM had received proper Hazmat awareness training and was current on the training.

The local BNSF Hazmat responder was able to assess the car and close the open liquid valve and stop the leak. Hazmat Contractor HMRI and SRS were also dispatched to the location to further assess the valves and closures.

SUTTLE ROAD,PORTLAND,OR,97217,Facility,"AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 AM, AUGUST 2, 2018, I WAS IN THE OFFICE AT INDUSTRIAL OIL IN KLAMATH FALLS. ROUTE DRIVER ED WARNER CAME RUNNING INTO THE OFFICE TO TELL ME THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING “REALLY BAD” HAPPENING WITH THE ROUTE TRUCK (#0675) ON THE LOADING PAD. I IMMEDIATELY WENT OUTSIDE AND NOTICED A YELLOW-BROWN SMOKE OR VAPOR COMING FROM THE FRONT TOP HATCH OF THE CARGO TANK (SEE VIDEO). AFTER A QUICK ASSESSMENT OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION, I DECIDED TO CALL 911.  AT THIS POINT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF COMMOTION GOING ON. PRESENT IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA WERE PLANT WORKERS JOE ALLEN AND ERIK COLLMAN, DRIVERS ED WARNER AND DON RANDALL, AND MYSELF. PLANT MANAGER DAVID ARCHULETA WAS AWAY ON A PARTS RUN. WHILE TALKING WITH THE 911 OPERATOR I SAW ERIK COLLMAN RUNNING FROM THE FAR SIDE OF THE TRUCK TOWARDS THE EYE WASH STATION. I THEN FOUND OUT THAT AFTER STOPPING THE PUMP AND CLOSING THE VALVES, HE WAS TRYING TO UNHOOK THE OFFLOADING HOSE. APPARENTLY THERE HAD BEEN SOME PRESSURE BUILD-UP DURING THE REACTION WHICH CAUSED IT TO BURST OFF THE TRUCK FITTING AND SPRAY HIM IN THE UPPER CHEST AND FACE WITH THE LIQUID. ERIK RINSED HIS EYES THOROUGHLY AT THE EYE WASH STATION, AND JOE ALSO RINSED THEM OUT WITH BOTTLED SALINE SOLUTION. IT APPEARED THAT FIRST AID MEASURES HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN FLUSHING THE MATERIAL FROM ERIK’S EYES, AND ERIK SAID HE WAS OK, BUT BECAUSE OF THE APPARENT REACTION AND CONSEQUENT UNKNOWN NATURE OF THE MATERIAL, I DECIDED TO TAKE ERIK TO THE HOSPITAL FOR FURTHER EVALUATION AND TREATMENT.  WE ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 AM. WHILE ERIK WAS RECEIVING TREATMENT I SPOKE WITH DAVID ARCHULETA, WHO HAD RETURNED TO THE PLANT. HE INFORMED ME THAT EMERGENCY PERSONNEL HAD TAKEN CONTROL OF THE SCENE, EVACUATING ALL PERSONNEL TO THE STOCKYARD PARKING LOT ACROSS THE RAILROAD TRACKS, AND THAT OUR PRESENCE THERE WAS REQUIRED THERE AFTER ERIK’S MEDICAL TREATMENT WAS DONE. WE ARRIVED THERE AT APPROXIMATELY 12:00 PM, WHERE WE WERE UPDATED BY KLAMATH COUNTY FIRE DISTRICT #1 CAPTAIN HELGE MCGEE AND OSP DEPUTY STATE FIRE MARSHAL SCOTT RICE. THEY INFORMED IS THAT THEIR STRATEGY WAS TO WATCH FROM A DISTANCE WITH A SPOTTING SCOPE UNTIL THE TRUCK HAD STOPPED OFF-GASSING, THEN TO TRY AND GET A HEAT READING ON THE TANK. WE WERE RELEASED TO GO GET LUNCH AND RETURNED TO THE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 1:00 PM.  AFTER THE OFF-GASSING STOPPED AND A COUPLE OF HEAT READINGS WERE TAKEN BY EMERGENCY PERSONNEL, WE WERE INFORMED THAT THEY FELT THE REACTION WAS STABILIZED TO THE POINT WHERE THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO TRY AND RETRIEVE A SAMPLE OF THE MATERIAL. WE DIRECTED THEM TO THE LOCATION OF THE DRIVERS CUSTOMER RETAIN A SAMPLE IN THE PLANT (THERE WAS ONLY ONE STOP DONE WITH THE TRCUK THAT DAY), WHICH THEY RETRIEVED AND BEGAN TESTING IN THEIR HAZMAT TRAILER.

Due to proximity to the receiving facility (destination) and the minor release, it was allowed to be placed at the facility for containment and offloading.  BNSF worked with WAUTC inspector and the receiving facility to provide information from the release.  The destination indicated that upon inspection, they noticed a minor leak (few drips per minute) coming from the threads.  They worked to offload the car and removed the cap to determine the integrity of the BOV.  While in the closed position, the BOV had minor seepage past the ball.  The gasket appeared to be in good condition in the cap and workers reported that it was tool tight when they removed the cap.  The shipper was notified to obtain an OTMA for movement from the facility prior to offering back into transportation.",Shipper/car owner should review and ensure that gasket and valve maintenance programs are adequate to capture these defects prior to them occurring while in transportation.

THE BATTERIES WERE TRANSPORTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF 49 CFR 173.159(E). AT 5:00 PM THE DRIVER STOPPED TO CHECK THE LOAD IN RANKIN, TX AND EVERYTHING WAS INTACT. HE PROCEEDED ON HIS WAY AND AT 5:30 PM HE STOPPED TO CHECK HIS LOAD AGAIN IN BIG LAKE, TX AND NOTICED THAT ONE EXIDE EA9 BATTERY WAS MISSING. AT 5:35 PM EMPLOYEE'S SUPERVISOR CALLED AEP ENVIRONMENTAL TO SEEK ADVICE. ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISED THAT THE EMPLOYEE SHOULD RETRACE HIS ROUTE TO LOOK FOR THE LOST BATTERY. ONCE THE DRIVER OBSERVED A BATTERY WAS MISSING HE RE-STRAPPED THE LOAD PRIOR TO RESUMING HIS TRIP. AT 7:00 PM THE EMPLOYEE COMPLETED HIS SEARCH AND FOUND THE CARCASS OF THE BATTERY ON THE DIRT ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF US HWY 67, APPROXIMATELY 14 MILES WEST OF BIG LAKE, TX. THE CASE WAS BROKEN IN TWO PIECES AND ALL OF THE SULFURIC ACID HAD ESCAPED. THIS TYPE OF BATTERY 1.7 GALLONS OF ELECTROLYTE. NO VISIBLE TRACES OF CONTAMINATION WERE APPARENT. THE DRIVER PLACED THE BATTERY REMNANTS IN A SEALED PLASTIC BAG AND RETURNED IT TO THE AEP SAN ANGELO TRANSMISSION YARD. IT IS NOW STORED IN A PLASTIC BAG INSIDE OF A STEEL DRUM PENDING DISPOSAL. A POST-INCIDENT INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT A STRAP AROUND A GROUP OF BATTERIES ON A  WOODEN PALLET HAD LOOSENED DURING TRANSPORT ALLOWING ONE OF THE BATTERIES TO FALL FROM THE TRAILER.","TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF THIS INCIDENT, AEP WILL GATHER INFORMATION FROM OTHER EMPLOYEES WHO TRANSPORT BATTERIES TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES FOR SECURING THE LOAD. IN THE FUTURE BATTERIES PLACED ON WOODEN PALLETS COULD BE BETTER SECURED WITH MORE STRAPS OR THE USE OF CELLOPHANE MATERIAL TO WRAP THE ENTIRE LOAD.

Due to proximity to the receiving facility (destination) and the minor release, it was allowed to be placed at the facility for containment and offloading.  BNSF worked with WAUTC inspector and the receiving facility to provide information from the release.  The destination indicated that upon inspection, they noticed a minor leak (few drips per minute) coming from the threads.  They worked to offload the car and removed the cap to determine the integrity of the BOV.  While in the closed position, the BOV had minor see page past the ball.  The gasket appeared to be in good condition in the cap and workers reported that it was tool tight when they removed the cap.

Upon opening the box we found three round metal friction lid cans. All three cans had can clips vs ring locks for positive closure. The clips on one can failed allowing the friction lid to separate from the can allowing the spill to occur. In addition to the inappropriate Positive Closure, it appeared to me that the shipper used inner packaging that had not been tested with the UN POP box used. In addition to the paint cans was a rectangular plastic bottle& a round plastic jar, each containing other compatible hazmats. The shipment was held pending an FAA inspection.
