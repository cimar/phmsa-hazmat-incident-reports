E-2022030393 While traveling on Hwy 294 a tire on Veolia's trailer blew out causing the driver to pull over at the toll plaza. While inspecting the tire the driver noticed that liquid was leaking from the bottom of the trailer.  Upon inspection it was discovered that a drum on the trailer was squeezed and punctured in the middle of the drum. It is believed that while the shipper was loading the trailer, the forklift drum grabber squeezed the drum which led to the leak. The drum was overpacked so that it could continue safe transport to the destination.  2. E-2022030394 While traveling on Hwy 294 a tire on Veolia's trailer blew out and causing the driver to pull over at the toll plaza. While inspecting the tire it was noticed that some liquid was leaking from the trailer floor.  Further investigation revealed a drum on the trailer was punctured on the bottom causing liquid to leak out of the drum.  The cause of the puncture is unknown but it is suspected it was a nail. The leaking drum was overpacked so that it could safety resume transportation to the destination facility.",1. E-2022030393 The shipper was notified as this most likely occurred while loading the drums causing the drum to be dented by the forklift attachments.  The shipper will be reviewing their loading procedures and addressing this with the employees tasked with loading.    2.

The railcar was isolated, all required notifications made.  CN Response team responded and observed a strong petroleum like odor when approaching the railcar.  A drip leak was observed coming from the area of the bottom outlet valve. Liquid was observed streaming down the body of the bottom outlet valve and onto the ground. The cause of the release was determined to be that the bottom outlet valve handle packing gland bolts had backed out which allowed the packing gland to become dislodged from the valve body. The bottom outlet valve handle packing gland was pushed back into the valve body and the bolts were tightened, which secured the leak.

The railcar was isolated, all required notifications made.  CN Response team responded and observed liquid on the side of the railcar near the side ladder access.  Upon closer inspection, when climbing the railcar, liquid was observed coming down the railcar manway nozzle, then onto the sides of the railcar.  The manway swing bolts were checked and found to be tool tight and secured by a security seal.  The security seal was removed and the manway opened.  The manway gasket was found to be misaligned. A new manway nozzle gasket was installed and the manway swing bolts were properly tightened, which secured the leak.

Upon Allied's arrival, the super sack of concern was identified and then visually assessed. The assessment resulted in the observation of product spillage from a torn super sack. Allied advised that 1,000 pounds of product were released to an 8' by 10' area of the trailer floor. The cause of the tear, according to the responding contractor, was due to a shift off of the corner of the pallet, which likely caused the super sack to get caught on a protruding nail when the cargo shifted due to the underlying pallet being too small for the super sack that was loaded. Spilled material was subsequently collected and the contents of the supersack were transferred into a new supersack. Media affected was limited to trailer flooring components. At 1745 ET, Allied completed operations and departed the site with (1) 55-gallon poly drum of released product and PPE.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED,Yes,BAG PLASTIC,Plastic bag (cont1 for solid materials),BAG PLS,No,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,6000,ERTS,US,
