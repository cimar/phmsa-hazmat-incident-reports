The shipper could not advise responders on O-ring compatability type.     Tank car found later leaking from PRD while at Roodhouse, IL. Responder concluded shipper applied incompatible Oring type and re-applied neoprene O-ring.     File Note Item 19 - the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27 - Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:  The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

There was a strong acetone smell eminating from the bag. When the duffle bag was unzipped, some of the liquid contents from a couple of containers inside the bags had spilled out. The duffle bag had been wrapped in plastic, so the spilled liquid was contained inside the bag. It was determined that the contents inside the bag were nail polish paint. The nail polish paint had been bottled in medicine bottles of different sizes (totalling approximately 452 Fluid ounces). These bottles had been taped back and sealed to desguise their true content. At first sight it gave the impression that the bottles contained the medicine portrayed on the boxes and labels, but after close inspection, it was discovered that the original content had been replaced with nail polish paint. The items were confiscated and reported to the FAA.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder was notified and immediately inspected ACFX 79721. The responder reported finding the liquid valve closed but loose on its threaded pipe flange connection.  The responder tool tightened the loose valve on its threaded connection with a pipe wrench. Afterwards, the responder noticed a small amount of liquid escaping from the liquid line's bolted pipe flange connection below the valve. The tool tight flange bolt nuts were removed to inspect the flange gasket. The flange gasket appeared 'flattened' and sealant was applied around the flange connection to ensure a good seal at this bolted flange connection. The flange bolt nuts were reapplied and tool tightened. The valve connection was monitored and no further product leakage was observed. All spillage evaporated and no ground impact from spillage was noted. Intact shipper seal SLS JACKSON, NE 0026161at the valve housing cover was replaced with BNSF seal 06157446.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

He pulled over on the side of the road just north of exit 12.  The nose of the trailer was loaded with a load rack on its side to keep the first 4 feet of the trailer without a tote in the nose, then there was 1 tote loaded in the middle behind the load rack, then the next 6 totes were loaded side by side on the trailer.  there was no evidence that lack of blocking caused any impact to the spouts to cause them to leak.  There were 2 leaking stainless steel totes, with approximately 375 gallons in each.  The two totes lost approximately 1/3 of the liquid contained within for an approximate total of 250 gallons.  All of the spouts were facing the nose of the trailer.      Fire department on scene during cleanup procedures completed by outside vendor.

Ingram discovered tank car UTLX 201286, load, Gasoline, to be leaking down the sides of the car from the top in a cascading fashion.  SA Ingram notified CR, the operator of the yard.    CR Risk Management dispatched emergency response contractor Hepaco-React to inspect and mitigate.  Further inspection by Hepaco-React noted the 3"" liquid valve (threaded onto the mounting plate) had been removed/stolen; and the closure plug for the 1"" air valve was removed but valve was closed.  Leak originating from the opening created by the removal of the liquid valve.    Hepaco-React opened the air valve to vent off pressure, which allowed the car to cease leaking.  The missing 3"" stainless liquid valve was replaced in kind (supplied by Hepaco-React); and the air valve closure plug was reapplied tool tight.      Ground effected by release of product, estimated at 100 gallons, was removed by Hepaco-React, and is staged at the site for eventual removal/disposal.    CR will apply for OTMA request to have the car shipped to original destination, Kinder Morgan, Philadelphia, PA, without benefit of valves being leak tested, so the car can be unloaded and further leak tested on site, or, have the car forwarded to a, as yet, designated shop for required leak test of the newly applied valve.

The railcar was moved into position at the facility for unloading on Wednesday, July 11, 2012.  Operations personnel began the process of inspection and equipment set-up when they noticed spray / splatter on the top & sides of the railcar.  The manway & dip-tube dome seals were in place and not broken.  During the initial investigation, it appears some material was released from the pressure relief valve on the top of the railcar.  The product on the railcar was completely dry, indicating the release occurred during transport to the facility.  It does not appear the pressure relief valve failed, but rather, the release could be attributed to excessive / sudden movement of the car during transport to the Syngenta facility.  Therefore, the cause of failure was identified as 'Human Error'.",Railcar was unloaded at the facility & was delivered to Nebraska Railcar Cleaning Company for decontamination and verification the pressure relief valve is not damaged.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Syngenta Crop Protection, LLC",US,

Contractor personnel inspected the gasket and secured the bolts for the vent assembly and cleaned up spilled material. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

Dodge pickup was East bound on U.S. 64 approaching the U.S. 283 JCT.  For an unknown reason Haz-mat vehicle driver failed to see Dodge pickup, and turned in front of Dodge pickup.  Dodge pickup could not avoid collision.  Dodge pickup struck haz-mat vehicle in the passenger side fuel tank.  The fuel tank on haz-mat vehicle ruptured and ignited causing both vehicles involved to burn.  The haz-mat vehicle driver exited his vehicle and accessed his fire extinguisher and observed the passenger of pickup trying to exit the vehicle.  The hazmat vehicle driver utilized his fire extinguisher to try to hold the flames at bay and simultaneously help the passenger out of the vehicle.  After helping the passenger from the Dodge pickup, the haz-mat driver fully exhausted his fire extinguisher, and was unable to reach the driver who was apparently critically injured and pinned in the collision.  The fire department arrived and extricated the driver of the Dodge pickup using the jaws of life.  The fire department extinguished the fire and kept the cargo tank cool with water.  No product was released from the cargo tank as a result of the accident or fire, but the cargo tank was damaged.",The cause of this incident is currently under investigation.

Four tank cars containing the residue of Petroleum Gases, Liquefied were noted on a track in close proximity to where he was located.  CR Risk Manager A. Richter notified by Pavonia Yardmaster.    Upon arrival at yard office, a yard conductor moving locomotives in same area also noted similiar odor of gas.  Further inspection of all four LPG tank cars by CR's Richter noted tank car GATX 209470, containing the residue of Petroleum Gases, Liquefied (Butane), was leaking vapor by the ""B"" end liquid valve due to the valve not being completely closed; and, the closure plug for said valve not being even hand tight.  Valve closed and closure plug made tool tight by CR's Richter.  Car okayed for movement to final destination.      A green seal, marked as ""INERGY-SJT 0002326"" was noted laying alongside the outside of the protective housing.  However, no evidence that it was applied at one time and cut, tampered or removed to gain access to the valves inside the housing.  The seal was in ""new"" condition when examined.  It appears the seal was never applied to the protective housing prior to shipment.    NOTE: The other 3 tank cars containing residue of LPG (GATX 203075, NATX 400366 and GATX 30664) were all noted to have been sealed with similar seals noted on the unsecured seal of the leaking tank car.

Our driver inspected the trailer and confirmed that a cleanout port cap (cover) on the top of the trailer had become dislodged and was hanging by its tether.  He contacted QC's 24/7 response center, who dispatched a hazardous material contractor to the site.  As the port is at the top of the tank, product ceased spilling when the trailer was stationary and level.  The contractor cleaned the product from the trailer and the highway.  The cover was replaced, and secured.     Investigation revealed that the shipper had installed a cam-lock fitting on a cleanout port to facilitate loading, and closed the opening with a cam-lock cover.  Procedure was to load, replace the cover and seal the ears in the closed position, which provides a secondary lock to the cover.  The fitting is no longer being used for loading, so the seal application was no longer part of the loading procedure.  The seal had been removed at some time prior to this shipment, and road vibration appears to have allowed the cover ears to move, dislodging the cover from the trailer.",The cam-lock fittings will be replaced with conventional threaded cleanout caps.

As the employee was opening the product valve on a railcar (# UTLX 75418), approximately 10 gallons of liquid asphalt spewed out of the false dome lid opening, ran down the railcar sides, and dripped into the ballast between the rails and also onto the asphalt road in-between rail tracks. Pressure built up in the railcar from heating the railcar with steam lines. The steam was immediately shut-off to the railcar. Upon further investigation, it has been determined that pressure built up in the railcar due to a leak in the product hose line trace. After product cooled, it was scraped off the asphalt and ballast and disposed of.","The asphalt product hose was replaced with a new more durable hose. Transload employees were instructed to increase diligence when inspecting product hoses before use for any signs or leaks from the product hose.

The visual inspection of the floating gauge showed the float was still all the way down indicating there was plenty of room left in the railcar for liquid asphalt to be loaded. As the load proceeded longer than normal, the TRANSFLO manager climbed up on top of the railcar to visually check the volume of liquid asphalt that had been loaded into the railcar. As he got to the second rung from the top of the railcar, liquid asphalt started coming out of the top of the railcar. The floating gauge had failed to operate as designed. The pump was shut off immediately, but about 20 gallons of liquid asphalt was released from the railcar due to overfilling the package. There were no injuries to manager climbing the railcar and no drains were impacted. The release was completely contained. Once asphalt cooled and solidified, it was immediately cleaned up and properly disposed of.","The float system devised for use on this transfer was not a proven monitoring method. The float system failed to function as it was intended. The float system was the only means to gauge outage on this transfer.    Actions Taken:  1)A new metered pump has been ordered for this transfer and will be put into service when received.   2) The terminal will continue to only place three trailer loads into railcar until other method can be proven to measure outage, in addition to use of the metered pump.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Kinder Morgan Materials Services,US,

THE INCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN SIMPLOT EMPLOYEES WERE OFF LOADING SULFURIC ACID FROM THE RAILCAR. AN OPERATOR ATTACHED THE AIR FITTING AND UNLOADING FITTINGS TO THE RAILCAR TO UNLOAD THE CAR INTO A SULFURIC ACID STORAGE TANK T-115. AIR PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO THE RAILCAR TO PUSH ACID OUT OF THE RAILCAR TO THE STORAGE TANK. THE DISCHARGE VALVE ON THE RAILCAR UNLOADING HOSE WAS OPENED AND ACID STARTED TO FLOW.  THE OPERATOR IMMEDIATELY NOTICED A LEAK BETWEEN SIMPLOT'S UNLOADING HOSE FITTING AND THE FITTING ON THE RAILCAR. THE OPERATOR SHUT OFF THE AIR SUPPLY TO THE RAILCAR BUT DID NOT BLEED THE PRESSURE OFF THE CAR. HE THEN ATTEMPTED TO TIGHTEN THE FITTING TO STOP THE LEAK, THE FITTING CAME OFF THE RAILCAR UNLOADING STATION. THIS CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS REMOVED AND PROPERLY DISPOSED OF. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AND WYOMING DEPARTMENT OF WATER QUALITY (WDEQ)WERE NOTIFIED SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.    THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED TWO CAUSES FOR THIS INCIDENT. FIRST, THE OPERATOR SHOULD NOT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TIGHTEN THE ACID FITTING WHILE THE RAILCAR WAS PRESSURIZED. SECOND, THE THREADS ON THE UNLOADING FITTING THAT THE SIMPLOT EMPLOYEE USED TO CONNECT THE UNLOADING HOSE TO THE RAILCAR WERE WORN AND DID NOT ALLOW THE FITTING TO BE TIGHTENED. THE WORN FITTING WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE. (THE FITTINGS ON THE RAILCAR WERE IN GOOD CONDITION IT WAS THE SIMPLOT INSTALLED FITTING THAT HAD THE WORN THREADS AND THAT IS THE FITTING THAT FAILED). TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE, SIMPLOT IS REVIEWING THE INCIDENT WITH ALL OF THE RAIL YARD EMPLOYEES AND IS EVALUATION A PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM TO THE UNLOADING FITTINGS.","TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE, SIMPLOT IS REVIEWING THE INCIDENT WITH ALL OF THE RAIL YARD EMPLOYEES AND IS EVALUATING A PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM FOR THE UNLOADING FITTINGS.",Yes,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,SIMPLOT PHOSPHATES LLC,US,

Upon securing the area, the doors of the intermodal container were opened and it was observed that the drums of chromic acid had shifted and some had been damaged. Upon surveying the area it did not appear that any material had been released. The intermodal container was then uprighted and readied for shipment back to the carriers facility. At this point, it was noticed that a small drip was coming from the intermodal container. Less than 10 oz. was released, this was immediately cleaned up, the leak was stopped, and the container was transported back to the carrier's facility for transloading purposes",Througout this process many errors were identified.  The shipper from Turkey has been instructed to no longer ship this product with a void in the nose of the container.  It has also been discussed with the shipper from Turkey to no longer stack these drums and to use a fourty foot container.

It was discovered that the trailer was leaking afterwards.  We pulled the pallet out of the trailer (4 drums on one pallet), it was on the floor on the right side next to the other pallets of drums in the order.  We lifted the pallet up and Supervisor saw that one of the drums had slid into the corner of one of the pieces of wood that made up the bottom of the pallet.  The drum was indented at the point where it was clearly pinched into the bottom of the pallet, and there was a pen sized hole that was leaking; it might have been 15-20 minutes before it was discovered.  Supervisor determined that, while loading, the drum that was leaking had managed to shift just slightly enough to get pinched into the bottom of the pallet.  Supervisor looked to see if there was any way a fork lift blade could have sneaked up there, but that didn't look possible.  Also, the drum was clearly wedged into the bottom of the pallet where it was leaking.  This was in no way the fault of the loader, and the shipper didn't do anything negligent either.  Somehow the drum, which had come back to our dock without leaking, had managed to rub against the edge of the bottom piece of wood on the pallet enough to cause a puncture.  Since the pallet was leaking onto the dock after it was pulled out, Supervisor immediately had it loaded into a haz-mat container to minimize the spillage.",,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Con-way Freight,US,

At 1444 the driver heard a noise from the top of the trailer and determined that the pressure relief valve was lifting.  Facility personnel were notified immediately and responded by securing the area and monitoring with a 4-gas monitor. The atmosphere surrounding the cargo tank was determined to be safe to transfer the LPG liquid back to its source. The product loaded on the trailer was immediately transferred to the origin facility using the liquid pump on the LPG transport.  After removing the LPG from the cargo tank,  the relief valve reseated and the transport was removed from the scene. Upon removal from the cargo tank,  the failed pressure relief valve was found to have several cracks in the operating spring.  The valve had been installed originally in June 2009 and was expected to work without failure for at least 5 years.

As the transfer was occurring the employee noticed a small drip of liquid at the trailer connection. The employee stopped the transfer process, and followed the standard operating procedure of blowing out the product hose going to the trailer. When the employee went to adjust the connection from the hose to the trailer unloading spout, liquid product was quickly released from the hose.  Upon review, it was determined the employee had failed to remove the bottom cap on the trailer unloading spout. This employee was new and despite being properly trained on this transfer, the employee failed to inspect the bottom cap of on the unloading spout to ensure the cap had been removed.  There was no damage or defects to the transfer hose or on either package (railcar or trailer). This release was caused by human error. No drains were impacted. The spill was contained, cleaned up, and properly disposed of.",Corrective Actions:   1.

It appears that the railcar had been overloaded with asphalt at its origin and when the railcar was heated with steam (prior to unloading) the product had expanded. Since the railcar has been overloaded, the expansion of asphalt during heating forced the asphalt out of the top dome lid that was vented. Approximately 15 gallons of asphalt ran down the side of the railcar and dripped onto the ground. Asphalt in tailcar was unloaded to a lower level to stop the leak. Asphalt on the ground and railcar was allowed to cool and then was scraped up and properly disposed of.",The original shipper was notified that railcar had been loaded with an excessive amount product to allow for expansion when heated with steam prior to transfer. TRANSFLO is working with shipper to ensure railcar is shipped with a minimum level of outage to ensure product expansion will not result in a release. Also TRANSFLO operators will now visually check level of asphalt in the railcar prior to heating to ensure there is enough outage (headspace in railcar) to allow for product expansion.

The cargo in question contained 8 boxes of Petroleum Distillates, N.O.S. and 1 box of Environmentally Hazardous Substance liquid. The Shipper's  Dangerous Goods Declaration is attached as Exhibit A. Expeditors-SFO subcontracted a service provider (California Sierra Trucking) to pick up the cargo in question from Volcano Corporation's location for transfer to Expeditors-SFO's air cargo facility. At approximately 02:35 on July 31, 2012, California Sierra Trucking delivered the subject cargo to Expeditors-SFO's air cargo warehouse facility.  During the offload and freight check in process, 1 box of Petroleum Distillate, N.O.S., was accidentally dropped and the contents of the box leaked. Absorbent material was administered to prevent further spread of the dangerous material. Photographs of the spill are attached as Exhibit B. Following the spill, the emergency contact number on the Shipper's  Dangerous Goods Declaration  was called to seek guidance on next steps. A Dangerous Goods clean up company was recommended (Clean Harbors Environmental Services). Expeditors-SFO contacted Clean Harbors Environmental Services to schedule an appointment to have the spilled hazardous materials removed. The spilled Petroleum Distillate, N.O.S., was cleaned up on July 31, 2012.","On July 31, 2012, both Expeditors-SFO  and Expeditors'  Corporate (""Expeditors-CHQ) management  were alerted of the situation. Expeditors does not package inner contents of Dangerous Goods and is not apprised with all ICAO technical requirements of the hazardous substance in question. Immediately following the discovery, Volcano Corporation's management  was contacted for a discussion about their hazardous materials procedures and dangerous goods packaging practices. During the hazmat removal process, Expeditors-SFO requested that Clean Harbors Environmental  Services review the inner contents of the box to  ensure that the declared packing instruction was followed. Upon review of the events leading up to hazardous materials spill, no extraordinary defects were discovered with the handling or with the packaging of the Dangerous Goods cargo. In an effort to lessen the possibility of reoccurrence, a discussion has been had with all dangerous goods certified warehouse employees to discuss the events of this hazardous spill and to reiterate the importance of careful handling of Dangerous Goods cargo.",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,EXPEDITORS INTL OF WASHINGTON,US,

This truck and trailer driven by Driver Carl Parliament was involved in a traffic accident in Dallas, TX on 07/25/2012. The truck and trailer were rendered inoperable, and Triad Driver Ron Estep was dispatched to the accident scene to transfer the load to Trailer No. 129. This was done at the scene of the accident under the supervision of the Texas Highway Patrol,Harris Co.Sheriff Dept.,Dallas Fire Dept. HazMat Response Team, and Protect Environmental Services Inc. All valves, and dome lids were secured at the scene prior to leaving. This is a vacuum tank,and dome lids had to be secured in order to pull a vacuum and load the trailer. After transferring the load, Ron Estep continued on and delivered to Ash Grove Cement in Foreman,AR.    Mr.Estep delivered the load on 07/26/2012. Prior to unloading after arrival employees of Ash Grove Cement opened the dome lid on the tank,and took samples of the cargo. Apparently before moving the tank to the unloading area they did not secure the dome lid adequately,and when the driver braked,a small amount of product was sloshed out onto the pavement near the unloading area. Ash Grove Cement reported the spill to the National Response Center. They did not report it to Triad Transport, nor did the driver. The spill was cleaned up with absorbent,and was contained entirely to the concrete paved unloading area. This driver has resigned and no longer works for Triad Transport since then.    Triad Transport learned of the incident on 09/18/2012 when contacted by Gail Twitty of DOT, for follow up information.
