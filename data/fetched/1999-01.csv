Several drops of the product hit the IC carman on the nose and right hand. The car man, believing it was water or snow off the top of the car, laced up the train and was walking back to the yard office when the spots on his nose and hand began to burn. The car man called for a supervisor and began washing off the areas on his hand and nose with soap and water. When the supervisor arrived he took the carman to a local hospital where he was given first aid by washing the areas with soap and water and then a burn cream was applied. Doctor released the car man back to full duty and told him to follow up with his own doctor in a few days. Tank car was isolated awaiting a test of the safety relief valve.

I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM MY ASSISTANT KELLY BUENNING AT MY HOME AT APPROXIMATELY 7:10 P.M. ON THURSDAY EVENING 1/28/99.  KELLY ADVISED ME THAT N&M DRIVER CRAIG OWENS HAD JUST REPORTED TO HER AN INCIDENT INVOLVING A LEAKING DRUM WITHIN HIS TRAILER.  APPARENTLY CRAIG OWENS HAD AVOIDED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT (20 MINUTES EARLIER) BY BRAKING EXTREMELY HARD WHILE TRAVELING ON HIGHWAY 41 THROUGH GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN.  CRAIG'S TRAILER WAS LOADED 3/4 FULL ON THE FLOOR, WITH JUST 12 FEET OPEN ON THE BACK.  THE FIRST QUARTER OF HIS TRAILER CONTAINED CRATES ON ONE SIDE  OF THE NOSE AND SKIDS OF PAPER THROUGH OUT THE REST OF THE FIRST QUARTER.  DIRECTLY BEHIND THE CRATES HOWEVER HE PLACED ONE DRUM OF SODIUM HYDROXIDE  SOLUTION.  HE HAD THE DRUM PUSHED UP TIGHT AGAINST THE CRATES IN THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER, BUT ONE HEAVY SKID OF PAPER WAS LOADED BEHIND IT WITH A GAP OF ABOUT 6 INCHES AWAY FROM THE DRUM.  THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER OF THE TRAILER CONTAINED EXTREMELY HEAVY METAL CASTING.  AFTER SPEAKING WITH KELLY BUENNING FOR SEVERAL MINUTES I GAVE HER SOME INITIAL PROCEDURES TO FOLLOW.  SHE CONTACTED ME AGAIN ABOUT 7:20 P.M. WITH THE DRIVER ALSO ON THE LINE.  WE CONTACTED OUR OWN COMPANY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM AND HAD THEM RESPOND TO THE SPILL.  (THIS APPLETON PAPERS LOCATION IS APPROXIMATELY 12 MILES FROM OUR TERMINAL).  I ALSO HAD KELLY CONTACT CHEM-TREC.  CHEM-TREC ADVISED US THAT THE SHIPPER WAS REGISTERED WITH THEM, BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FAX OVER AN MSDS BECAUSE THIS SHIPPER HAS OVER TWENTY DIFFERENT HAZARDOUS MATERIAL PRODUCTS WITH THE SAME (UN/NA IDENTIFICATION NUMBER.  IN THE FUTURE, MOTOR CARRIERS WHO HANDLE THIS SHIPPER'S FREIGHT WILL HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS OBTAINING AN MSDS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LIST A PRODUCT NUMBER, TRADE NAME,  OR ANY OTHER DESCRIPTION WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS FROM EACH OTHER.  ( I THINK DOT SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON THIS!)  CHEM-TREE EVENTUALLY NOTIFIED THE SHIPPER'S CONTACT AT HOME AND THAT PERSON GAVE US SOME VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO HANDLE THE SPILL.  THE CONTACT PERSON ALSO ADVISED THAT AN MSDS WAS ATTACHED TO THE DRUM.  (WRITTEN EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION ON THE EXTERIOR OF LEAKING CONTAINERS IN NOT ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE, AND IT DOES NOT AT ALL HELP RESPONSE TEAM MEMBERS DURING A SPILL INCIDENT!!)  SOME SEEPAGE FROM THE LEAKING DRUM STRUCK GROUND SURFACE FROM OUT THE BACK DOOR OF THE TRAILER.  WHILE OUR DRIVER WAS WAITING FOR THE TEAM TO ARRIVE, HE APPLIED ABSORBENT PADS TO AT THE AREA OF THE GROUND THAT WAS CONTAMINATED.   OUR RESPONSE TEAM ARRIVED WITHIN 30 MINUTES OF THE CALL.  THEY APPLIED A NEUTRALIZING AGENT TO THE SPILL AREA WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE TRAILER, EXTERIOR OF THE TRAILER, AND GROUND SURFACE.  NO SPILLAGE GOT IN TO ANY SEWERS, DRAIN PIPES, OR WATER WAYS.

CAPTAIN MAY DIRECTED HIS DISPATCH TO CALL AND TELL SOMEONE TO BRING A TANKER SO THAT THE LEAKING TANKER COULD BE OFF LOADED.  WE WERE NOT SURE WHAT WE WOULD FIND WHEN WE ARRIVED ON THE LOCATION, THEREFORE WE CALLED MR. BRADFORD OF BRADFORD WRECKER SERVICE TO RESPOND IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEEDED HIS SERVICES.  DAVID NALL DELIVERED A TRUCK AND TANKER TO THE SITE.  UPON ARRIVAL, DAVID WAS INFORMED BY CAPTAIN MAY THAT WE COULD NOT MOVED THE EQUIPMENT BECAUSE HE WAS CONCERNED THAT THE TANK WOULD RUPTURE.  AT THIS POINT MR. BALL SAID THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PRESSURIZE THE TANK TO TRANSFER THE LOAD.  MR. BALL INFORMED DAVID THAT WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO STAND BY UNTIL THE TANKER EMPTIED THROUGH THE LEAK.  MR. BALL MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE TANK WOULD BE UNLOADED OR SOLIDIFIED BEFORE WE LEFT THE SIDE.  AFTER ROD AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SURVEY THE SITUATION, I REQUESTED THAT MR. BALL ALLOW US TO PUT AIR PRESSURE FROM THE TRUCK COMPRESSOR ON THE TANK TO SEE IF WE COULD INCREASE THE RATE OF FLOW.  THIS WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL.  AT THIS TIME I REQUESTED OF MR. BALL THAT WE BE ALLOWED TO REMOVED THE VALVE FROM THE TANK, SINCE THE VALVE WAS FROZEN AND WOULD NOT ALLOW SULFUR TO FLOW THROUGH.  AFTER REMOVING THE VALVE, WE USED A LONG STEEL ROD TO BREAK THE APPROXIMATELY 6"" PLUG IN THE DISCHARGE LINE.  AFTER REMOVAL OF THIS PLUG, THE TRUCK WAS UNLOADED IN APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES.  PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF ANYONE FROM THE TIGER-SUNBELT RESPONSE TEAM, THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION SENT IN SOMEONE WITH A BACK-HOE TO BUILD A DAM IN THE DITCH TO CONFINE THE AREA IN WHICH THE SULFUR COULD FLOW.  AFTER THE TRUCK WAS UNLOADED, MR. BALL INFORMED  US THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE AREA UNTIL THE SULFUR HAD SOLIDIFIED.  AT THIS POINT, TROOPER BUCKHALTER TOLD US THAT HE COULD GET HIS BROTHER TO WATCH THE SITE FOR US.  WHEN CONTACTED, ANTHONY BUCKHAULTER AGREED TO STAY UNTIL 1:00 A.M. FOR A FEE OF $70.00.  THIS WAS ACCEPTABLE WITH MR. BALL.  WE LEFT THE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 P.M. SUBJECT:  MAGEE, MISSISSIPPI SULFUR SPILL ON JANUARY 23, 1999 TIGER-SUNBELT DRIVER MIKE STUART LOADED HIS MOLTEN SULFUR TANKER AT JOHNS ENERGY IN JOHNS, MISSISSIPPI FOR A DELIVERY TO MISSISSIPPI PHOSPHATE IN PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI. WHILE TRAVELING SOUTH ON HIGHWAY 49, APPROXIMATELY THREE MILES NORTH OF MAGEE, MISSISSIPPI, MIKE WAS NOTIFIED ON HIS RADIO BY A TRUCK DRIVER THAT HIS TANKER WAS LEAKING. HE IMMEDIATELY PULLER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  MIKE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE ANSWERING SERVICE THAT HE HAD AN EMERGENCY. ATTACHED IS A CHRONOLOGICAL LIST OF THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN RESPONSE TO THE SITUATION.

SPECIAL AGENT DENNIS COOKSEY DURING A ROLL BY INSPECTION OF THE TRAIN, OBSERVED LIQUID DRIPPING FROM THE ABOVE CONTAINER, AND THE TRAIN STOPPED ON THE MAIN LINE TO INVESTIGATE. AS THE CONTAINER WAS PLACARDED FLAMMABLE, AGENT COOKSEY CONTACTED RMCC AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT. MANAGER COOPER WAS CONTACTED AND WHILE ENROUTE TO THE AREA, WAS ADVISED BY AGENT COOKSEY THAT THE NEXT WESTWARD SIDING, SALVIA, MP592, WAS OCCUPIED WITH MAINTENANCE OF WAY EQUIPMENT AND THE TRAIN COULD NOT BE MOVED TO THE SIDING TO PROTECT THE MAINLINE. WHILE DISCUSSING THE PARTICULARS OF THE RELEASE, AGENT COOKSEY ADVISED THE CATHEDRAL CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD ARRIVE ON SCENE. CONTACT WAS MADE WITH THE TRAIN MANAGEMENT DISPATCHERS, WHO WERE ADVISED ALL TRAIN TRAFFIC WOULD BE HALTED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE REMEDIATION. MANAGER COOPER MET WITH THE CATHEDRAL CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TEAM ON SITE AND ADDRESSED THE HAZARDOUS COMMODITIES ON BOARD THE CONTAINER. AS THE CONTAINER WAS ON THE BOTTOM TIER OF A DOUBLE STACK WELL CAR (TTAX 76542) ACCESS TO THE REAR DOORS WAS OBTAINED AS THE 40 FOOT CONTAINER WAS IN A 48 FOOT CAR. THE RIVERSIDE FIRE DEPARTMENT TEAM MADE ENTRY AND LOCATED ONE DRUM IN THE N OSE OF THE CONTAINER THAT HAD TOPPLED OVER. SINCE MOST OF THE PRODUCT HAD ESCAPED FROM THE DRUM, THEY RIGHTED THE DRUM WHICH STOPPED LEAK. THE RAILROADS HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CONTRACTOR ARRIVED ON SITE AND REMOVED THE DRUM, WHERE IT WAS PATCHED AND PLACED INTO AN OVERPACK FOR SECUREMENT. SINCE THE ENTIRE FLOOR OF THE CONTAINER WAS COVERED WITH PRODUCT, ABSORBENT WAS PLACED THROUGHOUT TO CONTAIN THE FREE LIQUIDS. AN EMPTY DUMMY DRUM WAS PLACED IN THE NOSE TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED DRUM, AND THE REMAINING DRUMS WERE SECURED WITH STRETCH WRAP TO PREVENT ANY ADDITIONAL MOVEMENT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS SATISFIED WITH THE CONTAINMENT AND RELEASED THE TRAIN FOR MOVEMENT INTO COLTON. THE CONTAINER WAS DESTINED FOR THE EAST YARD, CITY OF COMMERCE, WHERE IT WAS GROUNDED UPON ARRIVAL. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, RAIL CAR WAS CLEANED OF THE RESIDUE, AND THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE CONTAINER WERE REMOVED AND REWORKED. A CLOSER INSPECTION OF THE LADING IN THE NOSE OF THE CONTAINER DEVELOPED A PALLET OF 4 DRUMS HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE RIGHT FRONT CORNER OF THE CONTAINER WITH NO FORM OF SECUREMENT. THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE, NOR IS IT AN APPROVED METHOD FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS PER THE AAR BOE 6C. THERE WAS A VOID TO THE CENTER OF THE CONTAINER, AND THE DAMAGED DRUM HAD TOPPLED FROM THE PALLET AND LEANED INTO THE ADJACENT FREIGHT, WHICH DAMAGED THE DRUM.
