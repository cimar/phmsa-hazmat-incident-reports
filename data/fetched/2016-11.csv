Prior to calling ERTS, the terminal personnel overpacked the one pail that was leaking into a 20 gallon poly drum.

The car inspector found an odor coming from this car as he was inspecting the inbound train.  When I investigated, I found that the liquid valve was leaking through the valve plug.  The valve was tight and still leaking through.  The plug valve was less than tool tight.  I tightened the plug and the leak stopped.  I contacted Markwest and advised them of the leak and they sent Sunpro out to look at the valve at our yard.  They came out on 2-9-2016 and determined that the liquid valve was faulty and needed replaced.  They ordered a new valve.  Sunpro came into our yard on 2-17-2016 and replaced the valve and tested it with nitrogen.  The repaired passed a bubble test.

The cause of the release was initially unknown.  The tote released approximately 4 gallons of material to the trailer floor and approximately 1 gallon released to the concrete parking lot.  No soils, drains or waterways were impacted by the release.  An environmental contractor was dispatched to clean the area and secure the leaking tote.  Upon arrival, the contractor discovered that the bottom valve of the tote was partially open which caused the release.  It was determined that the valve handle was accidentally struck during unloading of the trailer causing it to open slightly.  The valve was closed and secured.  The tote, its seams and closures were inspected and it was determined the source of the release was in fact the open valve.  The impacted areas of trailer floor and concrete were cleaned with granular absorbents.  All waste was taken offsite for disposal.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Gibson Gas, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report 2016-11-12-00080).  Joe Caccamo , a CSXT hazardous materials manager, climbed the car to investigate the odor and found product leaking from a liquid line valve that was not in closed position and secondary securement plug less than tool tight.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative (Charlene 403-969-6400).  The liquid line valve was closed and the secondary securement plug installed wrench tight.  The car was released for transportation.  No Special switching move was required.

The employee stated that a very strong odor was coming from the GATX 17174. The car was a residue car that last contained Sodium Sulfide Solutions Spent, Containing Sodium Hydroxide (STCC 4936653).  The detectable odor by the residue in the car was caused by a deteriorated and defective manway gasket which was replaced by BNSF hazmat responders.  The car was properly secured and departed the terminal without further delay.  No car contamination or environmental clean up was required. No injuries were reported and no waterways were impacted.  The quantity released shown in item 19 is an estimated value.",This was a preventable NAR which can be avoided with proper attention given to quality inspection and pre-trip processes at the loading/unloading terminal.  All primary and secondary closures including manway gaskets should be inspected and replaced if found defective.

At the cleanup, the crew removed all the PCB oils from the transformers, and filled the emptied transformer casings with absorbents to solidify any remaining oil residue. One of transformer lids was bent slightly, and could not provide a tight seal with its gasket. The transformers were not placed in approved UN rated plastic transformer bags or over pack drum. Our crew transported these waste transformers back to the branch, where they would be placed in temporary containment/storage till shipped to the final destination.  While in containment/temporary storage at the branch, the transformers were incorrectly placed on their sides, not upright. This, combined with the bent lid, led to a small leak of unabsorbed transformer oil. The leakage was reported the next morning, where facility personnel then donned the appropriate personal protective equipment, and remediated the small spill using absorbent pads and granulated absorbent material. The generated waste from the cleanup was placed in an already manifested PCB containing waste drum from the original emergency cleanup event. The spill was reported to the reported to New York State DEC at 13:40 11/23/16, report # 1608209, operator #585 David.","We have retrained the crew, driver, and facility personnel in the correct way to prepare waste transformers for transit, the correct UN rated packaging for transformers and when they need to use it, and the correct way to store waste transformers.
