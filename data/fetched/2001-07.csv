LOADED IN CINCINNATI AND DELIVERED TO CHARTER STEEL IN RISINGSUN, OH. SOMETIME AFTER THE LOAD WAS DELIVERED, A CHARTER STEEL EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED THAT THEIR HOLDING TANK HAD OVERFLOWED THROUGH ITS VENT AND PRODUCT SPILLED ONTO THE GROUND THROUGH THE VENT PIPING.THERE WAS MINOR DAMAGE TO THE EXTERIOR OF THE BUILDING AND POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO TWO CARS THAT WERE PARKED BENEATH THE VENT PIPE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT. THERE IS NO ANTICIPATED ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT RESULTING FROM THIS INCIDENT. SINCE THE PRODUCT WAS NOT CONTAINED A DOT 5800.1 MUST BE GENERATED. THE QUANTITY OF PRODUCT SPILLED IS BELIEVED TO BE 45-50 GALLONS (POSSIBLY LESS). THE RQ FOR SODIUM HYDROXIDE IS 78.125 GALLONS (AT 12.8 LBS. PER GALLONS). ON 27 JULY 2001, I RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM TONY CHEVONY (CHARTER STEEL). MR. CHEVONY CALLED TO REPORT AN INCIDENT THAT HAD OCCURRED AT THE CHARTER STEEL FACILITY IN RISINGSUN, OH. MR. CHEVONY STATED THAT OUR DRIVER OVERFILLED THEIR HOLDING TANK AND PRODUCT SPILLED OUT (THROUGH THE VENT PIPING ONTO TWO CARS AND ALSO SPLATTERED ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE BUILDING. MR. CHEVONY BELIEVES THAT THIS INCIDENT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DRIVER DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND FAILING TO REPORT THE SPILL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO THE DRIVER. I INQUIRED AS TO HOW CHARTER STEEL DETERMINES THE CAPACITY LEVEL OF THE TANK. HE STATED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW HOW IT IS DETERMINED WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO RE-SUPPLY THE PRODUCT. HE FURTHER STATED THAT THE TOTAL TANK CAPACITY WAS ABOUT 5,000 GALLONS. I WAS GIVEN PERMISSION TO VISIT THE FACILITY THAT AFTERNOON TO GATHER INFORMATION AND SEE THE DAMAGE. ACCORDING TO THE DRIVER, IT WAS ROUTINE DELIVERY AND THAT HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY INCIDENT THAT HAD TAKEN PLACE. I SECURED THE WAYBILL FOR THIS LOAD AND OBSERVED THAT SOMEONE FROM CHARTER STEEL SIGNED THE CERTIFICATION BLOCK. THIS BLOCK STATES, "" I CERTIFY THAT THE TANK TRUCK IS CONNECTED TO THE PROPER PIPING AND STORAGE TANK WHICH IS ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE THE NET WEIGHT OF THE COMMODITY NAMED ON THE BILL OF LADING"". THE SHIPPING PAPER AND WAYBILL INDICATE THAT 3700 GALLONS OF PRODUCT WAS ORDERED. THE WEIGHT SLIP AGREES WITH THE AMOUNT ORDERED. I ARRIVED AT THE FACILITY AT ABOUT 1230 HOURS ON 27 JULY AS PLANNED. JIM STUCK (OPERATIONS SUPERVISOR) MET ME. THE FACILITY IS A MODERN STEEL PICKING PLANT AND APPEARS TO BE TWO OR THREE YEARS OLD. THE SITE HAS A DUEL PURPOSE LOADING/UNLOADING RACK FOR LOAD SPENT PHOSPHORIC ACID AND UNLOADING FRESH PHOSPHORIC ACID, HYDROCHLORIC ACID, AND CAUSTIC SODA. THE TRACTOR/TRAILER IS POSITIONED IN A DIKED CONTAINMENT AREA, WHILE LOADING /UNLOADING PRODUCT. THE CONTAINMENT SYSTEM IS EQUIPPED WITH A DRAIN., WHICH IS CONNECTED TO AN EFFLUENT SYSTEM.
