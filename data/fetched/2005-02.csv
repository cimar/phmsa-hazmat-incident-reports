While offloading at the customer facility in Riverside, California, the hose came loose due to pressure caused by an open valve during transfer, which resulted in the release of approximately 1 quart of free product.  The pressure caused the free product to spray into the eyes and face of two employees, one Slay Transportation Co., Inc. employee, and one customer employee.  Apparently, the product left a burning sensation.  Both employees sought medical attention at JFK Memorial Hospital and were admitted for observation.  The consignee performed the cleanup using an absorbent rag and neutralized the free product.  Spent material was placed along with like waste at the facility, to be held for proper disposal.  No further action is required at this time.  Both employees were released following observation with no additional symptoms.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be related to an open valve during transfer, which results in an over-pressurized hose, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

A response crew was dispatched to the scene within minutes of notification.  Once the spill response crew arrived on-site, a small puncture was found in one poly 55-gallon drum of Fluorosilicic Acid.  The drum was overpacked into a poly 85-gallon salvage drum.  The spill in the trailer, on the asphalt surface of the parking lot, and the floor in the receiving facility was cleaned utilizing speedy dry and lime for neutralization.  The lime was applied multiple times until a neutral pH was obtained in the rinse water.  Seven drums of waste were generated from the cleanup.  The entire cleanup took approximately 6 hours for completion.    See below for picture of punctured drum.","To prevent recurrance of this incident again, we suggest working with our shippers on inspection of pallets prior to loading of drums on them.  This may prevent protruding nails or other objects from impacting the drums and causing spills.    In addition, we will review with our drivers the importance of inspecting a load prior to leaving the shippers location(s).",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7846,Gold Coast Freightways,US,

AES reported that a small amount of product was on gravel and driver placed cardboard under the leak from the trailer. AES opened the trailer (equipped with respirators and PID) since an MSDS could not be provided. Once inside the trailer, AES reported that the drum was in the middle of the trailer. There was no place to unhook the back trailer to offload the leaker. They tried to move to the Flying J Truck Plaza but there was no room. They found a parking lot about a mile up the highway and offloaded the trailer. The drum appeared to be defective. The leak was coming from the bottom rim of the drum and there were no signs of a puncture and no obstructions in the floor of the trailer. The drum was overpacked and absorbent was placed on the floor of the trailer and picked up. The team reloaded the trailer with the overpacked leaking drum and sent the driver on his way.

Driver was going to fast to negotiate turn when tractor and trailer rolled on off-ramp.  The distortion of the trailer allowed hot asphalt to leak out of the loading dome on top of the trailer.  State crews responded and built a dike our of dirt and routed the asphalt into a field off of the side of the off ramp where the product cooled and solidified.  Three days later, clean up crews loaded the material into dump trucks and took the material to a qualified dump site",The driver had driven the same route over the last three days.

Packerland Dr.,Green Bay,WI,54306,Carrier,"Driver picked up a preloaded cargo tank at the shipper.  Because of the company's fall-protection procedures, driver was not allowed to go on top of trailer to check the dome and washout cap to see if they were secure.  Driver mentioned his concern to the guard on his way out and the guard said they used to have a platform at the gate that drivers could use but it was hit by a box trailer and never replaced.  Once driver got out of gate, there were signs posted for no stopping or parking all the way to the interstate.  Driver stopped at nearest safe haven to check top of trailer and found a little product in crash box and it started to run down the drain hose. Back washout cap was cross threaded and some product was on trailer. We called out a response firm, Hulcher, to clean up the spill.  They said they cleaned up about 1/2 gal of product from the asphalt and wiped down trailer.",The issue was discussed with the shipper and hopefully they will get the platform replaced so drivers can do proper pretrips before leaving their yard.

He used the road #165 instead of the highway, because he wanted to stop for something to eat. It was 4:20 a.m. when, acording to the driver, a car coming in the opposite direction invaded his lane. The driver had to manouver to the right to avoid crashing with the vehicle. In doing so the tires went of the shoulder but he was able to take the truck on the road again. Even when he was able to take the truck back on track, themovement and weight of the product in the tank took over the truck and cuased to fall down on its right side. In that moment the truck and tank sled over the raod for aprpximaetly 250 feet and then stopped.     The driver called the Operations Coordinator inmediately, who then contacted the Safety Manager. The emergency response unit from Camioneros was inmediately activated and sent to the accident scene. In the meanwhile the driver and the Operations coordinator began the spill control measures. THe Safety Manager contacted Indutech, a contractor clean up comany, at 4:35 a.m. The Camioneros brugade got to the scene at 5:15 a.m. and began the spill control and the clean-up procedure. The road was closed by teh Police Department at approximately 4:40 a.m. The Fire Department and the Emergency Management Agency where at the site to help mitigate the possibility of a fire or explosion.     The spill source was found to be the air inward vent that when the tank hit the raod broke and let the product out. The source was cloged and the transfer procedure was started inmediately. A 6,000 gallon tank truck and another tractor with a 10,000 gallon tank were brought to make the transfer. The transfer took approximately 5 hours to complete. Once the transfer was done the truck was lifted using two cranes and hauled away to the Camioneros' premises.     Once the tank and truck were taken away the claun up work continued until 3:15 p.m. when the EQB declared the site safe and awarded permission to re-open the road. All the waste generated was punt on a 20 Yard container and tested for disposal al the site, then it was taken to Camioneros to store it until the lab results and the waste manifest are approved for disposal.","Since it was determined that the driver did not follow procedures by not taking the designated route for that trip, a meeting with all drivers was held two days following the accident. During that meeting the drivers were reminded of the approved routes for each trip and were advised that failure to follow these routes would  result in severe sanctions. On the other hand a couple of weeks prior the accident an Accident Policy for Camioneros Cooperativa was developed and published and it will be effective on the 15th of March 2005.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,190400,Camioenros Cooperativa de Transporte de Carga,US,

FORT TRANSFER DRIVER WAS DISPATCHED TO PICK UP A LOAD FOR K.A. STEEL AT THEIR ST. LOUIS AREA LOCATION ON FRIDAY JANUARY, 28, 2005 FOR A DELIVERY ON SATURDAY, JANUARY 29, 2005 IN LOUISVILLE, KY.  THE PRODUCT HAD NOT BEEN LOADED ONTO OUR TRAILER FOR SHIPMENT AND WAS NOT READY FOR TRANSPORT AT THAT TIME.  2.  AN OUTSIDE SERVICE WAS BEING USED BY K.A. STEEL TO EMPTY A TANK OF PRODUCT.  THIS WAS THE FINAL LOAD OF A DILUTED SOLUTION OF PRODUCT.  IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE STORAGE TANK, AND LOADED INTO THEIR UNIT.  FROM THERE IT WAS THEN LOADED INTO THE FORT TRANSFER TRAILER FOR MOVEMENT TO THEIR CUSTOMER.  WHEN THE PRODUCT WAS LOADED INTO THE FORT TRANSFER TRAILER IT WAS PUMPED FROM THEIR UNIT INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE FORT UNIT.  THIS WAS COMPLETE AND THE FORT TRAILER SAT OVER THE WEEKEND.  3.  THE FORT TRANSFER DRIVER RETURNED TO PICK THE LOAD ON MONDAY, JANUARY 31, 2005, AND COMPLETE THE DELIVERY TO ALLIED DRUM IN LOUISVILLE, KY ON TUESDAY FEBRUARY 1, 2005  4.  THE FORT TRANSFER DRIVER ARRIVED AT ALLIED DRUM AROUND NOON ON FEBRUARY, 1, 2005.  HE WAS TOLD THAT THEY DID HAVE ROOM FOR THE PRODUCT AT THAT TIME AND TO DELIVER IT TO A ""SLOP TANK"" ON THE SIDE OF THE FACILITY.  5.  THE FORT DRIVER ARRIVED AT THE DELIVERY POINT AND SET THE TRAILER FOR THE DELIVERY.  THIS INCLUDED ATTACHING THE HOSE CONNECTIONS, SETTING UP PRESSURE IN THE TANK, AND OPENING THE VALVES.  6.  NO PRODUCT CAME OUT.  THE DRIVER RECHECKED ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT ANOTHER TIME TO SEE THAT THE VALVES WERE OPEN, THE HOSES WERE CONNECTED CORRECTLY, AND THAT THERE WAS PRESSURE IN THE TANK, AND OPENING THE VALVES.  6.  NO PRODUCT CAME OUT.  THE DRIVER RECHECKED ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT ANOTHER TIME TO SEE THAT THE VALVES WERE OPEN, THE HOSES WERE CONNECTED CORRECTLY, AND THAT THERE WAS PRESSURE IN THE TANK.  STILL NO PRODUCT CAME OUT.  7.  THE DRIVER RELEASED THE PRESSURE FROM THE TANK, CLOSED THE VALVES, AND REMOVED THE HOSE.  8.  AT THIS POINT THE DRIVER REMOVED THE EXTERNAL VALVE AND DISCOVERED THAT THE PRODUCT WAS FROZEN IN THE 4 INCH DIAMETER LINE THAT RUNS ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE TRAILER FROM THE EXTERNAL VALVE TO THE INTERNAL VALVE.  9.  THE DRIVER THEN TRIED TO CLEAR THE FROZEN LINE WITH WATER AND AN OLD BROOM HANDLE.  HE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AT CLEARING THE PLUGGED LINE IN THIS MANNER.  HE ASKED THE PEOPLE ASSISTING HIM IF THEY HAD A STEAM LINE AVAILABLE.  THEY INDICATED THAT THEY DID, BUT THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO MOVE THE UNIT TO REACH IT.  HE THEN MOVED THE UNIT 300 FEET FORWARD TO THE REACH THE STEAM LINE.  HE USED THE STEAM LINE TO MELT THE ICE AND CLEAR THE LINE.  HE SAID THAT IT WORKED WELL, AND THAT HE WAS STARTING TO REPLACE THE EXTERNAL VALVE AND CLAMP WHEN PRODUCT BEGAN TO FLOW OUT.  12.  THE DRIVER AGAIN CHECKED THE HYDRAULIC KNOB, TURNING IT BACK AND FORTH.  HE RAN TO THE FRONT OF THE UNIT AND HIT THE EMERGENCY SHUT OFF.  PRODUCT STILL WAS COMING OUT OF THE TRAILER.  DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT AND HEAVY FLOW, IT WAS NOT ADVISABLE TO ATTEMPT TO REPLACE THE EXTERNAL VALVE.  PERSON","1.  WHEN THE TRAILER WAS RETURNED THE VALVE SYSTEM WAS CHECKED.  IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE INTERNAL VALVE HAD FOREIGN MATERIAL LODGED IN IT.  IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE MATERIAL CAME FROM INSIDE OF THE BULK STORAGE TANK THAT WAS BEING EMPTIED.  THUS THE VALVE WAS KEPT IN THE OPEN POSITION AND UNABLE TO BE CLOSED.  I AM TOLD THAT THE PRODUCT HAS A FREEZING POINT OF AROUND 50 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.  SINCE THE PRODUCT HAD BEEN FORCED INTO THE TRAILER FROM THE BOTTOM RATHER THAN LOADING FROM THE DOME LID IT MAKES SENSE THAT ANY PRODUCT REMAINING IN THE BOTTOM LINE WOULD HAVE FROZEN.  THE DRIVER ATTEMPTING TO UNLOAD WOULD THEN HAVE HAD TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE LINE IN ORDER TO OPEN IT SO THE DELIVERY COULD BE COMPLETED.  2.  THE DRIVER MADE AN ASSUMPTION, BASED ON WHAT HE FELT HAD OCCURRED WHEN HE USED THE ALL OF THE CORRECT CONTROLS, THAT THE INTERNAL VALVE IN THE TRAILER WAS CLOSED.  WITH THIS ASSUMPTION HE THEN REMOVED THE EXTERNAL VALVE IN AN ATTEMPT TO SEE WHAT WAS CAUSING THE BLOCKAGE IN THE LINE.  THAT IS WHERE THE DRIVER MADE HIS MISTAKE.  AFTER HAVING REMOVED THE EXTERNAL VALVE AND DISCOVERING THE LINE TO BE FROZEN, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED AGAIN BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO CLEAR THE LINE.  BOTH THE DRIVER AND THE PEOPLE ASSISTING HIM WHEN HE ASKED ABOUT A STEAM LINE MISSED THIS STEP.  AGAIN, THROUGH BOTH ASSUMED THAT THE INTERNAL VALVE WAS CLOSED AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  3.  IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS IF A LINE IS DISCOVERED TO BE BLOCKED BY FROZEN PRODUCT, THE VALVES SHOULD BE LEFT IN PLACE, AND HEAT APPLIED TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE LINE IN ORDER TO MELT THE FROZEN PRODUCT.  BUT, PRIOR TO APPLYING THE HEAT, THE DRIVER NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT IN THE LINE, TO BE SURE IT WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE REACTION TO THE APPLICAITON OF HEAT!  A BUCKET OR RECEPTACLE CAN BE PLACED AT THE END OF THE LINE AND THE EXTERNAL VALVE CRACKED OPEN TO ALLOW THE PRODUCT TO COME OUT AND NOT BUILD UP PRESSURE AS MELTING OCCURS.  THE PRODUCT CAUGHT IN THE BUCKET CAN THEN BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER FOR THEIR DISPOSAL OR PROCESSING THE SAME AS FOR NORMAL PRODUCT LEFT IN THE LINE OR HOSES THAT ARE EMPTIED AT THE END OF A DELIVERY.  4.  A REVIEW OF THIS PROCESS WILL BE PASSED ON TO ALL OUR DRIVERS SO THEY WILL BE KNOWLEDGEABLE OF ""WHAT TO DO"" IN ANY SIMILAR BLOCKED LINE SITUATIONS.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,122,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,0,,,

During offload, the driver went in to check on the tank but failed to shut down while he was away from the trailer.  While he was inside checking on the tank, a hose used for the offload had separated from its fitting.  The fitting was still attached to the pump outlet.  Driver shut down by using the emergency shutoff. The spill was contained in a concrete area with a small wall around it on 3 sides and a building on the other side.  HMHTTC was called out to clean up the spill.  Clean-up is still ongoing because the product that was hot, became very gummy and difficult to clean once it cooled off.

The Brownville Fire Department was notified immediately and given information relative to current Haz-Mat cars in the yard, location and emergency response information on the possible suspected problem molten sulfur cars.    MMA Manager Locomotive Operations, arrived about 1910, inspected two molten sulphur cars currently in the yard and discovered that TILX 135352 was emitting a strong sulphur smell (rotten Eggs). Inspection of the car found no evidence of leaking product and no cloud as previously reported. The weather was clear, with a very slight North West wind. The temperature was approximately 5 degrees.    The Brownville Fire Department arrived about 1910 and re-inspected the car and reviewed the hazards presented by the sulphur smell. The car moved to a remote location at the West end of Brownville Jct away from the residential area.  It was suspected that the rupture disc was bad and allowing some gases to escape.     On Febuary 4, 2005 the rupture disk was replaced by MMA Mechanical Forces, however the original one was inspected and found to be in good order.  Further inspection by MMA Mechanical and Transportation Supervisors noted that there was a hole rusted in the dome (not the tank) in the area of the dome lid hinge.      On February 8, 2005 the car was re-inspected by a Transportation Supervisor and no fumes were detected around or in the vicinity of the car.  Chemtrade was notified about the possible corrosive problem in the hinge area of the dome.  They advised that when the car was emptied it would be inspected and repaired.",The shipper should have made closer inspection of the dome area and addressed any serious corrosion problems before the car was released for shipment to the rail carrier.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway",US,

The cylinder was located at a residence in a trailer court. He drove away without disconnecting the hose on the bulk truck from the cylinder. Our investigation reveals that there was a release of  propane from the 200# cylinder because the filler valve on the Sherwood 2030C multivalve on the cylinder, failed to sheer away and initiate a backcheck valve closure, as required under UL 125.  Instead, the filler valve did not sheer but separated from the multivalve and destroyed the backcheck valve when the filler valve broke apart where it threaded to the multivalve. The propane caught fire and burned the trailer. The hose from the bulk truck leaked less than a gallon of propane. The ignition source is undetermined.","Employees are coached to follow our policies of ignition key control and performing a complete walk-around of the vehicle before moving it. Employees who fail to follow our policies are often times required to write and present a safety meeting to their piers covering the infraction they committed.

Luard, was contacted to inspect the container. The container was found to have one leaking drum near the front of the container. A hazmat team from Clean Harbors was then contacted to remove, clean and repack the leaking drum and transfer the rest of the drums to a different ocean container. The original ocean container was then cleaned by the hazmat team.   The drum was leaking from the very bottom, along the seam. The hole was very small and it was very difficult to determine whether the liner in the drum failed or whether the drum was damaged during loading.","The investigation has been started and will be completed once the product arrives at the final destination.

The engine brakes were on.  I was traveling 20 miles an hour, but no more than 25 miles an hour.  When I applied the brakes again I was touching the deck.  I couldn't stop the truck anywhere, because of the homes and there was no space and all other options were too dangerous to pull over and stop.  i shifted down from 4th to 3rd gear.  I felt the weight of the load pushing the truck down.  When I was 3rd gear, I heard a snap.  it sounded like the brake springs were snapping.  Pretty much at the corner at the bottom of the hill, I heard the same snapping sound, then the brakes failed.  My air pressure was still at 75-80, then the engine brake shut down and then I applied the brakes but could not slow down the truck.  Pijfroac hod the corner, trying to control tilE truck b swerving on Ito the oncoming lane to be abbi to make the approaching turn and hoping to have a direct approach into the village of timatac The truck rolled over on its passenger sIde and skidded on its side into the power pole, I landed on the passenger side, I blacked out for a few seconds and when I regained consciousness and I suddenly saw and felt heat and a gush of diesel fuel bit m in the face and body I pushed backwards and rolled out of the truck through the buste ci windshield When I got out of the truck, the truck was still running but was surrounded by flames  I ran down the hill looking",,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,0,AMBYTH TRUCKING,US,
