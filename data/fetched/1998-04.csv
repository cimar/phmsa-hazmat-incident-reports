BY 0830, CHEMTREC WAS CALLED, THE DECK HAD BEEN CLEARED OF ALL PERSONNEL, THE PORT AND STBD WATERTIGHT DOORS HAD BEEN SHUT, AND THE SIGNS WENT UP TELLING ALL CREW MEMBERS OF THE DANGERS ON THE DECK.  THE CHIEF ENGINEER WAS ALSO AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WAS MONITORING A WALKIE-TALKIE, AS WAS THE CAPTAIN, BOSUN, BRIDGE, AND CHIEF MATE.  ALSO, VENTS ON DECK WERE SHUT AND SEALED.  CHEMTREC WAS INFORMED OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED, THEY WERE ABLE TO REACH TOM LORD, AND SEVERAL OTHERS.  THE ADDRESS WAS GIVEN BY THE SHIP OF VARIOUS NAMES, PHONE NUMBERS AND ADDRESSES THAT APPEARED ON THE SHIPPING PAPERS.  THE ADDRESSES OF THE FOLLOWING WERE GIVEN:  SKYHAWK CHEMICAL- THE CONSIGNEE, 7887 KATY FRWY SUITE 350, HOUSTON, TX 77024; DANA CONTAINER - SHIPPER/EXPORTER, 210 ESSEX AVE, AVENEL, NJ 07001; CONTINENTAL NITROGEN & RESOURCES CORP - MANUFACTURER, 12955 COURTHOUSE BLVD, ROSEMOUNT, MN 55068.  THE THREE TO FOUR WAY CONFERENCE CALL WENT ON UNTIL 1030 (APPROXIMATELY).  AT THAT TIME ALL PARTIES CONCERNED WERE WAITING FOR THE SHIP TO BE FAXED THE DIAGRAMS FOR THE LEAKY TANK, AND FOR TIME FOR THE SHIP TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST PLAN OF ACTION.  1040 - WALLY BECKER HAD BEEN CALLED, VIA T. LORD'S OFFICE, AND HE CALLED THE SHIP.  HE WAS BRIEFED, AND THEN THE SHIP WAITED FOR THE FAXES TO COME IN.  BY 1250 -  ALL FAXES WERE IN, GIVING THE DETAILS OF THE VALVES AND THEIR LOCATIONS. A BRIEFING WAS HELD, THE PROPER APPROACH, THE TYPE OF APPROACH, AND NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS TAKEN. I.E., SIGNALS TO BE USED FOR THE SAFETY LINES. BY 1420, THE CHIEF WAS SUITED UP AND READY, HE, ALONG WITH THE 2ND MATE, AND WITH A 3RD PERSON IN STANDY, WERE ALL SUITED UP, WITH CHEMICAL SUITS, SCBA'S, AND SAFETY LINES.  THEY THEN WENT TO THE TANK.  WHILE THIS WAS BEING DONE, THE DECK DEPT WAS ASSISTING IN THE OPERATION.  THE ENGINE ROOM WAS READY FOR WHATEVER WAS TO HAPPEN.  THE 1ST ENGINEER WAS ON DECK WITH A WALKIE-TALKIE, READY TO GO TO THE ENGINE ROOM CONSOLE.  THE SHUTTING DOWN OF THE VALVE, OR THE PERFECT ASSESSMENT OF THE EXACT PROBLEM WAS NOT DONE.  THE CHIEF WAS UNABLE TO SEE IF IT EVEN WAS A VALVE, OR GAUGE PROBLEM, DUE TO THE GASEOUS CLOUDY DISCHARGE OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA, HIS VISION WAS TOO OBSCURED.  AT 1500, TOM LORD WAS CALLED, WALLY BECKER WAS BROUGHT IN ON THE CALL, AND A DEBRIEFING WAS HELD.  THE CHIEF SUMMIZED, THAT HE WAS NO ABLE TO STOP ANY LEAK, HOWEVER, THE PRESSURE WILL BE LESS WHEN WE GET TO SJU. THEREFORE MAKING THE SHUTDOWN OR ASSESSMENT A LOT EASIER AND LESS DANGEROUS.

WAS PROCEEDING ON COUNTY ROAD G-13 NEAR NORTH ENGLISH, IOWA. THERE WERE TWO 110 GALLON MINI BULK CONTAINERS OF TENKOZ LV-4 2, 4-D ESTER ON THE TRAILER AT THE VERY REAR OF THE TRAILER. THE TRACTOR TRAILER PASSED OVER  A SECTION OF THE ROAD THAT HAD BEEN PUSHED UP BY FROST IN THE GROUND. THE SHOCK OF THIS BUMP IN THE ROAD WAS ALL TRANSMITTED TO THE CARGO THROUGH THE SUSPENSION OF THE TRAILER. THIS SHOCK RUPTURED BOTH MINI-BULK TANKS. THE DRIVER DID NOT NOTICE THE PRODUCT RUNNING ON THE ROADWAY IMMEDIATELY AS IT WAS RAINING. THE PRODUCT EMPTIED ONTO THE ROADWAY FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 MILES BEFORE THE TRUCK WAS STOPPED. IMMEDIATELY UPON DISCOVERING THE PROBLEM , OUR DRIVER USED A PHONE OF A PASSERBY TO CONTACT THE LOCAL COUNTY THROUGH THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. THE DRIVER THEN CONTACTED OUR WAREHOUSE MANAGER, CHRIS JOHNSON, AND HE IMMEDIATELY WENT TO THE SITE WITH RECOVERY ITEMS AND ASSISTANCE. THE FIRST RESPONDER TO THE SCENE WAS LARRY SMITH, THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COORDINATOR FOR KEOKUK COUNTY. HE CONTACTED THE LOCAL VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT WHO BLOCKED OFF FIVE MILES OF THE COUNTY ROAD. MR. SMITH THEN CONTACTED THE KEOKUK COUNTY HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT WHO PUT DOWN SAND ALONG THE ROAD WHERE THE PRODUCT HAD SPILLED. THE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT AND FIREMEN ALSO ASSISTED IN THE CLEAN UP OF THE SPILL WHERE THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER STOPPED. THE SAWDUST AND OTHER MATERIAL USED TO SOAK UP THE CHEMICAL WERE PUT IN RECOVERY DRUMS. THE DIRT THAT WAS RECOVERED FROM THE ROAD SIDE SPILL, WHERE THE TRUCK STOPPED, WAS LOADED INTO THE BACK OF THE ROSEN TRAILER. TOM SEVER OF THE IOWA DOT THEN DIRECTED THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER TO BE PLACED OVER A CONTAINMENT PAD AT NORTH ENGLISH UNTIL THE WHOLE UNIT COULD BE INSPECTED BY THE IOWA DOT IN THE MORNING. ON APRIL 9, 1998 DAVID DRUMMOND OF THE STATE OF IOWA INSPECTED THE TRACTOR TRAILER AND FOUND NO DEFICIENCY IN THE EQUIPMENT AND RELEASED THE EQUIPMENT TO ROSEN'S. MR. DRUMMOND CITED ROSEN'S FOR TWO VIOLATIONS. THE FIRST ON TICKET NO. TO1CG82 FOR ""PACKAGE LEAKING WHILE IN TRANSPORTATION"" AND THE SECOND TICKET NO. TO1CG81 FOR ""INADEQUATE LOAD SECUREMENT"". ROSEN'S HAS PLEAD GUILTY TO EACH OF THESE VIOLATIONS AND HAS FORWARDED A CHECK FOR THE ASSESSED FINES.SINCE THE INCIDENT, ROSEN'S HAS TAKEN THE FOLLOWING MEASURES TO ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE A REPEAT OF THIS INCIDENT. WE HAVE DIRECTED ALL WAREHOUSES TO REFRAIN FROM LOADING MINI-BULK TANKS BEFORE FILING. IF THEY DISCOVER ANYTHING THAT WOULD QUESTION THE INTEGRITY OF THE TANK, WE WON'T PUT PRODUCT IN THE TANK. WE HAVE PURCHASED ADEQUATE LOAD LOCKS AND STRAPS WITH RATCHET TIGHTENERS TO SECURE ALL MINI-BULK TANKS FROM THE TOP. WE HAD SECURED THEM FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND FRONT TO BACK IN THE PAST. WE RECENTLY ORDERED TWO NEW TANDEM STRAIGHT TRUCKS FROM NAVISTAR WITH AIR-RIDE SUSPENSION. MOST OF OUR RECENT STRAIGHT TRUCK AND TRAILER PURCHASES HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH AIR-RIDE.

THE MATERIAL WILL BE SHIPPED OFF  SITE WITHIN 90 DAYS. AT ABOUT 9:15 P.M. ON THURSDAY APRIL 30, 1998 EMPLOYEE'S WORKING IN THE AREA OF ENVIRONMENTAL SUMP  SAW WHAT APPEARED TO AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF STEAM VAPOR SURROUNDING THE PAA CAR WHICH WAS BEING MELTED.  THEY CALLED THE RAW MATERIAL UNLOADING OPERATOR WHO WAS CONNECTING ANOTHER CAR FOR UNLOADING TO COME OVER TO THE CAR TO INVESTIGATE.  AS HE APPROACHED THE CAR HE NOTICED MOLTEN PAA JUST BEGINNING TO FLOW DOWN THE SIDE OF THE CAR.  THE LEAK APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE AREA  AT TOP OF THE RAIL CAR.  THE EMPLOYEE IMMEDIATELY SHUT OFF THE STEAM, DISCONTINUED UNLOADING THE CAR AND CLOSED THE AUTOMATIC VALVE FROM THE RAIL CONTAINMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUMP.  WHEN THE STEAM WAS SHUT OFF AND THE UNLOADING PROCESS HALTED THE FLOW OF PAA DECREASED AND THEN CEASED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, DAVID JACK,PAUL RIDGELY, BILL TORRENCE, AND TOM MADDEN WERE CONTACTED AND THEY ALL CAME TO THE TRACK.  THEY DETERMINED THAT THE ACTION ALREADY TAKEN HAD MITIGATED THE RELEASE AND THAT NO FURTHER ACTION WAS NECESSARY TO STOP  THE RELEASE OF MATERIAL FORM THE CAR.  AS SOON AS THE STEAM DISSIPATED FROM AROUND THE CAR THE OPERATOR, BILL TORRENCE AND TOM MADDEN WENT UP ON TOP OF THE CAR.  FROM VISUAL OBSERVATION IT APPEARED THE GASKET BETWEEN THE UNLOADING FLANGE ON TOP OF THE CAR AND BOTTOM OF THE CAR UNLOADING VALVE HAD ""BLOWN OUT"".  THIS WAS ALLOWING PAA TO ESCAPE FROM BETWEEN THE FLANGE FACES.  THE AREA THAT HAD FAILED WAS BOUT A 20 DEGREES RADIUS.  THIS VALVE AND GASKET ARE PART OF THE CAR STRUCTURE AND ARE NOT PART OF THE UNLOADING PROCESS THAT THE PLANT OPERATOR PUTS ON OR REMOVES DURING THE UNLOADING PROCESS. JIM FREEMAN WAS IN THE PLANT ATTENDING A TRUCKING MEETING.  WE INFORMED HIM OF THE INCIDENT AND HE SAID THAT HE DID NOT THINK THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST INCIDENT REGARDING LEAKING GASKETS ON THE NEW REICHHOLD CARS.  WE ASKED JIM WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE RAIL CAR PROGRAM AND HE ADVISED THAT THE PRIMARY CONTACT WAS TOM GRUWELL. WE CONTACTED TOM AND OTHERS IN RTP AND REQUESTED PERMISSION TO REPLACE THE GASKET ON CAR #TIMX-20439.  HE SAID THAT WE COULD PROCEED AD WE DID AT ONCE.  THE GASKET REMOVED FROM THE CAR REVILED THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN INSTALLED PROPERLY.  ON AN APPROXIMATELY 30 DEGREES ARC THE INSIDE OF THE GASKET WAS NOT IN CONTACT WITH ONE SURFACE OF THE FLANGE FACE. THIS ALLOWED MATERIAL TO ESCAPE. WE COLLECTED AND WEIGHED ALL THE PAA THAT HAD FLOWED DOWN THE SIDE OF THE CAR AND WHICH HAD COLLECTED IN THE RAIL SIDING CONTAINMENT AREA.
