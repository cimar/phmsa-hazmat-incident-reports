GENERAL MATERIALS WAS UNABLE TO LIFT CONTAINER MHFU 001003 DUE TO THE CONFIGURATION OF THEIR NEWLY OBTAINED SPREADER DEVICE.  THE OPERATOR DECIDED TO WAIT AND LOAD MHFU 001003 LAST UTILIZING ALTERNATE AUTHORIZED RIGGING METHODS. MHFU 003001 WAS BLOCKING THE OTHER CONTAINERS TO BE LOADED AND WAS ATTEMPTED TO ""SHOVED"" OUT THE WAY UTILIZING A BUCKET LOADER.  THE OPERATOR DAMAGED MHFU 003001 IN ATTEMPTING TO MOVE THE CONTAINER BY THE CORNER WITH THE BUCKET LOADER.  GENERAL MATERIALS IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED MHF-LS VIA TELEPHONE THAT THEY HAD DAMAGED A CONTAINER. GENERAL MATERIALS REPORTED A 6-8 INCH GOUGE WAS PUT INTO THE CONTAINER BY THE CORNER OF THE BUCKET.  GENERAL MATERIALS STOP MOVEMENT OF THE CONTAINER, ROPED OFF THE AREA AROUND THE CONTAINER, AND WITNESSED NO MATERIAL WAS COMING FROM THE GOUGE.  MHF-LS INSTRUCTED GENERAL MATERIALS TO STOP LOADING AND TO WAIT UNTIL REPRESENTATIVES FROM MHF-LS AND B&W COULD SURVEY THE INCIDENT.  b&W HEALTH PHYSICS PERSONNEL AT THE INCIDENT SURVEY THE GOUGE AND THE BUCKET AND DETERMINED THAT THE CONTAINER HAD BEEN DAMAGED.  A DECISION WAS MADE TO PATCH THE GOUGE WITH DEVCON SEALANT AND A PLATE OF METAL UTILIZING SELF-TAPPING SCREWS AND PAINT THE REPAIRED AREA. THE AREA WAS RESURVEY BY B&W PERSONNEL WHICH RESULT IN NEGATIVE RESULTS.  IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  PERSONNEL OF GENERAL MATERIALS STOP OPERATIONS AND ROPED OFF AREA.  QUALIFIED B&W PERSONNEL SURVEYED THE AREA.  A ""STRONG-TIGHT"" PATCH WAS APPLIED TO ALLOW CONTAINER TO BE SHIPPED.  ROOT CAUSE:  THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF ATTEMPTING TO RELOCATE A CONTAINER WITH A FRONT END BUCKET LOADER.  A GENERAL MATERIALS OPERATOR ATTEMPTED TO POSITION THE CONTAINER BY APPLYING THE BUCKET OF THE LOADER AGAINST THE CONER POST OF THE CONTAINER AND FORCE THE CONTAINER FORWARD.  THE BUCKET SLIPPED OFF THE CORNER POST AND IMPELLED THE FRONT OF THE LOWER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF THE CONTAINER CREATING A 6 TO 8 INCH GOUGE INTO THE CONTAINER.  THE ROOT CAUSE IS OPERATOR ERROR, WHICH LED TO IMPROPER SELECTION OF EQUIPMENT TO RELOCATE THE CONTAINER.  ACTIONS TO PREVENT RECURRENCE:  ON 5/25/99 MHF-LS PERSONNEL INTERVIEWED AND REVIEWED THE INCIDENT WITH GENERAL MATERIALS PERSONNEL.  ON 5/25/99 A POLICY LETTER WAS PRESENT TO GENERAL MATERIALS PERSONNEL ON HANDLING COMMUNICATED TO GENERAL MATERIALS BY MHF-LS.

MANAGER COOPER CONTACTED DENNIS JOHNSON MANAGER CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAGETY TUCSON ARIZONA AND WAS ADVISED THE ABOVE TANK CAR WAS IN THE COLTON RECEIVING YARD AND FOUND LEAKING FROM THE TOP PORTION OF THE CAR.  THE CAR WAS OBSERVED LEAKING BY MECHANICAL DEPT FORCES WHILE PERFORMING NORMAL CAR INSPECTIONS.  SINCE THE TANK CAR WAS BURIED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RECEIVING YARD TRACK #205, ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH THE YARDMASTER TO SEPARATE RECEIVING YARD TRACK #206 IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE AREA.  MANAGER COOPER ARRIVED ON SCENE AND MET WITH SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT BATTALION CHIEF SCHROEDER, SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT HAZMAT SPECIALIST SNIDER AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT HAZARDOUS MATERIAL DIVISION SPECIALIST BECKHAM/ MITCH DUGGER, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEER WAS ALSO ON SCENE TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE.  ONCE THE 206 TRACK WAS CLEARED FOR OBSERVATION IT WAS NOTED THE TANK CAR HAD A PRODUCT TRAIL DOWN THE SIDE OF THE CAR AND LIQUID WAS STEADILY DRIPPING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK CAR.  A CLOSER INSPECTION NOTED THE PRODUCT BEING EMITTED FROM THE PROTECTIVE COVER THAT HOUSES THE LIQUID AND AIR VALVES.  THE TANK WAS ALSO INSPECTED FOR TEMPERATURE LEVELS AT ALL FOUR OF THE BOULSTER OPENINGS IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE IF THE PRODUCT WAS HEATING UP.  THE DRIPPING LIQUID WAS ALSO MONITORED FOR TEMPERATURE LEVELS AND FOUND TO BE WITHIN NORMAL RANGE. AFTER THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT WAS MADE, A 3 MAN TEAM C ONSISTING OF MANAGER COOPER SPECIALIST SNIDER AND SPECIALIST BECKHAM RE-ENTERED THE AREA AND CLIMBED THE TANK CAR.  UPON OPENING THE PROTECTIVE VALVE COVER A CLEAR PRODUCT TRAIL WAS NOTED COMING FROM THE LIQUID LINE VALVE.  THE LIQUID LINE BALL VALVE WAS IN THE CLOSED POSITION AND THE PIPE PLUG WAS TIGHT, HOWEVER, PRODUCT WAS STILL BEING EMITTED FROM THE LIQUID LINE.  THE AIR LINE PIPE PLUG WAS REMOVED AND THE BALL VALVE CRACKED IN ORDER TO RELIEVE THE INTERNAL PRESSURE OF THE TANK CAR.  THE AIR LINE VENTED FOR 3-4 MINUTES BEFORE THE PRESURE BECAME NEUTRAL, INDICATING THE CAR HAD LESS THAT 5 PSI.  ONCE THE PRESSURE WAS RELIEVED IN THE TANK CAR THE PRODUCT CEASED DISCHARGING THROUGH THE LIQUID LINE.  THE LIQUID LINE PIPE PLUG WAS REMOVED AND THE BALL VALVE INSPECTED.  THE BALL VALVE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DAMAGED, AND IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THE BALL WAS SCARRED OR THE SEAT WAS DEFECTIVE.  THE PIPE PLUG WAS NOTED TO HAVE SEVERAL GOUGES AT THE THREADS AND SINCE THE PLUG HAD NO TAPE ON THE THREADS, ONCE THE PRODUCT BY PASSED THE BALL VALVE, IT WAS ALSO ABLE TO BYPASS THE PLUG, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TIGHT.  TEFLON TAPE WAS APPLIED TO THE PIPE PLUG AND THE PLUG WAS PLACED BACK ONTO THE LIQUID LINE.

THIS WAS DONE UNTIL THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE TANK (850 GALLONS) HAD DISPERSED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.
