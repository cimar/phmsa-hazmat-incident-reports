THE MIDWEST ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSPORT DRIVER CHECKED THE DUMP TRAILER AT ANNA OHIO FOR LEAKAGE.  THIS WAS AT MILE MARKER 100 AT INTERSTATE 75 NORTH. THERE WAS NO LEAKAGE AT THIS POINT.  SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE MILE MAKER 100 AND MILE MARKER 189, A INTERSTATE 75 COMMUTER'S CAR CONTACTED SOME LIQUID FROM THE DUMP TRAILER.  THE COMMUTER CONTACTED THE OHIO STATE PATROL.  THE OHIO STATE PATROLMEN PULLED THE DUMP TRAILER OVER AT MILE MARKER 189 ON INTERSTATE 75.  THE DUMP TRAILER WAS LEAKING AT THIS POINT AND HAD DRIPPED A SMALL AMOUNT OF LIQUID ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WHEN STOPPED.  THE HIGHWAY PATROLMAN ASKED FOR THE MANIFEST AND THEN PROCEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BOTH LANES OF INTERSTATE 75.  WITHIN 30 MINUTES A WOOD COUNTY EPA OFFICIAL ARRIVED AT THE SCENE.  THE EPA OFFICIAL ADVISED THE STATE PATROLMEN TO RE-OPEN INTERSTATE 75 WHICH THE PATROLMAN DID.  THIS WAS DUE TO THE SMALL AMOUNT OF MATERIAL THAT ACTUALLY LEAKED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND BENIGN NATURE OF THE LEAKED MATERIAL.  CONCURRENTLY THE DRIVER HAD CONTACTED THE TREATMENT, STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITY WHERE THE MATERIAL HAD BEEN GENERATED.  THE PLANT MANAGER PROCEEDED TO NOTIFY THE OHIO EPA EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER, NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND WOOD COUNTY LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANNING COUNCIL OF THE SITUATION.  EQ WAS CONTRACTED TO MITIGATE THE LEAK AND PERFORM ANY NECESSARY CLEAN UP.  AT MILE MARKER 189, A EQ EMPLOYEE ARRIVED TO MITIGATE THE LEAK FROM THE DUMP TRAILER.  THE BACK OF THE DUMP TRAILER WAS MIXED WITH OIL DRY AND ABSORBENT PADS.  THE DRIVER WAS THEN ADVISED TO MAKE A U TURN AT EXIT 192 AND THEN PROCEED SOUTH ON INTERSTATE 75 BACK TO THE EQ SATELLITE STATION AT EXIT 187.  WHILE IN TRANSIT, AND AFTER STARTING SOUTH ON INTERSTATE 75, THE TRAILER BEGAN TO LEAK AGAIN AT MILE MARKER 191 ON INTERSTATE 75 SOUTH.  BY THAT TIME A CONTRACTED HAZMAT TEAM HAD ARRIVED FROM EQ'S BELLEVILLE MICHIGAN FACILITY.  THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR OF THE GATE WAS SEALED WITH FOAM AND THE LEAK STOPPED.  THE DUMP TRAILER PROCEEDED TO THE EQ SATELLITE STATION AT EXIT 187 ON INTERSTATE 75 SOUTH.  A DOT OFFICIAL HAD ARRIVED AT THIS POINT AND CLEARED THE DUMP TRAILER TO PROCEED TO ITS DISPOSAL POINT AT BELLEVILLE MICHIGAN.  THE DRIVER ARRIVED AT BELLEVILLE MICHIGAN AND SPENT THE NIGHT.

THE ROUTING INDICATED THE CARS SHIPPED FROM OLIN'S NIAGARA FALLS, NY PLANT WERE SWITCHED AT CSXT'S RAIL YARDS IN NIAGARA FALLS, NY, SELKIRK, NY, RICHMOND, VA, AND BELLWOOD, VA FOR DELIVERY TO DUPONT AT AMPTHILL.
