I CONTACTED MECHANIC ASSISTANT JOSH HOLMES AND ADVISED HIM TO RESPOND ALSO. WE ARRIVED AT THE SHOP AT ABOUT 1800 HOURS AND IMMEDIATELY DEPARTED FOR THE SCENE.  WE ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 1910 HOURS.  DRIVER KENNY BURNETTE WAS ON THE SCENE WITH TRACTOR #337 AND TRAILER #32B.  I NOTED A TRAIL OF LIQUID RUNNING FROM THE TRAVELED ROAD SURFACE ONTO THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND LEADING UP TO THE REAR OF THE TRUCK.  ARKANSAS STATE POLICE, PRAIRIE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND HAZEN FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL WERE ALSO ON SCENE.  THEY ESTABLISHED TRAFFIC CONTROL AND SECURED THE SCENE.  THE OUTSIDE LANE OF I-40 WESTBOUND WAS BLOCKED OFF.  TRAFFIC CONTINUED TO FLOW IN THE INSIDE LANE.  TONY CARROLL, JOSH HOLMES AND I USED ONE OF OUR SPILL KITS TO CONTAIN THE POOL AS WELL AS WE COULD.  WE USED THE ABSORBENT PADS AND ""SNAKES"" FOR THAT PURPOSE.  I DIAGRAMED THE SCENE AND NOTED THAT THE NOTICEABLE TRAIL STARTED AT THE RIGHT EDGE OF THE TRAVELED ROAD SURFACE AND CONTINUED FOR 1022' AND ENDED AT THE REAR OF THE TRAILER. THE TRAILER WAS CENTERED ON THE RIGHT SHOULDER.  A TRAIL OF LIQUID WAS OBSERVED COMING FROM THE REAR DOOR AREA OF THE TRUCK AND WAS ALSO LEAKING FROM THE RIGHT SIDE WALL OF THE TRUCK.  THERE WAS A POOL OF LIQUID UNDER THE REAR DUALS OF THE TRAILER.  THE ENTIRE AREA FROM THE REAR OF THE TRAILER FORWARD FOR APPROXIMATELY 21' WAS LIQUID SOAKED AND RAN OFF TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER.  THE RIGHT SHOULD WAS SLOPED AT ABOUT A 25 DEGREE ANGLE AND THE FLUID TRAIL APPEARED TO FLOW STRAIGHT DOWNWARD IN A 21' WIDE PATH (SEE DIAGRAM).  THE FLUID FLOW CONTINUED TO THE TREE LINE AND INTO THE TREES WHERE IT FINALLY STOPPED AND POOLED IN A DRY CREEK BED.  THE FINAL POOL WA ABOUT 14' LONG BY 3' WIDE.  THE TOTAL AREA AFFECTED IS APPROXIMATELY 880 SQUARE FEET.  I OBSERVED THE TRAILER INTERIOR AND NOTED THE FOLLOWING: THE LEAKING CONTAINER WAS A STANDARD SIZE CONTAINER, (APP. 4'X4'X4') SITTING ON A STANDARD SHIPPING PALLET.  THE AFFECTED CONTAINER WAS SITTING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRAILER AND WAS THE LAST UNIT AT THE REAR OF THE LOAD.  THERE WAS ALSO AN IDENTICAL CONTAINER ON THE RIGHT SIDE AT THE REAR OF THE LOAD. NEITHER CONTAINER PALLET APPEARED TO HAVE MOVE.  A STANDARD DRUM DOLLY WAS LOCATED AT THE RIGHT REAR OF THE TRAILER NEXT TO THE DOOR AND WAS PLACED ON THE FLOOR WITH THE WHEEL SIDE UP.  THE LEAKING CONTAINER ITSELF APPEARED TO BE NYLON OR TEFLON AND WAS COVERED BY METALLIC SHELL.  THERE IS A RECESSED OPENING AT THE BOTTOM CENTER OF THE TANK FOR A DRAIN VALVE.  TO THE RIGHT OF THE VALVE (AS YOU LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE TANK), I SAW A LARGE CRACK IN THE CONTAINER WALL.  THE CRACK APPEARED TO BE 4 TO 6 INCHES LONG AS WAS ACTIVELY SEEPING A THICK, SYRUPY FLUID AS I WATCHED.
