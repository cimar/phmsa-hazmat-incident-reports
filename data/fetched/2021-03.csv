While conducting re-railing operations, and performing inspections of derailed tank cars.   UTLX939654, a residue Methyl Mercaptan tank car was discovered to have an opened tattle tell  valve on the Pressure Relief Device.  This was discovered using air monitoring equipment that  detected H2S inside of the protective housing.  The valve was closed and the release was stopped.  ChemTrec was notified and CSX requested a call back from the shipper.  No state or federal  notifications required because release was less than the reportable required quantities.  Release  was limited to less than 1 gallon.  Cythnia Llames with Evonik Corporation (251-443-4000) was  notified.

He contacted me about 1030 to tell me that it is not a major leak, but a drip and the car was the seventh car from the Locomotive. He also stated it was an 1170 Haz-Mat. Flammable Liquid. Gary contacted Lori Zeka in Customer Service to get the waybill and told us the car was going to Meiers Winery in Blue Ash.  Scott Wentz and I left the shop to the location of the car when I called Brian Myers, John Keffer and the Car Shop(James Daley and Kash Helton). Scott and I looked at the ERG to find out what liquid we are now dealing with. The liquid was ethanol.  I instructed James and Kash to get their spill tub and Blue Flags and come to the train at the Swimming Pool(MP C11.3 Oasis Sub).  Scott and I met Gary Kearny at the leaking tank car and gave a quick inspection and found the car was dripping once every 10 seconds and had duct tape along the bottom outlet valve for some unknown reason.  After the Car Shop Blue Flagged the train, James and I went under the car to find the valve was leaking at the handle. We tried moving the handle to see if we could close the valve any tighter, but shipping seal 103622 would not allow us to do so.  I asked Gary if we could move the car 3 to 4 miles to the customer to have it unloaded. Gary called Joel Roberts with the FRA and Joel said that the first step is to try and stop the leak by a Certified Tank Car Company and only then would “Washington” allow for a OTM and that move would not allow it to the customer, but to our yard.  At 1130 I called Eric Drumm with Drumm Inc. who are a local tank car company to help with this situation and while talking to them, I found at tag on the valve that showed this valve was last rebuilt by Drumm Inc themselves on 02/2018. Eric said he would have guys there by 1400. In the meantime, Rob Payne contacted the FRA to apply for the OTM to have the car moved to the yard.  Drumm Inc. arrived at 1415. We gave them a job briefing, gave them masks and headed to the car.  Terry and his assistant with Drumm Inc. inspected the valved and started to tighten the flange that holds the teflon valve packing material. Drumm Inc. was not able to stop the leak but slow it down due to the teflon packing material worn out. They were able to reduce the drip from 1 every 10 seconds to 1 drip every 60 seconds. I asked how long the valve was good for, and they said depending on frequency of use, 3 to 5 years. This valve is a little over 3 years old. While inspecting the car, they also found the safety cap gasket was not the correct size. Unable to remove the cap fully to replace the gasket due to shipping seal 103621 applied, the seal was removed, the gasket replaced and a seal from the FRA applied. This was the reasoning for the tape.  Rob contacted FRA in Washington and we were given permission and the OTM as long as the leak did not drip on any public crossings.

Gary contacted mechanical supervisor Nicholas Longshore at 1030hrs to state such, telling Nick that it was not a major leak, but a drip (every 10 seconds).  Car was 7th back from locomotive. Gary stated it was UN1170 Haz-Mat flammable liquid / Ethanol.  Crew responded with spill tub and blue flags.  Nick and Scott Wentz, AVP Mechanical, met Gary at leaking car and after quick inspection found duct tape long the bottom outlet valve.  Upon further inspection found valve was leaking at handle.  Tried moving handle to close the valve tighter, but shipping seal 103622 prevented this.  Nick asked Gary if car could be moved 3-4 miles to the customer for unloading.  Gary called Joel Roberts (FRA) who stated first step is to try and stop the leak by Certified Tank Car Company, and only then would ""Washington"" allow for a OTM and that move would only be to our yard - not customer.  1130hrs contacted Eric Drumm (Drumm Inc.) local tank car company for assistance. In conversation, it was found the tag on valve showed last rebuilt date of 2/2018 was by Drumm Inc themselves.  Eric dispatched his crew to site for 1400hrs arrival.  Meantime, Rob Payne, contacted FRA to apply for OTM to have car moved to yard.  1415hrs Drumm arrived, inspected valve and tried to tighten.  Due to teflon packing worn out, could not stop leak but slowed to a drip (every 60 seconds).  Valve is over 3yrs old with a life expectancy 3-5 years, depending on use. Drumm also found the safety cap gasket was not the correct size.  Tried to remove to replace gasket, but couldn't due to shipping seal 103622 applied.  Seal was removed, gasket replaced, and a seal from the FRA was applied.  This was the reasoning for the duct tape.  Rob contacted FRA in Washington and IORY and OTM were given permission as long as the leak did not drop on any public crossings.  Drumm taped a spill pad in the opening and around shaft. Car moved to MCYD to Track 09. Spill pads left there and placed tub under car.  Arrangements being made to transload car.","Suggest shipper to closely inspect cars for any defects and educate employees on risks and hazards.

When he closed the dome lid his dome-lid gasket became pinched or crushed near the hinge of the dome lid. He performed two leak checks but did not realize a small amount of acid was leaking from the pinch point. He exited property and stopped at a set of railroad tracks. The stopping of the vehicle caused the liquid to surge where the first small amount of acid was released on the roadway (US-60). The driver then drove towards his destination. I was informed that a vehicle owned by our company had left FMI property possibly leaking acid. I called the driver and had him pull over immediately to perform a leak check. He confirmed that a small amount of acid had leaked onto the ground where he came to a stop. He put a 5 gallon bucket under the drain hose to catch any additional drips. The only know release of sulfuric acid occurred at the RR tracks in Miami, AZ where the vehicle made a complete stop and also where the vehicle ultimately stopped on US-60 near MM-219. This was confirmed by our clean up response crew and by AZ DPS who drove the entire route.  Once the driver confirmed that his tanker was not sealed properly I contacted AZ DPS Duty Office, AZDOT HAZMAT and the NRC.","Drivers are trained to check their dome lid gaskets before closing their dome lids to make sure the gasket is seated properly. Once the dome lid is closed, drivers are required to inspect the edge of the dome lid with gloved hand to make sure the gasket has not become pinched or twisted before tightening wing nuts.

It was on a truck in the parking lot at the office. Employees saw the leak when they returned from jobs for that Saturday. When employees walked by the parked truck, the employees noticed a solvent smell. They inspected the truck and found a a small leak under the vehicle. Employees opened the back door of the truck and inspected all containers within the truck. Upon inspection it was determined that there was a small crease in a metal drum on the bottom of the container. The drum was placed in an 851A2 salvage drum to continue transportation to the ultimate disposal facility.     The drum leaked less than 1 pint of mixed solvents while in transit due to the crease. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent and the drum was over-packed into an appropriate 85 gallon salvage drum along with the clean up materials. The duration of release is anticipated to be a small drip from the drum for about 12 hours with no more than a quart leaking.   On 3/13/2021 the Veolia safety manager of Marlborough,MA was notified. The results of the investigation is that a drum had a small  crack in it due to human error when loading the container with a drum cart.  The container was inspected prior to shipping and did not have any issues. It appears that the leak was caused when the container was moved with a drum cart and the cart creased the metal drum and leaked overnight. The shipper was notified of the leak. It is unsure if the container was moved by a Veolia employee or the customer employee.","The cause of a spill was a crease in a 55 gallon drum while loading it and preparing it for transportation. Veolia employees must continue to inspect drums when handling prior to and during transportation and notify management upon discovery of a leaking container. Veolia will continue to review the causes of spills with employees the best method to over-pack a leaking container or to prevent any further leaking of containers. In this particular case, the container was inspected and looked as if it was OK to transport as offered. During the investigation, it was discovered that the container was damaged when being loaded into the truck. The shipper employees and Veolia employees helped with loading the drums. This was reported to the customer/shipper and more care will be used in the future to prevent a similar issue from happening again.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The trailer is fully loaded and an unknown amount has released at this time. At 1551 ET, Logiflex retained ERTS to coordinate response and remedial operations. ERTS dispatched E3 (environmental contractor) to respond, secure and clean the release. E3 personnel arrived on site and advised that appeared that two pallets (four drums on pallet) had shifted towards the nose of trailer; noted only one strap at the rear of the trailer; advised that there were two released material impacts on the asphalt surface outside of trailer: 1) near the rear of trailer measuring 4-ft wide x 20-ft in length; and 2) nose of the trailer, 3-ft wide x 10-ft in length. E3 personnel  identified one poly drum with puncture apparently from a nail from pallet; contractor inspected all drums during removal; puncture in drum was located at edge of bottom and side; as previously reported during initial assessment by contractor, the punctured drum was located on one of the pallets that shifted most likely during transit; estimated amount of material released is 30-gallons. E3 personnel confirmed all response/cleanup activities have been completed; all remaining drums/pallets reloaded to nose of trailer and straps added to pallets; E3 generated two, 55-gallon poly drums of solid waste (granular absorbents, PPE), and one, 95-gallon overpack poly drum containing the leaking 55-gallon punctured drum and contents (approximately 20-gallons); waste to be transported offsite to contactor facility pending profiling and disposal;",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND TRAININGSOLUTIONS,US,

When he turned up the pump speed to normal delivery flow one of his hoses blew near the end collar.  3-5 gallons hit the ground covering an area of 4 feet by 10 feet.  The customer handled clean up.  The hose was within its required inspection range (Schneider requirement of one year).  After inspecting we found that the lining was gouged inside which is usually a good indicator when it is close to the end that a tankwash ran a pressure washer wand inside and damaged it.,We unfortunately don't know which tankwash specifically caused this because not all hoses are used on every delivery so there is no telling when and where that one was cleaned.  That said our tankwash director has a weekly call with all the tankwashes in our network.  This was revisited with all of them.  He has also since put together a slide show presentation outlining a few hose related spills we had due to damaged lining in recent months (the others were all non-hazardous releases) to help reinforce the point.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

ERTS dispatched and environmental contractor to investigate, secure and remediate the release. The site contact, Jim Fowler, advised that when they began to offload the product they noticed the tanker leaking at the center valve. They believe that the gasket between the valve and the tank is leaking and allowing product to release near the valve. Approximately 5-gallons has been released underneath the tank and is forming a large puddle. Environmental Works stated that they have located the release. The stated that the facility personnel had cleaned some of the released material with oil dri. Some of the product did impact a puddle in the containment pit. It has been raining since the spill occurred and they estimated that the puddle now contains 1000-1500 gallons of impacted water. Environmental Works is currently utilizing the vacuum truck to collect the impacted water. Environmental Works stated that Chemisphere personnel tested the impacted water in their onsite lab. They stated that the tests came back within limits for their water permit and will be able to dispose of the water down the drain in the containment pit.

The product flowed to a tank that was undergoing maintenance and was released through open valves. Plant personnel in the vicinity smelled the acid and alerted the driver to stop the delivery. The sulfuric acid traveled into a concrete-lined industrial wastewater trench where it mixed with other wastewater streams from the plant and was neutralized.

There was labeling on the outside of the package indicating the shipment was a gift, and the Commercial Invoice document associated with the package specified the contents as crafts and candy. The package was seized by US Customs officials prior to disposition to the consignee to search for illegal substances. The package was subsequently returned to the FedEx Express destination station in Kentwood, MI after it had been opened and examined by Customs. The outer packaging was dampened by a small amount of liquid when it was returned and had several markings and seals indicating it had been inspected. Staff at the destination station were informed that several plastic bottles in the box contained liquid that was analyzed by Customs, and the liquid was determined to be nearly pure alcohol, perhaps being sent as moonshine. There were other items in the package that were not dangerous goods as well. Some of the inner containers also had tape on them with printing indicating that Customs had opened and inspected them, indicating they had been modified from the original condition they had been shipped in.
