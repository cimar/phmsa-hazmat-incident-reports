The terminal requested a contractor be dispatched. After arriving to the terminal, the contractor confirmed that approximately 5-gallons of product released to a 10' x 3' area of the trailer floor due to one of the ears being pulled back on the cam lock fittings of the valve plug causing the plug to fall out. The tote was re-secured with a rag and stuffed in the valve opening and the plug placed back on with the ears fastened, chem tape was then secured on the valve to secure the plug from falling back out. The contractor applied simple green solution to the trailer floor to eliminate the odor. ERTS then told the terminal that the trailer needed to be aired out longer and washed to further reduce the odor of the chemical. The debris was placed inside (1) 55-gallon metal drum.

The impacted bad of fertilizer was placed in a 55 gallon poly drum by itself due to the possible reaction the ""Biotrol 150"" could have with the magnesium in the fertilizer. Soda ash was placed in the drum with the fertilizer bag to minimize possible reaction.

There was ample time for driver of pickup to have seen our truck and reduced speed as to have not rear ended our bobtail.  The investigation is obviously not complete but it appears that the driver of the pickup was not paying attention.  The pickup struck our bobtail and dislodged the motor fuel tank and ruptured it and also cracked one of the pipe fittings on the piping.  It was a very small crack but it was leaking.  The driver of the vehicle was killed from the impact due to not wearing a seat belt and not from the propane release.  There was never a fire or explosion.  After the scene was clear and we had the bobtail towed back to our yard we flared off the entire cargo tank of product which was 1000 gallons.  This was to reduce pressure on tank and piping so further incident did not occur.,After reviewing the site of the incident it appeared we did everything correctly from a standard operating procedure stand point.  However we can always improve our safety awareness.  I recommended using our hazardous lights when pulling into traffic as another warning to all other motorists that a slow moving truck is entering the highway.  Also I recommended we roll down our window just as a reminder to double check looking for motorists before we enter the roadway.  This will also add another sensory mechanism(hearing) to the equation which will just make every driver more aware.  As far as the packaging is concerned I feel like the truck held up considerably well considering the high rate of speed at impact without a major release of product.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6540,Diamondback Propane,US,

It was reported that one - 55 gallon drum containing UN2922 ""BONDERITE C-AD Deocdzr 16R Aero (TURCO oxidizer 16 REPL)"" damaged due to a nail puncture through the drum resulting in the release of at least 15 gallons of material to the trailer floor. The trailer is located at the Dohrn facility in Janesville, WI and requires a response team to overpack the damaged drum and clean the impacted trailer. Reportedly the initial response was performed by Dohrn personnel who secured the drum by rolling the hole to the top to stop the leak. At 1230 ET, HEPACO arrived on site and discovered trailer #055228 filled with impacted debris and the damaged 55 Gallon drum of material.

He reported seeing a liquid under a skid marked as HAZMAT. Tenerio and I exited the trailer after taking pictures of the shipment and pulling information off of the skid.  Upon investigation, it  was discovered the pro was not yet billed, and had incorrect Hazmat classifications on the customer BOL. I approached City dispatch to retrieve the physical BOL since no info could be pulled digitally about the shipment. After getting the information about the shipment,  I called Safety and securit y and spoke with Tyler Shook. After exchanging pictures and documentation with Tyler, he advised me to hold the Trailer in 33 door and wait to hear back from them regarding a spill team being dispatched. ~Spill team has completed their work with the assistance of Ronald Hutchens. A total of 10 five gallon buckets in the shipment were damaged and leaking. The contractor suspects that the pallet was wrapped too tightly and the handles dug into the pails and caused the damage to the pails during transit.

The caller advised that the release impacted a trailer floor (trailer #313-9565) and the drums were still leaking. The caller also advised that it looked like the release had occurred due to pinhole in the drums which might have occurred due to improper loading of the freight for transport. Following a review of the incident and the reported material involved, ERTS determined that a contractor needs to be sent to the site to conduct the cleanup process. The contractor confirmed that approximately 5 ounces of the product released from (1) 15-gallon plastic drum container due to the container having a pinhole. Only the trailer floor was impacted.

There was no call out for leaking damaged Hazmat so unclear how and who brought to the table. Unclear if the package handlers wiped up spill there was no communication. The label was cleared away due to them putting the box in the tote upside so had to wait for missed scan report to figure out the tracking id for the package.

The 14 gallon fiber drum was saturated about 40% up the drum but no hazardous materials were released beyond the 14 gallon fiber drum.  Inside of the drum were 4 x 1 gallon glass bottles containing hydrochloric acid solution, triethylamine, aresenate, acetic acid solution (10-50% in  water), glycine, and sodium hydroxide solution.  It appears the contents of the glass inner containers froze due to the cold outside temperatures.  When the contents froze it may have cracked the glass  inner containers which resulted in the spill when the temperatures were no longer freezing.  There was approximately 1 pint of hazardous material that was released from the inner glass containers.  The  spilled material was absorbed by the absorbent material packed inside the outer packaging but the outside of the 14 gallon fiber was dampened by the release.  The 14 gallon container was bagged and overpacked to  prevent further release while in transportation.","To help prevent a recurrence, the hazard of freezing temperatures causing containers to break has been shared with the employees.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

IN REVIEW OF THE DRIVER POST TRIP INSPECTION THE TRUCK IS DOT COMPLIANT, AND NO LEAKS ARE NOTED. THE WASTE IS MANIFESTED AS HAZARDOUS WASTE LIQUID NOS (LEAD) WITH A RCRA CODE OF D008. ON THE MORNING OF 03-27-19, THE DRIVER WAS GOING TO TRANSPORT THE TRUCK SC-5012 TO CLEAN EARTH OF NORTH JERSEY FOR DISPOSAL. HE NOTICED A DRIP FROM THE REAR DOOR DURING HIS PRE-TRIP INSPECTION, PLACED A BUCKET UNDER THE DRIP, AND CALLED DISPATCH AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 AM. AT THAT TIME THE PUDDLE WAS LESS THAN 2 FEET IN DIAMETER. DISPATCH DIRECTED B.POWELL AND N. ZAMBRANO TO USE ANOTHER TRUCK, PV-4130, TO TRANSFER THE LOAD. PV-4130 HAS EXACTLY THE SAME TYPE OF WASTE IN IT FROM THE SAME GENERATOR. AS THEY WERE TRANSFERRING THE LOAD, A SMALL SECTION OF WELD, ON THE TOP FRONT OF THE TANK ON SC-5012 STARTED TO ALSO LEAK. IT WAS A VERY SMALL LEAK FROM PIN HOLES IN ABOUT 3"" OF THE WELD. ONE OF THE DRIVERS PLACED A BUCKET UNDER THE TRUCK TO CATCH THE DRIPS. THE TEAM CONTINUED TO TRANSFER THE LOAD TO ALLEVIATE BOTH LEAKS.  AT ABOUT 10:30 AM NICK PREVOSTI AND MAUREEN TROESCHER, ACV ENVIRO-EH&S MANAGERS, WERE ALSO NOTIFIED. THEY CONFIRMED THE LEAKS AND EXTENT OF THE SPILL WERE CONTAINED. THERE WAS LESS THAN 50 GALLONS OF LIQUID IN THE VICINITY OF THE TRUCK, AND THE YARD SUPERVISOR HAD ALREADY PLACED A SPEEDI DRY BERM AROUND THE PUDDLES, NJDEP WAS NOTIFIED AT AROUND 12:00PM - INCIDENT # 19-03-27-1241-32.  THE DRIP FROM THE BACK OF SC-5012 STOPPED BEFORE ALL THE MATERIAL WAS REMOVED. APPARENTLY, THE WEIGHT OF THE LOAD WAS CAUSING THE REAR DOOR LEAK. THE LOAD WAS LOWERED ENOUGH SO THAT WASTE WAS FAR BELOW THE CRACKED WELD. ALL MATERIAL WAS VACUUMED BACK INTO SC-5012. ANY WASTE ON THE ACTUAL VEHICLE WAS WIPED OFF THE EXTERIOR AND THOSE PADS WERE ALSO VACUUMED BACK INTO THE TRUCK. SC-5012 HAD NO LEAKS AT THIS POINT. BOTH TRUCKS WERE SENT TO CLEAN EARTH FOR DISPOSAL. THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY OUT OF SERVICE FOR INSPECTION AND REPAIR. ONCE AT THE FACILITY BASED ON STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING THIS CUSTOMER WASTE, A TCLP ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED AND IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE MATERIALS WAS NON-HAZARDOUS WITH LEAD FAR BELOW RCRA CHARACTERISTIC LEVEL.","PROPER SPILL PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED ONCE SPILL WAS IDENTIFIED. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, PAILS WERE PLACED UNDER THE DRIPS AND SPEEDI DRY WAS POURED AROUND ANY PUDDLES TO ENSURE CONTAINMENT. THE LEAKS ON SC-5012 WERE ALLEVIATED BY TRANSFERRING SOME OF THE MATERIAL INTO ANOTHER TRUCK WITH THE SAME WASTE FROM SAME GENERATOR. SC-5012 WILL HAVE ALL WELDS CHECKED AND GASKET REPLACED.

The car was isolated and Hazmat responders notified to inspect the car.  Upon inspection, BNSF Hazmat responders noted the vapors to be coming from the Salco Tri-vent rupture disk assembly.  Inspection through the inspection port showed that the rupture disk was intact and in place, however HCl vapor was escaping around the disk.  A contractor was dispatched with a replacement rupture disk to assist with replacement and further inspection.  When removed, the disk was found to have partially delaminated the gasket and thus not providing an adequate seal.  A new rupture disk was installed and the car was decontaminated and allowed to continue in transportation.",Rupture disks should be regularly inspected and replaced as part of a standard procedure.

Company employees (Aircraft Mechanics) prepared the shipment to travel on two ""cargo aircraft only"" non-revenue, re-position flights to return the expired extinguishers to Company Headquarters.   Nome employees instructed the pilots of the first aircraft to deliver the extinguishers to Unalakleet, Alaska, a hub airport, for transfer to a Company cargo aircraft that was expected later that day.   Because the flights were on non-revenue re-position flight, employees completed cargo manifests but failed to follow company procedures on Hazmat acceptance. Subsequently, hazmat paperwork and PIC notification forms were not created for the shipment.   The extinguishers were flown to Unalakleet on 3-20-19 as COMAT.   The expected Company freighter aircraft never arrived at Unalakleet due to aircraft maintenance issues and the extinguishers were stored in the Cargo building overnight.   The next day, a Company revenue passenger flight operated into Unalakleet. Ramp agents at the Unalakleet station loaded the extinguishers onto the aircraft as COMAT. Because the shipment did not have hazmat paperwork and associated PIC notification paperwork, the units were loaded onto the aircraft and assumed to not be hazmat.   The aircraft flew without incident to Anchorage, Alaska on 3-21-19.  Cargo Agents offloading the aircraft identified the Fire Extinguishers as improperly shipped hazmat and reported the improperly documented shipment to the company.   The company filed a Voluntary Disclosure Report with the FAA.","The Company found the root cause of this event to be the shipping employees failure to follow HAZMAT shipping protocol due to the first flight being a non-revenue, re-position flight. The corrective action determined by our Company was to require all shipments to follow Cargo acceptance procedures regardless whether the flight is non-revenue re-position or passenger carrying.   The Company Director of Airports reviewed the violations and the requirements to comply with HAZMAT shipping procedures with the Unalakleet and Nome Airport managers immediately after becoming aware of the incident. (3-27-19)  The Company Director of Aircraft Maintenance mandated that his mechanics can no longer initiate and or accept shipments on non-revenue flights and that all shipments must be initiated by trained Company Cargo Agents in accordance with Company cargo and hazmat acceptance and loading policies.

Unauthorized personnel handled the leaking Hazmat package placing it in lined Hazmat tote on low level slow moving conveyor belt. Package passed several employees that are required to look for adhesive tags with door numbers attached to packages to ensure the package is directed to the correct area of the bldg. Damaged Hazmats are not given such identifiers and therefor prompting employees to search harder for said tags unaware of the dangers inside the tote. It is unknown if any employees or their property were affected by handling these pkgs.   Caps loose on 4 x 1 gal plastic bottles which allowed a small amount of liquid to leak while the package was on its side.Liquid contained to and absorbed by the carton.
