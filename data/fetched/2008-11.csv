A small amount of liquid release was also observed from the top of UTLX 641170 during movement. Movement was stopped and no product release was observed when UTLX 641170 remained motionless, but the chemical odor persisted. UTLX 641170 was cordoned-off in the railyard. BNSF contract responders inspected UTLX 641170 finding 2 of 8 of the manway securement bolts less than tool tight. All other valves and fittings were found secure. The intact manway seal numbered 0041755 was removed to check the product outage level and the manway gasket condition. The outage level was gauged and deemed appropriate. The manway gasket was intact and did not appear to be deficient. The responders replaced this manway gasket to ensure that a good seal was provided by the installation of a new Viton manway gasket. Afterwards, the manway was closed, properly secured and resealed with seal numbered 001358. The product spillage on the outer shell and a small amount found atop the ground ballast below was neutralized. An industrial odor-masking agent (OD 62) was sprayed upon the impacted area of the outer tank shell and the ground ballast to eliminate the chemical odor. UTLX 641170 was moved (agitated) at its location and no further product leakage was observed. Response was concluded by 0130 hrs.

PATRICK KELLEY,SAFETY SPECIALIST,,,,,Carrier,"ABF driver John Drozdowski, upon his arrival at the ABF Tomah, Wisconsin facility noticed that there was some product loss on the top of a closed top drum that was Hazardous. It is unclear how the packaging failed, as no one tried to unload the drum with a drum cart, and the loading terminal loaded   these drums with a fork lift. The ABF driver called our Safety and Security department, who advised the ABF driver that an Emergency response team would do the clean up. HAZ-MAT ONE responded to the call, and determined that there was a small puncture near the top ring of the drum. Product loss was   limited to 2 cups and was put in one small drum along with PPE and other clean up debris. This puncture may have been caused by a drum grabber, but not for certain.","Check all future shipments from this shipper to ensure that the product they are shipping have no small indentations that might compromise the integrity of the container.

DUring the course of the trip, the vehicle made a routine stop at Clean Harbors in transit storage facility for the purpose of transferring the shipment to an alternate vehicle for continuing transportation.  During the transfer operation, a fork-lift operator struck 2 55 gallon containers with the forks of the lift when he attempted to stop the lift.  this resulted in the puncture of 2 containers.  As a result of htis incident, approximatley 100 gallons of material escaped onto the floor of the van trailer and the secondary containment truck parking location.  The facility immdiatley activated it's internal emergency response plan and steps were taken to overpack the damaged containers and absorbe all free liquids.  ALl debris collected from the area and recontainerized for disposal and were sent for dispoal to the intended waste managemetn facility.  In addition, the vehicle was decontaminated and put back into service.","In order to prevent a recurrence, the fork-lift operator will be retrained on the proper operation of mechanical handling devices.  We also believe that environmental factors contributed to the incident.  At the time of the incident it was raining and it is believed that the fork-lift failed to stop due to wet pavement.

CRPX 986035 was cordoned off in the railyard. A BNSF mechanical responder inspected CRPX 986035 and no leak source was found, but a slight product odor was detectable. The local F.D. arrived and also inspected CRPX 986035 and other railcars nearby. The F.D. found no leaks and detected no product odor. Afterwards, the BNSF switch crew resumed switching and shortly thereafter reported the same petroleum gas odor. Again the area around CRPX 986035 was cordoned off. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected CRPX 986035 and determined that the odor source emanated at the sample valve port. The consignee (Chevron) was contacted and their response team arrived at 0515 hrs. PST, 11/03/08 to inspect and repair CRPX 986035. The consignee response team tightened the sample line valve stem packing retainer one full turn by 0650 hrs. PST, but a slightly detectable product odor persisted. It was assumed that the sample valve packing was deficient and CRPX 986035 was delivered to Chevron for unloading by 0740 hrs. PST, 11/03/08.   At 0750 hrs. PST on 11/08/08, CRPX 986035 (now a residue shipment billed by Chevron) was reported emanating a residue product odor at the BNSF Barstow, CA railyard. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected CRPX 986035 and found a rag wrapped around the sample line pipe. The sample line pipe was cold to the touch indicating that residue product vapor was escaping up through the sample line pipe. The responder applied a sealant compound into the pipe nipple's threaded area and into the threads of the valve body. The sealant compound was worked into the threads by turning the valve body 1/4 turn. Afterwards, the residue product odor was no longer detectable. Home shop disposition was requested for CRPX 986035 and it was forwarded accordingly.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Pressure,112JW,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The driver ran off of the interstate crashing into a guardrail and a bridge abutment causing substantial damage to the undercarriage of the truck and a rollover. At some point a fuel tank was ruptured and a fire was ignited. The tractor was totally destroyed and the fire impinged upon the cargo tank. The vapor pressure within the tank was enough to overcome the relief devices installed on the unit. As a result the integrity of the tank was compromised and cause the pressure to release in the area of the intense heat exposure, just behind the king pin. The release was mostly vapor and was of a short duration according to the fire chief on the scene.

No chemical odor was noticed and no railcars were observed leaking any commodity. Later, another chemical odor complaint surfaced. BNSF responders along with contract responders were dispatched to the Slaton railyard. During the detailed inspection of the railcars in the yard, the responders reported finding UTLX 642768 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) emanating a chemical odor via the manway closure. No release of liquid commodity was evident. The manway gasket was out of position (bulged outward and protruded over the manway nozzle lip) which prevented a good gasket seal. After the manway cover was opened, a small cut (3-4 inches in length) was visible running lengthwise across a portion of this gasket. Responders replaced this gasket with a new suitable manway gasket and resecured the manway cover.

FELIX,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT,P.O. Box 1198,CAROLINA,PR,00986,Shipper,"During highway transportation of a hazardous waste shipment between Carolina P.R. and Mayagüez, P.R.; while passing through the municipality of Isabela, P.R., the transportation vehicle was cut off by another motor vehicle.  The incident required the truck driver to implement an emergency stop in order to avoid an accident.  The sudden stop caused movement of the truck’s cargo. In particular several 5-gallon plastic pails, that had been sheen-wrapped together, shifted forward.  One of the pails was punctured by a nail from the palette directly in front of it, that had apparently been damaged during the sudden stop.  The puncture hole was approximately .25 inches in length.  This information was not immediately known to the driver because the cargo container had security seals.  After the incident the driver stopped and reviewed the outside of the container and did not observe any leaks.  He continued his trip and upon arriving at the Lilly del Caribe, Inc. plant in Mayagüez, reported the incident.  Upon opening the cargo container, the punctured pail was discovered lying on its side with approximately one gallon of liquid still inside.  The truck bed was also found to be wet and some material started to drip from the truck bed onto the roadbed during the truck inspection at the Lilly gate.  No sign of spillage was found outside Lilly property.    The pail was immediately removed in order to control the release.  The truck bed and affected roadbed was dried with absorbent material and the truckbed was also mopped and decontaminated.  Since the Mayagüez facility is a RCRA Treatment, Storage, and Disposal (TSD) facility all liquid waste collected was treated on-site.  Solid waste was disposed off according to applicable RCRA Hazardous Waste regulations.",As part of the incident investigation it was determined that improved sheen-wrapping techniques needed to be implemented to assure not only that pails are wrapped together but that they are firmly fastened to their respective palettes.   More specific instructions will be given to personnel on how to better prepare shipments for transportation. The practice of assuring that only palettes in good condition are used for shipments was already in place so the palette involved in the puncturing is assumed to have been damaged during the braking incident.    The use of metal grating palettes with side walls is being considered for future shipments of plastic pails.  This should prevent pails from tipping over or moving during future shipments.  In addition the use of stronger wooden or metal palettes is being considered for all waste shipments.,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Lilly del caribe, Inc.

BNSF and contract responders were summoned to investigate, determine the odor source and take corrective measures to eliminate the odor. Inspections revealed ECUX 374027 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) on an adjacent track emanating a product odor. Seal XOM 010385 was removed from the valve's protective housing cover to inspect valve securement. Responders found ECUX 374027's vapor valve (VV) 1/2 turn loose on its threaded connection into a one inch reducer pipe. Also, the vacuum relief valve (VRV) was two turns loose at its threaded connection into the tank car. After the VV and VRV were tool tightened, no further product odor was evident.

Pressure was relieved and the responder removed the closure cap. The cap was cleaned; Teflon tape applied to the threaded area and the cap was reapplied to a tool tight condition.

After the manway cover was opened to reposition the gasket alignment, the responder noted that the gasket itself was cracked and torn in two locations along the circumference of the gasket. The responder surmised that deterioration of the gasket resulted in the gasket damage rather than the misalignment.

While unloading the driver noticed product bubbling and knocking the stomp down off. This caused approximately 8 gallons of fuel to spill onto the concrete. The driver immediately shut off the flow of product and no product reached soil or drains. The driver then took stick readings and veeder root readings and both showed that the tank could hold another 250 gallons. The driver notified the attendant and manager at the site. He utilized oil dry to absorb the spill. The stomp down was checked and was determined to be in good working order, further investigation revealed that the flapper was closing early and caused the hose to jump and knock off the fitting. The site manager replace the faulty flapper and accepted responsibility for the incident.","The fauly part on the tank, the excess fill flapper/valve was replaced.

At the time of loading, the ash was loaded at a temperature above ambient temperture which we suspect allowed condensation to form on the exterior of the liner.  During the course of transportation, it was discovered that a small amount (less than 1 gallon or 8 solid pounds)leaked from the rear of the dump trailer.  It is believed that the condensation formed as the material cooled collected on the exterior of the liner allowing the liquid (believed to be water) to release from a small pinole in the dum trailer body.  Upon identification of the situation, a third party contractor was secured to travel to the scene to absorbe all free liquids and secure the truck for continued transportation.  ALl clean-up debris was placed in the dump trailer and disposed of at the intended waste management facility.    It is our belief that the materia released was simply condensation but due to the fact that the dump trailer contained a hazardous waste, it was reported as a hazardous materials incident.","In order to prevent a recurrence, the loading facility has been informed of the incident nad have been requested to inspecte each shipment prior to offering for transportation to insure that any condensation is removed and the presence of any free liquid is addressed.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,780,"Clean Harbors Environemntal Services, Inc.",US,

Byron Smith Oil bulk plant.  When driver Bomar arrived, no A. Byron Smith Oil personnel were present.  Driver Bomar attempted to unload the product without the assistance of bulk plant personnel.  After connecting all of the piping Bomar began the unloading process.  After a short period of time Bomar noticed product escaping from the cargo tank overflow valve(vapor line), Bomar immediately shut down the unloading process.  The spillage ran down a alley road surface onto a concrete empty parking lot.  Bomar failed to close a discharged valve from the bulk piping which caused product to be pumped from the bulk storage into the cargo tank and overflow.  Bomar did not realize the discharged valve from the bulk piping was open until he had shut the unloading procedure down.  Estimated time of product release is 3-5 minutes.  Product released did not reach any type of public or natural waterway.","Driver Bomar is trained in the loading/unloading procedures at Foster Fuels, and has unloaded at this facility in the past.  In this particular delivery, Bomar attempted to unload without the assistance of bulk plant personnel.  Foster Fuels will not longer permit unloading/loading at this facility without the assistance of bulk personnel.  Foster Fuels would recommend bulk plants to post unloading/loading procedures, mark all piping, and unloading/loading not be premitted without the assistance of company personnel.  No type of equipment failure is attributed to this incident.  Foster Fuels will continue to provide training in the furture to all of its HM employees.  This incident has been made a part of Justin Bomar's employment record at Foster Fuels Inc.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,16000,Foister Fuels Inc,US,

Driver said his work assignment said to use air pressure.  Customer said that was fine.  Customer had a 1500 gallon tank that was empty.  Driver was delivering 1300 gallons.  That would allow for 200 gallon headspace in the tank.  Driver  had the air line half closed to keep psi between 15-25.  When the discharge line went empty and the hose jumped, driver was right there and immediately closed the discharge valve on the cargo tank. The cap on the customer tank raised up and sprayed product on the side of the cement block building.  Driver said it was a 16"" cap that locks on with only 1 turn. Product also sprayed out of the vent on the side of the tank. Driver and plant employee were unsure how much spilled.  Driver said less that 50 gallons which is probably an overestimate.","Not sure if using air pressure was an issue, cap on tank not properly secured or maybe air vent to tank was plugged allowing pressure to build up?

The car was isolated and the shipper was notified via CHEMTREC (Report 2008-11-28-00052). SWS, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that the liquid eduction ball valve was open slightly and the valve plug was not installed. Contractor personnel closed the valve, installed the valve plug tool tight and applied soda ash to neutralize the released acid. The leak was secured and the car released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move.    An AAR QA Program, 7.1 Nonconformance Report was not completed for this incident.

The skid of paint was stacked on top of another skid of paint, with another skid of paint stacked on top of it, with nothing but a piece of plywood used as dunnage for blocking.  On the other side of the plywood was a smaller pallet and about 1 ft. of empty space. While in transit the top skid of paint shifted over and was leaning on the edge of the paint that was spilled.  The spilled was caused by the above pallet leaning over placing its weight on a single can of paint in the box below.  The side of the can of paint buckled under the pressure breaking the seal of the lid causing approx. 4 ounces of the paint to leak out and onto the trailer floor.  The can was leaking for approx. 3 hours (drive time from Dallas, TX to Shreveport, LA).",Additional blocking and bracing could have prevented this incident form occurring.

Further inspection of VCSX 147 by a BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder determined that the tank shell was compromised at the aforementioned location and therefore necessitated product transfer. Product drips impacting the ground evaporated. VCSX 147 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard for immediate product transfer. The product in VCSX 147 was transferred into tank trucks without further incident by 0430 hrs. PST, 11/29/08. Afterwards, VCSX 147 was cleaned and purged of hazardous material. On 12/18/2008 movement approval FRA-08120429 was issued to forward VCSX 147 to an approved repair facility for appropriate repairs.

The tote started leaking out the floor of the truck and left a trail on the highway and into the parking lot of the high school where the truck was delivering to.

They immediately called the local fire department and the local has mat response team. They shut down the highway as a precautionary measure. The school was closed that day due to it being Veterans Day so there were no students there. There was a staff of 10 at the school which was evacuated even though it was leaking a small amount in the parking lot away from the school. It started raining while this was happening. 55 gallon drums were placed under the truck to catch the remaining hypochlorite solution leaking out while waiting for SET Environmental, Inc. to me in and clean up the back of the truck.

WEISS,NATION EMERGENCY RESPONSE MANAGER,1875 W Main Street,BARTOW,FL,33830,Other-Spill Management Company,"On Wednesday, November 19, 2008, at 1215 hours CST, Ms. Stephanie Tudors, Claims Adjuster from Covenant Transport’s Group Risk Management/Claims Department (CTG) contacted American Compliance Technologies, Inc (A•C•T) Nationwide Emergency Response Manager Mr. Gary L. Weiss to request assistance for a hazardous material spill of Dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE).  Tractor-trailer # 10941 was reported to be traveling northbound on I-81 at mile marker 59 left the roadway and traveled through a line of trees and hit a unoccupied barn.  As a result of the accident and the abrupt stop, the cargo in the trailer was propelled forward.  The trailer broke open spilling 14 55-gallon drums DMAE onto the ground.  The remaining drums in the trailer were damaged and dislodged throughout the trailer.  A review of the Bill of Lading showed the tractor-trailer was carrying 80 55-gallon drums of DMAE, each weighing 720 kilograms. DMAE is listed as UN 2051, Class 8.3 Packaging Group II.  It’s a clear, colorless liquid with a strong ammonia-like odor.  DMAE’s primary hazard is being a corrosive agent and secondary hazard is its flammability. The flash point is 32 degrees Celsius, has a vapor pressure of 0.89 at 22 degrees Celsius and is completely solubility in water. The National Fire Protection Association 704 marking system lists Health Hazard Rating of 3, and a Flammability Hazard Rating of 2.    Upon arrival at the site, our response team determined that the Kingsport Fire Department (KFD) had evacuated nearby homes due to the concerns over anyone coming in contact with the DMAE vapors.  Approximately 15 residents were temporarily evacuated due to this incident.  After the KFD completed air monitoring, the evacuated residents were allowed back at approximately 1630 hours CST.      Fourteen (14) drums were outside the trailer and leaking, with 67 drums still inside the damaged trailer.  All the drums were propelled forwarded during the accident; a basic visual inspection reveled that the majority of the drums were damaged.  The KFD had uprighted the drums outside of the trailer to prevent any further leaking.  A decontamination station was established by the KFD for all responders.    Mr. Weiss and our response team developed a plan of action to cleanup the site.  A drum staging area would be established and lined with poly sheeting.  All drums would be moved to the staging area to be overpacked.  This would require cutting the trailer open to gain access to the drums inside the trailer.  Once this was completed, soil samples would be collected to determined if any soil would be required to be excavated. Any remaining diesel fuel in the tractor’s saddletanks would also be removed.    Mr. Weiss contacted Mr. David Anderson of BASF, the shipper who confirmed that Level B Personnel Protective Equipment would be required.  This would consist of butyl rubber suits and self-contained breathing apparatus.  Our cleanup plan of action was reviewed with Mr. Anderson who approved",Continued driver training to better prepare the driver for unusually situations.,Yes,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,149000,"American Compliance Technologies, Inc.",US,

The trailer was partially loaded and load locks were in place to stabilize the load. After going onto the shoulder and down a heavily wooded embankment, the load of drums and buckets shifted and lost approximately 30 gallons of product (liquid).   This accident occurred on a newly paved section of 1-75. The truck slid off the road after the trailer Jack knifed on a slick rainy road. The truck traveled through the forested median knocking down some trees in its path. The tractor was mangled and tree limbs punctured the trailer. When It came to a stop, the diesel saddle bags were ripped off and some drums and buckets were knocked over inside the trailer. Approximately 30 gallons of product from the containers were spilled in the trailer. Diesel was spilled on the ground.   A Hazmat crew from MEl mobilized immediately. Upon arrival on the scene they dressed in appropriate P.P. E. and entered the trailer. They applied a clay based absorbent to the liquid In the trailer. Equipped with the MSDS and manifests and aware of the substances Involved In the wreck, they instructed the Government E.R. personnel of the properties of the waste. Once the truck was moved, the Hazmat crew excavated the soil where the diesel spilled. The following day the crew returned and restored the property with topsoil and seed.   The soil was tested and disposed of at a class C landfill. The residue in the truck was put in drums and sent to A.E.S. for disposal.","The rainy conditions, coupled with a light load on new pavement caused this accident. The driver had a stellar record of 23 years without an accident. He was not speeding.   As a result of the incident we plan to have morning weather bulletins and instructions to all our drivers.

One top stacked IBC toward the container nose damaged the top of the IBC below it. Apparently the weight of the top IBC collapsed the metal cage surrounding the lower IBC which punctured the IBC's rigid poly bladder allowing product to escape. The remaining product within the damaged IBC was transferred into another suitable IBC.

The plant manager on the seen said the there was some product escaping from the pressure gauge opening and that they were going to try and plug that opening. I then called and notified the IDNR of the incident at 4:50 pm. At this time the amount of product had not been determined.   Throughout the evening hours of November 25, 2008 I was in constant communication with Ted Peterson of the IDNR. At 6:30 pm on November 25, 2008, Agriland FS, Inc. General Manager had arrived on scene to help determine a way of moving the tank off of the gravel road. At 7:28 pm, it had been determined to go ahead and call the National Response Center to report a possible release of anhydrous ammonia that would exceed the reportable quantity of 100 lbs. The report number from National Response is 891013.  The weather conditions had become extremely calm with some humidity and would no longer allow the Agriland FS, Inc employees to get close enough to the tank to do anymore work as the vapor was just hanging in the air. At 8:21 pm on November 25, 2008, I then called the Warren County Emergency Management Coordinator for assistance. At that time Mahala Cox (Warren Co. Emergency Management Coordinator) called in the fire department to hel with the situation. The fire department then requested the HAZMAT team from Des Moines. I then notified Ted Peterson (IDNR) that the Warren Co Emergency Management Coordinator had been notified and that HAZMAT had been called at approximately 8:51 pm.  Ted Peterson (IDNR) called me back at 11:33 pm to let me know that he had been in contact with the HAZMAT team to help with suggestions and wanted a phone number of a person on scene that might have better reception, since he lost contact. I provided Ted Peterson with the contact that I had been communicating with.  John Knobloch, Agriland FS, Inc General Manager, called me at 1:13 am on November 26, 2008 to inform me that Mahala Cox (Warren Co Emergency Management Coordinator) and the HAZMAT team decided to barricade the gravel road and abandon the scene for the evening, since there was no air movement and not much vapor escaping at that time. this would allow employees of Agriland FS, Inc. to return that morning to attempt to recover the product during daylight hours and safer conditions.  i arrived on scene at 9:23 am on November 26, 2008 and met with Mahala Cox. At this time we did not see any product being released. At 10:00 am the other Agriland FS, Inc. employee showed up on scene to help determine the best way to move the nurse tank and recover the product.
