The other 1-5 gallon did not release any product, it was only dented. The impacted trailer is no longer at the terminal as the pails were staged on the dock on a piece of cardboard.

Further inspection by CR Richter and Hepaco (CR's emergency response contractor) noted slight dripping originating from the bottom outlet valve stem where it was attached to the valve operating handle.  Due to its location up inside the tank car jacket (tank car jacketed/insulated), further inspection and repair was prohibitive.      A bucket with chemical absorbant pads was rigged under the outlet valve stem.  Due to a further inspection of remaining contents inside the tank through the manway, and those contents estimated between 10-15 gallons, it was decided that the car will be cleaned and purged on Monday, April 10.  Car will then be billed to home shop for inspection/repair/replacement of the internal bottom outlet valve.","During the venting of the car's internal pressure prior to ability to safely open the manway cover, it was gauged that there was 18 psi of pressure in the car, seemingly excessive for what's required to unload the car.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Consolidated Rail Corporation,US,

While attempting to navigate the one lane road the trailer tires slide off the pavement and the weight of the trailer pulled it off the road, down an embankment. The angle of the trailer caused the product to flood the dome lid area allowing the product to seep from the improperly secured dome lid. Driver called in and wrecker was dispatched to the scene and upon arrival it was determined another wrecker was needed to secure the scene and prevent a rollover.  Upon arrival a wrecker driver noticed the smell of the product which made us aware the trailer was leaking.  Efforts were made at the time to collect the material dripping from the trailer and an environmental company was contacted.  Washington County Public Safety arrived on scene and secured the area including evacuating the four homes in a 150 foot radius. Product was trans loaded into another trailer.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Sulcom, was notified via CHEMTREC Report #2017-0402-00016.  Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that 3 of the 8 manway cover swing bolts were less than tool tight.  Additionally, MEI found that a buildup of solidified sulfur on the manway nozzles sealing surface was preventing an even closure of the manway nozzle cover.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative Kelle Brown (281-907-9275).  Ms. Brown did note that while Sulcom, Inc. is the shipper of record for this load; the car is loaded and secured by a third party company- Canal Terminal Logistics, Channahon, IL.  Contractor personnel opened the manway, inspected the manway gasket, removed the solidified sulfur form the nozzles sealing surface, and properly secured all manway cover bolts.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Altivia, was notified via CHEMTREC Report #2017-0410-00130.  Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI), a CSX response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that product was leaking from the threaded connection between the vacuum relief valve (VRV)  and the tank car.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative (Luke Carey 740-533-5211).  MEI was able to tighten the connection of the VRV to the car; however, this did not stop the release.  MEI then removed the VRV and installed a solid pipe plug which secured the release.

The trailer once fully loaded was destined to the intended waste disposal facility. The RTN forklift operator misjudged the clearance and punctured a drum in the van trailer with the forklift blade while carrying/loading a pallet of drums. The CHES driver was in no way involved with the loading or unloading process. Raytheon emergency response personnel was immediately summoned, donned personal protective equipment maneuvered the drum to stop the leak.  The contents of the punctured drum were transferred into an empty drum.  Absorbents were deployed onto the truck, and were collected and drummed. The area beneath the truck was inspected, and showed no indication of the released material. The shipment was then loaded without further incident. The initial estimates of the spill was approximately 2 to 5 gallons; but it was later estimated to be 1 to 2 gallons.  The Driver notified his supervisor of the spill who then notified the CHES's Transportation Compliance Specialist, Albert Giraldez. The spill was reported to the MA DEP on 4/6/17 at 13:18 to Ken Sanderson; the tracking number 3-34158 was assigned.  DEP subsequently contacted the Andover Fire Department; no emergency responders were deployed to the site.","To prevent this incident from occurring again, Raytheon removed the powered industrial truck license from the fork lift operator, pending their full training.  Raytheon has also changed their loading procedures to include the use of a pallet jack rather than a forklift and a second person to serve as a spotter.

The unit was immediately moved to the containment pit and United Pumping was dispatched for the required response.     Upon arrival, United Pumping observed the container leaking at the containment pit. Approximately one gallon leaked onto the containment pit floor. The interior inspection revealed cases of the Hazardous Material (Marine Pollutant) stacked in two rows and two layers in height; stretch wrapped and palletized. The container deck was saturated with leaking product and several of the cases are leaking. No methods of securement to prevent cargo movement was observed in this shipment. It appears the cargo has shifted and the weight stowed on top  is crushing the cases at the bottom layers.  United Pumping personnel responded trackside to clean the leaking product from the ground.  An empty 40' container was mobilized by the shipper for transfer operations.    During the remediation of the leaking unit by United Pumping, a total of (4) cartons were discovered leaking. Each carton contained (2) plastic bottles (2.5 gallons each) of BRANDT GH ZINC (Hazardous Material). All (8) bottles in the compromised cartons were empty; resulting in a total of (20) gallons of leaked product. The leaking cartons were found at both upper and lower layers; at the rear, midpoint and nose section of the container. Bottles at upper layers were compromised when adjacent pallets shifted and punctured the bottles. Bottle at lower layers were compromised due to excessive weight stowed directly on top.  United Pumping completed transfer of cargo into TGHU519314. Cargo was stowed only one layer in height and properly secured with Air Bags and Ty Gard applications, at midpoint and the rear. Both units were released for outgate.

The incident resulted in 1 55-gallon poly drum of UN2491 ""P1-104 Ph Adjuster"" being crushed.  All 55 gallons of product were released to the inside of the trailer, the roadway, nearby soils, and eventually a nearby river.     At 1025 ET on April 082, 2017, XPO logistics retained Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) to oversee cleanup operations. ERTS dispatched H2O Environmental (H2O) to provide initial cleanup operations and to oversee all necessary corrective actions.    H2O arrived onsite at 1326 ET on April 08.  Their personnel immediately set up a containment perimeter with absorbent boom.  The heavily impacted soils were excavated on that date.  Additionally, 15000 gallons of water was vacuumed from the impacted river.  All impacted materials were overpacked and taken offsite for pending disposal.    H2O returned to the site on April 25 to complete corrective actions.  On that date, all remaining impacted soil (estimated 50 tons) were removed and taken offsite for pending disposal.

Details - Lion Oil Transportation Dispatcher received a call from Lion Oil driver stating that he had just spilled, in his estimation, approximately 50-70 gallons of gasoline while dropping (off-loading) product at the Circle K Convenience store in Terrell, TX. Dispatcher immediately called the on-call Lion Transportation Safety Manager. Upon arrival at the spill scene, The Safety Mngr. aided the Driver who had already begun to cordon off the area around the spill: the spill was all contained on concrete and was small in diameter - approximately 20 ft. X 50 ft. The cargo tank is supplied with several spill pads, which the driver had thrown down over the main spill area. The Driver reported the incident to CHEMTREC Rpt.# 2017-04-27-00048 at 6:45am, and the store manager called the local Fire Dept. who responded, saw that the spill was contained and left the scene. TAS Environmental responded at approximately 0900 and cleaned up the spill by 0930.  Apparently, the Driver had not taken a depth measurement (called ""sticking"") of the receiving tank at the Circle K store; there is also an electronic device (Veeder) inside the store that is used to monitor tank volume. The driver also failed to correspond the tank depth with the Veeder reading, and estimated the amount that the receiving tank could hold, which resulted in overfilling the receiving tank. Findings:  > Driver is a short time employee; Unloading procedures not followed.  > Driver was not concentrating on work due to family issues on his mind.   > Driver failed to call dispatch when he got the initial veeder reading indicating that 90 % ullage/outage had already been reached which was not enough room to receive the remainder of the cargo tank contents.  > Driver did not take a ""stick""/depth reading of tank prior to unloading.  > Driver used compartment 4 to ""top off"" the store tank which would have been only a partial load; Drivers are to drop entire compartment or none at all .This is a violation of company procedures.","> Driver was reprimanded for not following operational procedures and company policy.  > Driver will receive additional training and testing regarding loading and off-  loading procedures at retail outlets.  > Driver was reminded that his safety and the safety of others requires him to keep his mind on his work at all times while on the job.  > This incident was distributed and reviewed with all Lion Oil/Delek US Drivers at the last quarterly safety meeting.  > Lion Oil Transportation Safety Management will add this type of event to our Key Performance Indicators as a ""lagging"" metric to determine where improvements can be made to the process/procedures.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3598,Delek US Inc.,US,

The outlet valves for this cargo tank motor vehicle were removed and sent out for testing and found to have no defect, and we were unable to verify if any foreign object(s) prevented the valves from closing completely.    We have concluded that during loading of the material into the CTMV, a human error allowed some of the material to fill the space between in the internal and external outlet valves.  This material was initially intended for delivery to a different destination, but was not accepted, and routed to an alternate destination after being held in transportation for several days.       During the trip to deliver the material to the new destination, the vehicle was stopped for inspection by the Ohio State Highway Patrol.  During inspection it was noted that material began leaking from the outlet cap.  The driver assisted in spill response procedures and also vented the dome lid on the CTMV noting that a substantial amount of pressure was released through the dome lid once it was opened.  Once pressure was released, the leak from the valve appeared to stop.  Maintenance personnel dispatched to evaluate the issue and take initial corrective action determined that replacing the gasket in the outlet cap was sufficient to ensure no release of the material would occur.    The vehicle returned to operation and delivered the material to its destination roughly an additional 20 miles without further release.    Roughly 0.5 gallons of material was collected in the cleanup effort over the course of the 4 hours that elapsed between the commencement of the inspection at 08:05 and 12:00 when transportation continued to the destination.    It was determined that the most likely cause of the leak from the external valve was gasoline vapor pressure buildup between the internal and external valve, as material was trapped between the two valves.  The gasket on the outlet cap also failed to hold the material leaking from the external valve.","The terminal that manages this transportation is re-training drivers on the importance of the proper management of valves on their vehicles during loading and unloading operations.  Additionally, drivers will be trained to inspect the valve outlet prior to loading to ensure no foreign object(s) are present that could affect a valve's ability to close properly.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"EQ Industrial Services, Inc.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the staging operation, it was discovered that approximately 2 drips of material had escaped from a container. The container was inspected and noted one of the bolts on the container had loosened during transport.  All bolts were inspected and all bolts were tightened down and no further drips were noted. As an additional measure the trailer from which it was offloaded was inspected and no staining was found from the article.  The large switch was then placed in a poly containment pan and strapped down with metal strapping in two different directions to ensure the container would not tip during transit.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of loose bolts or leaking was observed. Drivers will continue to inspect each container during staging period as well as before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity.   Generator and Shipper are to ensure container closures are tightened down to specs.  Additionally ensure that all markings are in place and that the container has secondary containment and secured so that tipping of the container in-transit will be avoided.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc",US,

The tank car was isolated and the shipper Louis Dreyfus Company,  was notified via Chemtrec, report # 2017-04-29-00120. Hepaco, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the Terminal and found a slow active release from the Bread Box area on top of the tank car. After further inspection the release was found to be from the liquid line valve. It was improperly secured at the base of the valve onto the flange at the pressure plate. The securement nuts on the flange were found less than tool tight and allowing the valve to move from side to side. The flange gasket was inspected and found to be in good condition. The securement nuts were then properly tightened and the valve was properly secured to the flange. The shipper Representative Kevin Sharp with Louis Dreyfus Company (515) 230-8499 was informed of the situation found and the need for OTMA.    To date the tank car is awaiting final FRA One Time Movement Approval to complete the movement to the consignee for offloading and requalification.

During loading the drums were examined in order to make a reasonable determination that the drums had been closed properly.  No defects were noted at the time of loading.  Driver arrived at customer B’s location (site of incident) in order to load additional drums.  Customer A’s drums were required to be segregated from drums being loaded from customer B, and the driver began moving customer A’s drums from their secured position to another location on the vehicle in order to achieve proper segregation.  Driver was using a drum cart with a spring loaded device that held the drum onto the cart, and while moving a drum of customer A’s, the spring failed resulting in the drum falling from the cart.  When the drum struck floor of the vehicle, the bung closure popped out and the drum began to leak the hazardous material contained within.  The bung closure was approximately 2-2.25 inches in diameter.  When the bung closure popped off, the driver sought assistance and proper personal protective equipment in order to safely respond.  From the point of the bung closure popping out to the point the drum was situated to halt the release, roughly 20 gallons of the material was released.  The released material was cleaned up, properly packaged, and transported from the site for disposal.",The terminal operation determined that an additional root cause directly under their control was the defective drum cart used to handle the drum.

REF TRUCKING, INC. WAS FUELING A LARGE FLEET OF LOWELL SCHOOL BUSES ON A PARKING LOT ADJACENT TO THE PAWTUCKET CANAL IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE FUELER HAD COMPLETED FUELING A NUMBER OF BUSES AND THE FUEL HOSE WAS SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET AWAY FROM THE FUEL TRUCK. AS THE FUELER WAS ROLLING UP THE HOSE HE DETECTED THE SPILL AND REACTED IMMEDIATELY BY SHUTTING OFF THE FUEL AND CALLING HIS SUPERVISOR IMMEDIATELY, AS INSTRUCTED. A DEFECTIVE COUPLING ON THE HOSE HAD RUPTURED DURING REFUELING, SEPARATING FROM THE HOUSING AND RELEASING DIESEL FUEL TO THE GROUND WHERE IT SPILLED TO THE CANAL. ACCORDING TO REF TRUCKING, INC., THE HOSE WAS NEW, HAVING BEEN REPLACED TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE RELEASE. THE CRIMP ON THE HOSE COUPLING CAME OUT OF THE COUPLING DUE TO ITS DEFECT. THE MANUFACTURER, LW TANK WHICH INSTALLED THE HOSE ON MARCH 30, 2017 CAME ON-SITE TO INSPECT THE HOSE ON APRIL 12, 2017 AND ADMITTED VERBALLY THAT THE COUPLING WAS DEFECTIVE. THE DISCHARGE WAS REPORTED TO THE LOWELL FIRE DEPARTMENT WHICH, IN TURN, NOTIFIED TO THE MASSDEP AT 7:25 P.M. ON APRIL 11, 2017.   AS RESULT OF THE DEFECTIVE COUPLING, THE DIESEL FUEL ENTERED THE PAWTUCKET CANAL IN LOWELL TRAVELING ALONG THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT AND DOWN THE CANAL WALL.   BASED UPON CALCULATIONS, REF ESTIMATED A RELEASE OF APPROXIMATELY 700 GALLONS OF ON-ROAD DIESEL FUEL ENTERED THE PAWTUCKET CANAL. TWO (2) BOOMS WERE PRESENT IN THE CANAL AT THE TIME FROM OTHER LANDOWNERS. ONE BOOM WAS 400 FEET UPSTREAM OF THE SPILL AND ON THE OTHER SIDE (NORTH) OF THE CANAL AND HAD LITTLE EFFECT. A SECOND SOFT, ABSORBENT BOOM WAS LOCATED 70 FEET BELOW THE SPILL ON THE NORTH SIDE EXTENDING ON THE OTHER HALF OF THE CANAL. THE BOOM DIRECTED PRODUCT ALONG THE RIGHT SIDE (SOUTH). APPROXIMATELY 680 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL WAS RECOVERED FROM THE CANAL. MATERIAL SPILLED: ON-ROAD DIESEL FUEL.   SPILLED DIESEL FUEL WAS RELEASED FROM THE DEFECTIVE CRIMP TO THE COUPLING ON THE HOSE TO THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT AND FLOWED ACROSS THE PAVED PARKING LOT, ACROSS THE TOP OF THE CANAL WALL, DOWN THE SIDE OF THE GRANITE BLOCK CANAL WALL AND INTO THE CANAL. WATER IN THE CANAL WAS FLOWING IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION.   DIESEL FUEL WAS RECOVERED AT TWO LOCATIONS DOWNSTREAM TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR SHEEN, 50 PAYNE STREET AND 556 DUTTON STREET AT THE DUNKIN DONUTS. A PETROLEUM SHEEN WAS NOTED AT A FORK IN THE CANAL, DOWNSTREAM OF THE DUNKIN DONUTS. THIS SHEEN WAS REMEDIED WITH AN ADDITIONAL HARBOR BOOM DEPLOYED DOWNSTREAM. THE LINEAR EXTENT OF THE SHEEN IMPACTS WAS APPROXIMATELY 3,000 FEET. ADDITIONAL ABSORBENT BOOMS WERE DEPLOYED EFFECTIVELY FURTHER DOWNSTREAM OF THE FORK, NEAR MERRIMACK STREET, AS A PRECAUTION AND TO CONTAIN THE SPILL. (SEE MASSDEP REPORTS.
