AS THE LOADED ROLL-OFF BOX WAS BEING HOISTED ONTO THE TRAILER, THE LADING SHIFTED AND APPROXIMATELY TWO (2) CUBIC YARDS OF IT PASSED OVER THE BOX'S GASKETED TAILGATE AND UNDER THE PORTION OF THE TARP CONTACTING THE TAILGATE.  THE SPILLED MATERIAL FELL ONTO THE PAVED LOADING AREA, AND IT WAS PROMPTLY CLEANED UP.  THE SPILL WAS NOT THE RESULT OF A PACKAGE FAILURE; RATHER IT RESULTED FROM THE CONSIGNOR'S IMPROPER LOADING OF A STRUCTURALLY SOUND PACKAGE.  THE PAVED PARKING AREA PREVENTED THE SPILL'S CONTACT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT.  NO INJURIES OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTED FROM THE INCIDENT. ENVIRITE CORPORATION BELIEVES THAT THE SPILL IS THE RESULT OF TWO FACTORS: 1) THE ROLL-OFF BOX WAS OVERFILLED BY THE SHIPPER, AND 2) THE ROLL-OFF BOX'S LADING WAS TOO WET.  ACCORDING TO THE CONTRACT CARRIER (ANKER TRUCKING), THE DRIVER VISUALLY CHECKED THE PHYSICAL STATE OF THE LOAD AND CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS SUITABLE FOR TRANSPORT.  APPARENTLY, THE LADING'S LIQUID PORTION WAS NOT READILY OBSERVABLE. THE LOAD REMAINED AT THE SHIPPER'S SITE AND, THEREFORE, DID NOT BECOME THE SUBJECT OF ACTIVE SHIPPING PAPERS ON JULY 31, 1991.

I CHECKED HIS HOSE CONNECTIONS FOR ANY LEAKS.  THERE WERE NONE.  I SHOWED HIM WHERE OUR SHOWER AND EYE WASH STATION WAS.  HE KNEW ALREADY WHERE THEY WERE.  HE WAS WEARING RUBBER GLOVES, A LONG PROTECTIVE JACKET AND A HELMET WITH A SAFETY SHIELD.  I THEN LEFT HIM AND WENT BACK INTO THE PLANT.  I BRIEFLY SPOKE TO HIM TWICE AFTER THAT.  ONCE OUT BY HIS TRUCK AND ONCE INSIDE THE PLANT BEFORE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.  APPROXIMATELY AT 7:40 PM I HEARD A YELL, I LOOKED OUT OF THE SHIPPING OFFICE WINDOW AND SAW NO ONE AROUND. APPROXIMATELY 15-30 SECS LATER THE DRIVER COME RUNNING INTO THE BUILDING YELLING THAT HIS SKIN WAS BURNING.  HE WAS DISROBED ALREADY.  ALL HE HAD ON WAS HIS UNDERWEAR.  I RAN HIM UPSTAIRS TO OUR LOCKER ROOM AND TURNED THE SHOWER ON HIM.  I THEN RAN BACK DOWNSTAIRS AND TOLD JESSE YATCKOSKI TO GO UP THERE AND STAY WITH HIM.  I ALSO INSTRUCTED LARRY EDEN TO TAKE SOME EYE AND SKIN NEUTRALIZER UP THERE.  I THEN CALLED 911 FOR AN AMBULANCE. AFTER CALLING IT IN I WENT BACK UP THERE TO ASSIST HIM.  HE THEN TOLD ME THAT A VALVE WAS STILL OPEN ON THE TRUCK.  I RAN DOWN TO THE TRUCK TO CLOSE THE VALVE.  I TRIED CLOSING WHICH APPEARED TO BE THE MAIN VALVE BUT IT FELT TO BE MOSTLY CLOSED ALREADY.  I THEN RAN BACK UP STAIRS AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE SHUT OFF VALVE WAS AND HE TOLD ME.  I THEN RAN BACK DOWN STAIRS OUT TO THE TRUCK, CLOSED THE VALVE AND SHUT OFF THE AIR.  THE FLOW OF SULFURIC ACID FROM THE TRUCK WAS LIKE A GARDEN HOSE TURNED WIDE OPEN. APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES HAD ELAPSED FROM THE TIME I TOOK THE DRIVER UPSTAIRS TO THE SHOWER TO WHEN I HAD CLOSED THE VALVE ON THE TRUCK AND STOPPED THE FLOW.  THE ACID SPILL WENT IN TWO DIRECTIONS.  SOME MADE IT TO THE STORM SEWER AND SOME DRAINED INTO OUR WASTE TREATMENT CONTAINMENT AREA.  THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT WENT OUT TO THE STORM SEWER I WOULD GUESS APPROXIMATELY 50 TO 100 GALLONS.
