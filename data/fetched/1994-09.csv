COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS NOTIFIED BY DANNY NORMAN, RAMP FOREMAN, ITS INTERMODAL FACILITY, THAT A CONTAINER WAS REPORTED LEAKING ALONG DROTT TRACK #5 BY AN OUTSIDE DRIVER WHO WAS TO PICK UP THE CONTAINER FOR DELIVERY. MANAGER COOPER DROVED TO THE UNION PACIFIC INTERMODAL FACILITY AND OBSERVED SEVERAL SMALL DARK LIQUID DRIPS ON THE PAVEMENT BELOW THE UNDER CARRIAGE OF THE CONTAINER, WHERE LIQUID FROM THE CONTENTS HAD WORKED IT'S WAY THROUGH THE WOOD FLOORING OF THE CONTAINER. THE CONTAINER WAS OPENED TO INSPECT THE CONTENTS AND DEVELOP THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK. THE LADING CONSISTED OF 55 GALLON DRUMS, DOUBLE STACKED, AND SECURED AT THE DOORS WITH A SINGLE 2X4, WHICH IS NOT ADEQUATE BLOCKING OR BRACING. DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK WITHIN THE CONTAINER, AND NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE AREA, THE CONTAINER WAS MOVED TO STORAGE LOT #16 AND ISOLATED PENDING CONTACT WITH THE SHIPPER. MANAGER COOPER CONTACTED RAILBRIDGE, IN COLUMBUS, HOWEVER, WAS ONLY ABLE TO LEAVE A MESSAGE ON AN OFFICE RECORDER. CONTACT WAS MADE WITH K-LINE IN NEWPORT BEACH AND WAS ADVISED THEY WOULD CONTACT THE SHIPPER AND ARRANGE FOR INSPECTION. MANAGER COOPER WAS TO MEET A MARINE SURVEYOR FOR K-LINE THE FOLLOWING MORNING, HOWEVER, THE SURVEYOR AND A CONTRACTOR FOR THE SHIPPER SHOWED UP AT 2000 HOURS THE DATE OF THE INCIDENT TO INSPECT THE CONTENTS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MANAGER COOPER. WHILE WAITING FOR THE SURVEYOR TO ARRIVE THE FOLLOWING MORNING, MANAGER COOPER FOUND A CREW FROM UNITED PUMPING SERVICE, CLEAN UP CONTRACTOR FOR THE SHIPPER, WORKING ON THE LEAKING CONTAINER. THEY HAD BEEN CONTACTED BY VLADEK MARCINKOWSKI, MARINE SURVEYOR, WHO WAS UNDER CONTRACT FOR K-LINE, TO ASSESS THE LADING. MR. MARCINKOWSKI AND ART CASTELLANOS, FIELD SUPERVISOR, UNITED PUMPING SERVICE, HAD BEEN IN THE RAILYARD THE PREVIOUS EVENING TO EVALUATE THE LOAD. THE PARENT COMPANY FOR BAERLOCHER USA IS ICC INDUSTRIES, NEW YORK, WHO NEGOTIATED THE REMEDIATION CONTRACT WITH UNITED PUMPING SERVICES. MANAGER COOPER REQUESTED A MSDS ON THE LADING FROM BAERLOCHER, AND UPON RECEIVING A FAX COPY MIDMORNING, FRIDAY, ALSO PRESENTED A COPY TO A CONTRACTOR, WHO WAS WORKING THE LOAD WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE HAZARD COMMUNICATIONS. MIDPOINT INTO THE CONTAINER, A SINGLE 55 GALLON DRUM LOCATED ON THE LOWER STACK, WAS FOUND WITH THE BOTTOM ROLLING HOOP RUBBED THROUGH. DUE TO THE UNUSUAL CONDITION OF THE REMAINING DRUMS, IT WAS DECIDED TO COMPLETELY OFF LOAD THE ENTIRE CONTENTS. THE CONTRACTOR HAD PLANNED TO OVERPACK THE DAMAGED LEAKING DRUM AND PLACED IT BACK INTO THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER FOR CONTINUATION ONTO THE HARBOR. DUE TO THE LIQUID SATURATING INTO THE WOOD FLOORING OF THE CONTAINER, MANAGER COOPER ADVISED THE CONTRACTOR THAT THE CONTAINER WOULD HAVE TO BE SET ASIDE UNTIL K-LINE ASSESSED THE SITUATION AND MADE A DECISION AS TO REPLACED THE FLOORING OR HAVE THE CONTAINER DESTROYED.
