When the driver was setting up to make the gravity drop to the customer’s underground storage tank (UST), the driver did not follow LTI unloading procedures. The driver failed to follow procedure by not properly securing the drop hose/fitting to the UST fill port. After the driver started dropping product, the driver was not paying attention to the point of discharge. The hose fitting separated from the fill port allowing gasoline to be released onto the surface. Once the driver realized a product spill was taking place, the flow of product was shut off. However, by that time approximately 165 gallons of gasoline was released. Most of the spill entered a storm drain on Donaldson Hwy and discharged into a small creek several hundred feet. LTI was notified of the spill right away. LTI then proceeding to make all required regulatory notifications and contacted our hazardous material spill contractor to clean-up the spill. Most of the product was recovered by the next day by flushing 1000 gallons of water through the storm drain and recovering it at the discharge point. Spill absorbent materials were left in the creek to catch any product still left behind during rain events. The site was monitored until no more signs of gasoline were show. The clean-up was completed on July 21, 2020.","Lykins Transportation, Inc. (LTI) reviews all incidents, in order, to determine the roof cause, preventability, and what actions, i.e. training and/or procedures, need to be conducted or implemented so that the incident will not happen again. The product spill was caused by the driver not following unloading procedures and not being attentive to the point of discharge. LTI conducted a safety handout sheet for the month of July that discussed some proper hose handling techniques. Also, LTI will review the incident at the next round of driver lead safety meetings and stress the importance of following unloading procedures.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,14401,LYKINS TRANSPORTATION INC,US,

A tank car certified mobile crew was then sent in to remove the valve and replace it with a new non-defective valve and plug.

The containers were offered for transport and were packaged by the original offeror.  Heritage Transport, LLC was providing transportation services for the containers that were packaged by the original.  The driver stopped for a break at the Boomland Truck Stop at 100 Beasley Park Road in Bertrand, Missouri and at 12:07 CDT went on off-duty status.  Upon returning from his break the driver observed that fire, hazmat, and police response teams the Charleston, Missouri Department of Public Safety were actively engaged in extinguishing the fire that engulfed the 53-foot cargo van.  According to the Charleston Department of Public Safety report, dispatch occurred at 12:24 CDT with arrival of first responders at 12:40 CDT.  After communicating with the response authorities, the driver notified his dispatcher to initiate emergency response and clean-up efforts.  The incident was reported by the fire department to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) at 13:05 CDT.  Upon learning of the incident, Heritage Transport, LLC representatives notified the National Response Center 13:57 CDT.  The MDNR was notified after the NRC notification of the incident at 14:22 CDT. The vehicle was parked on concrete pavement and fire water runoff was isolated/impounded in a nearby storm water drainage ditch using sand and soil to retain fire water runoff.  After the fire was extinguished and fire department representatives finished (approximately 15:20 CDT), emergency response efforts were initiated by Heritage Environmental Services, LLC response teams starting late in the afternoon of July 20, 2020.  An emergency coordinator arrived at 17:00 CDT from St. Louis.  An inventory of containers was performed (14 of the 45 containers on the vehicle were not consumed by the fire), containers not destroyed in the fire were placed in salvage containers for transport to the designated destination facility for processing.  After responding to the immediate emergency, response and clean-up efforts were initiated and the following actions were performed between July 20 and July 24, 2020: • Vacuum trucks removed fire water run-off from the impounded drainage ditch. Fire water runoff in the impounded ditch was transported to a treatment, storage, and disposal facility for management. • The trailer was completely destroyed and the remaining shell was dismantled, sized, placed in roll-off containers, and transported to a treatment, storage and disposal facility for management. • The concrete parking lot was decontaminated by pressure washing the affected area.  Decontamination water was collected and transported to a treatment, storage and disposal facility for management. • Potentially impacted soil was removed from the impounded drainage ditch, placed in a roll-off box and transported to a t","Heritage Transport, LLC reviewed the packaging information for the disclosed contents, securement, segregation, and placarding as part of the review process and was determined to be in conformance with relevant DOT requirements.

Due to the increased pressurization, tank car contents(sulfuric acid) were vented out of the top liquid line and traveled down the side of the car, causing material to drip onto the ballast at a rate of approximately one drip per second for an estimated duration of 2 hours. The release of sulfuric acid ceased at the onset of sunset with cooling temperatures. The National Response Center(NRC) and New Mexico Environment Department(NMED) was notified of the release at approximately 01:57 on July 10, 2020 and NRC Incident Number , 1281521 was assigned. Following the call to NRC, AZER personnel contacted TRC and GrayMar Environmental Inc.(GrayMar) to respond to assist in tank car repair and cleanup activities. GrayMar utilized sorbent pads to absorb free sulfuric acid around the liquid line and water to clean residual sulfuric acid on tank car. Plastic sheeting was utilized under car to catch wash water from decontamination, which was collected for disposal. Released material to the ballast and track was neutralized and diluted using soda ash and water. pH strips were used to demonstrate that release acid had been neutralized. It was reported to the NRC that approximately 20 gallons of sulfuric acid were released from the 13,933 gallon tank car; however, upon completion of work the estimate is revised to 5 gallons. No waterways or environmentally sensitive areas were impacted; the release was limited to the track and ballast surface.",The customer Freeport McMoran Inc.(FMI) will be contacting the shipper directly to describe tank car failure mechanism to ensure components are in proper working order for future shipments.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10500,"ARIZONA EASTERN RAILWAY, 5903 B",US,

Driver was instructed to move the tank from customer site to Clean Harbors facility in West Sacramento,  which is approximately ten miles away.  Driver completed his post-trip inspection, secured the tank and left the terminal.  The following morning , it was observed the cap had corroded away.   During the investigation, it was learned the cap was aluminum.  The correct cap should have been a  stainless steel cap.  The cap was incompatible for the product. The spill was immediately reported to CA Office of Environmental Services.  Control Number is 20-3713.",Investigation concluded the wrong caps were on the tank when it arrived on customer site.

While on site, Veolia employees packed ten to twelve 4-liter plastic bottles containing 59% nitric acid, 9-10% hydrofluoric acid, 30% water and 1-2% citric acid into eleven 30-gallon plastic open head drums. The 4-liter bottles were surrounded with vermiculite within the 30-gallon outer containers. The 4-liter containers were extremely brittle from years of storage and degradation at the warehouse location where they were being stored by the customer. During vehicle loading operations, seven of the 30-gallon drums started to smoke due to a reaction of the leaking acid/etchant being mixed with the vermiculite. It is assumed that the inner containers were so brittle that moving the 30-gallon outer drums into the Veolia vehicle caused the inner containers to crack and release acid/etchant into the vermiculite resulting in an orange cloud being formed.  There was no release of the acid mixture to the outside of the 30 gallon drums. The Veolia project manager notified Veolia EH&S and a plan was developed to slow the reaction using a PPE level A response crew, time and a refrigerated truck to overpack and cool the reacting containers. The 55 gallon drums were fitted with vented bungs in case the refrigerated vehicle did not slow/stop the reaction. Over time, the reaction stopped and the drums were safety transported to the disposal facility without further incident.","Veolia reviewed this incident with the employees in the district.  Veolia EH&S also discussed the incident  with all Veolia EH&S employees on a national level to spread awareness. One of the key points was to  assure that inner packages that are old should be evaluated for safe handling, transport and disposal.  One idea was that if a similar situation is encountered that the individual bottles should be packed into pails in case they leak. Another suggestion was for the company offering the material for disposal  improve their chemical inventory system to help ensure that containers of chemicals do not become so  old that they get to the point of degrading the container.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

As a result of the damage, approximately fifty(50) gallons of product released to the trailer interior and concrete surface. RLC retained Cura Emergency Services, LC (CES) to manage the cleanup. CES dispatched a crew from TAS Environmental Services(TAS) to initiate corrective actions. TAS personnel donned the appropriate personal protective equipment(PPE), to include respirators, before making entry into the RLC trailer. Following a full assessment of the release, TAS observed approximately fifty(50) gallons of resin solution released to the trailer interior and concrete surface. The crew deployed granular absorbents to the impacted surfaces and swept them in with hand tools, then utilized rags to wipe all affected cargo in the unit's trailer. All spent absorbents were collected and containerized into two(2) 55-gallon drums for transport and disposal. TAS then pressure washed the remediated surfaces and collected all rinsate into one(1) 55-gallon drum with a drum vacuum.
