They said product was running down the sides of the car.  They found a nearby empty spike bucket and they put under the car to contain the leak.  I immediately called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington, PA to respond.  I met them on scene and after investigation, we found that the Liquid valve was leaking from the threads at the base of the valve. We wiped down the threads to make sure that it wasn't just product spilled in the housing from loading of the car.  Once the threads were cleaned, more product started coming from the threads.  We put a wrench on the valve to see if it was loose and we were able to get one half turn out of the valve tightening it further. The leak then stopped.  We tried to remove the plug from the vapor valve to relieve pressure from the car so that we could take the liquid valve off and reseal the threads but we could not get the plug out of the valve without fear of breaking off the valve itself. We then wiped down the sides of the car so it could continue in transportation.",I am not sure that this problem could have been detected prior to shipment.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1500,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

The valves in the protective housing were found to be closed but the plug in the liquid line was loose by 3 turns and the vent valve was loose by 4 turns.  The loose valves were tightened. With all closures secure, the side of the car was decontaminated.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

Upon arrival, the contractor found GATX 38058, a loaded CO2 car, to be leaking from the protective housing.  Air monitoring was performed throughout the night. The point of release was determined to be the rupture disk. The release stabilized shortly after when balance of liquid CO2 auto-refrigerated to a solid dry ice. The car has been isolated and spotted and is awaiting replacement of the rupture disc next week.      File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.

Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

THE TRACTOR ENCOUNTERED A SIGNIFICANT STOPPING FORCE WHEN IT CAME INTO CONTACT WITH OTHER SPRUCE TREES GROWING NEARBY.  THE CAB OF THE TRACTOR WAS PARTIALLY CRUSHED AS A RESULT.  BEFORE COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP, THE FRONT OF THE TRACTOR CRASHED IN TO THE REAR PORTION OF THE BOATHOUSE, COLLAPSING TWO OF THE FOUR WALLS AND DAMAGING THE ROOF.  THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER DID NOT SEPARATE AFTER COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP, FORTY YARDS FROM WHERE IT HAD LEFT THE ROADWAY, AND TWENTY YARDS FROM THE EDGE OF THE OHIO RIVER.    THE PROPERTY OWNER WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO ARRIVE ON-SCENE, WHILE IT IS BELIEVED OTHER RESIDENTS NEARBY PLACED A CALL TO 911.  THE PROPERTY OWNER WAS INSPECTING THE DAMAGES DONE WHEN HE NOTICED THE DRIVER WALKING AROUND THE UNIT.  THE DRIVER HAD SUFFERED AN UNDETERMINED HEAD INJURY AND WAS BLEEDING.  THE PROPERTY OWNER THEN CALLED 911 AND STAYED WITH THE DRIVER.  PARAMEDICS ARRIVED ON-SCENE TO BEGIN TREATING THE DRIVER.  THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO PLACE A CALL TO LYKINS DISPATCH IN ORDER TO ALERT THE COMPANY RESPONDERS BEFORE HE WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL.  COMPANY PERSONNEL RESPONDED WITH REPORTING TO THE OHIO EPA (INCIDENT #508-56-1667), THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (REPORT#1124700), THE MONROE COUNTY EMA, AND THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT.  MONROE COUNTY EMA HAD ESTABLISHED CONTACT WITH MOUNTAIN STATE ENVIRONMENTAL FOR REMEDIATION AND ASSISTANCE.  THE ROADWAY WAS TAKEN DOWN TO ONE LANE FOR A MAJORITY OF THE DAY, WITH ONLY APPROXIMATELY FIVE TO SIX HOURS WHEREBY THE ROAD WAS SHUT DOWN.    THE TRACTOR AND TRAILER WERE ALMOST COMPLETELY UPSIDE-DOWN WHEN THE UNIT CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP, BUT THE TRAILER WAS STILL AT AN ANGLE.   THE PRODUCT IN THE TRAILER COULD NOT BE RECOVERED THROUGH THE LOAD HEADS, AND SO THE DECISION TO DRILL INTO THE BARREL WAS CONCLUDED TO BE THE BEST POSSIBLE COURSE OF ACTION TO EMPTYING THE TRAILER PRIOR TO RIGHTING THE UNIT.  FORTUNATELY, THE ALUMINUM BARREL HAD REMAINED MOSTLY INTACT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE REAR TOP-RAILS HAVING BEEN IMPALED BY ONE OF THE GUARD RAIL SEGMENTS.  NO PRODUCT APPEARED TO HAVE ESCAPED THROUGH THAT SECTION OF THE BARREL.  AFTER EMERGENCY RESPONDERS SECURED THE SITE AND DEMOLISHED THE REMAINS OF THE BOATHOUSE, A COMPANY MECHANIC WAS DEPLOYED TO DRIL","FROM BOTH AN OPERATIONAL AND SAFETY PERSPECTIVE, LYKINS TRANSPORATION, INC;  DOES HOLD QUARTERLY SAFETY MEETINGS WITH OUR DRIVERS IN ORDER TO REVIEW A VARIETY OF DRIVING AND ROADWAY CONCERNS WITH OUR LINE OF BUSINESS.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the storage phase of the operation, plant personnel inspects the trailers as part of their everyday activities.  During this type of inspection, it was discovered a few drops of black liquid near the front of the van trailer.  Absorbent material was applied to the spilled material.  A decision was made to move the trailer to the loading dock (which was lined with 6 mil poly) so as to be placed in containment area.   Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised  container into a suitable salvage drum. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and  placed into the salvage drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.  In house Field Services group was notified and dispatched to the plant. It was noted that a stacked pallet of 4 drums on top of the drums most likely resulted in the compromising of the seam on the two drums that leaked.  All absorbent and spill debris was placed in the over pack drum and secured for shipment to the designated treatment facility.","At the time the containers were accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the transfer operation, it was discovered that approximately 3 gallons of material had  escaped from a pinhole leak that had developed in a container. While accessing the compromised package, it was discovered a tote had been punctured by the corner of a light fixture, which was next to the tote while in transit.  Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place liquid from the compromised container into suitable drums. The bladder of the tote was placed in a flex-bin.  The light fixtures were placed in a flex-bin. In addition, the under carriage of the trailer and the floor of the trailer was decontaminated. The soil beneath the trailer was dug up (about 2' down) and placed in 8 flex-bins.  All personal protective equipment, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and placed into the flex-bins. Once complete, the containers were secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.",Plant Manager's recommendations to prevent recurrence include:       Ship pcb containers direct to the end facility        Place all light fixtures in boxes to avoid corner edges from coming        into contact with adjacent packages,No,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,12000,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc",US,

The employee was not aware that the forks of the forklift were protruding approximately 2” from the back-side of the pallet he was loading and had the pallet he was loading lifted too high, so that one of the protruding forks punctured the drum behind the pallet he was loading. The hole in the drum is appx 3"" L x 1"" W on the lower-side of the drum. CHAT immediately removed the damaged drum and all other undamaged material from the container, contained the spilled gasoline in the container, then began clean-up of the spilled gasoline inside the container using absorbent (vermiculite). We wrapped the damaged empty drum in a 4 mil think plastic containment bag, placed the damaged drum in a UN certified containment salvage drum, swept up the vermiculite after it had absorbed the spilled gasoline and place it in a separate UN certified containment salvage drum, and quarantined the container in our yard to air out.     In the meantime CHAT also immediately contacted the appropriate authorities (local FAA field office, local Romulus MI Fire Department), and also the shipper (Halterman Solutions) to notify them of the situation, and also immediately filed an Incident Report with the Shipper's 24 Hour Emergency Contact Provider Service Chemtrec (Report ID No.: 2015082600116)     The Ocean Line agreed to accept the Ocean Container back into service on Sept 2 2015 after it had aired out at CHAT for 7 days since there were no gasoline fumes or damage to the floor of the container, so container was re-loaded with 79 drums and shipped from CHAT on Sept 3 2015.     CHAT of Michigan’s internal review has resulted in the employee being terminated for failure to follow company loading policies.",CHAT of Michigan immediately re-trained and re-tested the employee and all other warehouse employees on Fork Lift Safety and loading procedures the same afternoon August 26 2015.,No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3427,"CHAT of Michigan, Inc.",US,

THE TANK WAS OVERFILLED AND MATERIAL FLOWED INTO A SECONDARY CONTAINMENT STRUCTURE. A SUMP PUMP USED FOR REMOVING RAINWATER WAS LEFT IN THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT STRUCTURE AND WHEN THE FLOAT SWITCH ON THE PUMP ACTIVATED THE MATERIAL WAS PUMPED OUT OF CONTAINMENT ONTO A CONCRETE SURFACE. THE MATERIAL FLOWED NORTH THROUGH A GRAVEL LOT TO THE STORM SEWER GRATE LOCATED IN THE SE CORNER OF EDWIN ST NW AND STERLING AVE NW. A PORTION OF THE MATERIAL FLOWED WEST THROUGH THE STORM SEWER SYSTEM TO WILL AVE. NW, THEN SOUTH TO ANN ST. NW, AND WAS DISCHARGED TO INDIAN MILL CREEK. THE VOLUME OF MATERIAL RELEASED WAS DETERMINED BY MASS BALANCE (ATTACHED). ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE IS BELIEVED TO BE MINIMAL AS PH READINGS IN INDIAN MILL CREEK ~30 FEET DOWNSTREAM OF THE DISCHARGE WERE MEASURED AT 6-7 PH (PER CARRIE RIVETTE- CITY OF GRAND RAPIDS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES). HAVILAND’S HAZMAT TEAM RESPONDED, AS WELL AS THE CITY OF GRAND RAPIDS FIRE DEPARTMENT, POLICE DEPARTMENT, CITY OF GRAND RAPIDS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, AND SET ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES. MATERIAL WAS DIKED ONSITE AND COLLECTED AS WELL AS MATERIAL FROM THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT STRUCTURE. THE CITY OF GRAND RAPIDS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT INSTALLED A STORM SEWER PLUG AT THE CORNER OF ANN ST. NW AND WILL AVE. NW TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CONTAINMENT AND ALSO PROVIDED SAND BAGS FROM THE HAVILAND HAZMAT TEAM TO PROVIDE CONTAINMENT FOR THE STORM SEWER DISCHARGE. THE STORM SEWER INLET ORIGINALLY IMPACTED AND THE SAND BAGGED AREA AT THE STORM SEWER DISCHARGE WAS PUMPED. THEN WITH THE HELP OF THE GRFD A HYDRANT WAS USED TO WASH DOWN THE SPILL AREA TO THE STORM SEWER. A VACUUM TRUCK WAS STATIONED AT THE STORM SEWER PLUG TO CAPTURE ALL OF THE WASH DOWN WATER. THE VOLUME OF WASH WATER FOR EACH FLUSH WAS LIMITED TO 1500 GALLONS TO ENSURE CAPACITY IN THE VACUUM TRUCK. THE STORM SEWER WAS FLUSHED TWICE WITH WATER, AND TWO MORE TIMES WITH WATER AND 40 GALLONS OF LIQUID CITRIC ACID (EACH TIME) TO NEUTRALIZE ANY RESIDUAL SODIUM HYDROXIDE IN THE STORM SEWER AFTER THE FOURTH FLUSH THE PH IN THE STORM SEWER WAS MEASURED AT 5.5. THE STORM SEWER PLUG WAS THEN REMOVED. THE NEXT MORNING, 08/12/2015 AT 7:25 AM, THE WATER AT THE STORM WATER DISCHARGE WAS MEASURED AGAIN AND SHOWED IT TO BE 7.5. THE SAND BAGS WERE REMOVED FROM INDIAN MILL CREEK AT 05:1 AM THAT MORNING AND TREATED INTERNALLY FOR ANY RESIDUAL SODIUM HYDROXIDE. WATER AT THE STORM SEWER DISCHARGE WAS MEASURED AGAIN ON 08/13/2015 AT 10:00AM WITH A RESULT OF 8.6 PH, AND 08/14/2015 AT 4:00 PM WITH A RESULT OF 7 PH.     THERE WAS NO PACKAGE FAILURE.

The driver felt the hose from the pump to the customer fill line and it felt light.  He verified there was product reaching the petcocks / primer valves on the pump.  He shut everything down including the pump and the valves on the truck and customer fill line.  He slowly released one of the camlocks and nothing came out so then he disconnected the other.  He lifted the hose trying to ensure nothing would spill and he said it must have burped an air bubble out and then product started coming up and over the top of the hose (which seems odd).  Only thing i can venture to guess is that when he shut down the pump still had vacuum pressure on the 'draw' side and when it was able to vent it used that vacuum to push the product into the outflow side of the pump.  When product started coming up and over is when he tried to reconnect the hose to prevent further spillage and when he did product splashed out and hit him in the chest area only.  He showered immediately and advised he was fine.  I followed up with him later to verify he was still not seeing any symptoms.  The driver didnt have the right PPE on for what we require, he was missing the nomex suit and also goggles.  I don't think that would've changed the overall outcome on this as the nomex isn't a chemical suit, it is just a flame retardent covering.  We believe this started as the customer tank vent wasn't opened and therefore product couldn't flow into the tank.  When we asked the customer they said they verified it was but no one ever went back on top of the customer tank to double check.  The same question was asked several times as a matter of fact and the same answer without anyone looking.  1 -2 quarts in total spilled.",Driver should have used bleeder valve on his pump to bleed off any pressure on the line as well as any product that made it into the hose from the discharge side of his pump before disconnecting to inspect.

The employee was informed to seek medical assistance and contact us, if it worsens. ~~I then blocked off the area and notified Safety and Security. We were informed by Brian Schutte to either find an employee willing to clean the spill or contact a hazmat spill team. We were told to use gloves, goggles, and to dispose of material in a salvage drum. Also, to use stay dry to clean up the small amount on the floor of the trailer. ~~During clean up, it was noticed that portions of the gasket on the lid were inside of the tank. It appears that the gasket may have failed due to being improperly applied to the top of the tote, resulting in some of the contents being released through the lid (approx 1 cup). We have put the gasket back in place, resealed the lid, and cleaned the inside of the trailer.","Shipper needs to ensure that the gasket is in place and properly maintained to prevent further spills. Portions of the gasket were visibly not in place under the lid and protruding from the tensioned side of the lid. Driver performing pickup could also do an inspection, although it might not be as easy for him to see flaws in packaging due to the height of this container (approx 6').~~Checkers need to be aware of surroundings.

Reportedly, there was evidence of discoloration around the protective housing. The tank car was isolated. The shipper, Clearon Corp, was notified via Chemtrec, report # 2015-0829-00030. SPSI, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the Parkersburg Yard. Matt Bond, (304) 266-8287 from the Consignee Axial was contacted for local CHLOREP Team. SPSI found that the PRD was in fact releasing product and would need to be capped with a ""C"" kit as the tank car only had 129 psi. CSX contacted local FRA Hazmat Dan McCourt who alerted FRA Region 2 that an emergency move would need to take place and return the tank car to Axial Facility in Natrium, WV. CSX arranged for a special train move that would have air monitoring equipment on board and the ""C"" kit would be checked periodically to ensure the leak remained contained. Once returned to Axial the tank car would be depressurized and appropriate repairs would be made. AXLX 1456 was handed off to Axial at 17:15.
