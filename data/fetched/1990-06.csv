SPILL INCIDENT WAS THE RESULT OF A CARGO TRANSFER FROM THE TANK-TRAILER TO A 25,000 BBL STORAGE TANK.  AN IN-LINE CUSTODY TRANSFER PUMP PULLS FLUID FROM THE TRAILER THROUGH HOSE AND PIPING AND MOVES IT VIA ADDITIONAL PIPING INTO THE TANK.  PUMP RATE IS 400 BBLS PER HOUR. 2. IN THE TWO DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, LOADS TO THE TERMINAL HAD DOUBLED DUE TO INCREASED PRODUCTION AT THE TRUNKLINE PLANT.  STORAGE CAPACITY WAS STRETCHED.  DUE TO POOR COMUNICATION AT THE TERMINAL BETWEEN THE DRIVERS AND GAUGERS, FLUID LEVEL IN THE TANK WAS NOT RELATED TO THE DRIVER UNLOADING AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. 3. AS THE DRIVER NEARED COMPLETION OF UNLOADING, HE HEARD FLUID HIT THE GROUND NEXT TO THE TANK.  THE TRANSFER PUMP WAS SHUT OFF IMMEDIATELY, BUT WITH THE LARGE SURFACE AREA OF THE FLUID IN TANK, CONSIDERABLE OIL SPILLED OVER THROUGH THE HATCH AND TANK VENTS.  TWENTY-FIVE BARRELS IS JUST 3/8"" BY GAUGE IN THE TANK. 4. THE SPILL WAS CONFINED ENTIRELY INSIDE THE TANK FIREWALL DIKE. TWENTY-THREE BARRELS WAS SUCTIONED BY VACUUM TRUCK FROM THE GROUND SURFACE AND PUMPED TO AN ADJACENT TANK.  MANIFOLD VALVES WERE OPENED TO DRAIN THE FULL TANK AND EQUALIZE WITH THE ADJACENT TANK. 55. CLEAN-UP CONSISTED OF MOPING RESIDUAL OIL WITH ABSORBENT PADS. CONTAMINATED TOP SOIL WAS SHAVED TO A 2"" DEPTH AND REPLACED WITH 28 YEARDS OF FIL DIRT.  THE STORAGE TANK WAS WASHED WHERE STAINED. 6. REMEDIAL ACTION INVOLVES OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR LOGGING OF LOADS TO A CONTINUATION SHEET KEPT IN A MAILBOX NEAR THE TRANSFER PUMP.  EACH LOAD ACCOUNTS FOR 7"" OF FLUID RISE IN THE STORAGE TANK.
