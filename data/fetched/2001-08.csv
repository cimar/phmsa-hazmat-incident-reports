AN OIL ABSORBING CLAY PRODUCT WAS SPREAD ON THE SPILL SITE AND PLACED ALONG THE ROAD EDGE TO ABSORB ANY OIL BEFORE IT COULD RUN INTO THE SOIL OR THE DRAINAGE DITCH ALONG THE ROAD.. PEAT-SORB A PEAT MOSS OIL ABSORBENT WAS SPREAD OVER THE SPILL AND SWEPT BACK AND FORTH WITH PUSH BROOMS TO ABSORB THE CRUDE OIL. THE PEAT-SORB WAS THEN SWEPT UP FOR DISPOSAL. SAND WAS THEN SPREAD ON THE ROAD SURFACE WHERE THE OIL HAD SPILLED PRIOR TO OPENING THE ROAD TO ASSURE PROPER TRACTION. ALTHOUGH THE CARGO TANK WAS ONLY LOADED TO 75% OF IT'S CAPACITY, 50% OF THE LOAD WAS REMOVED AS A PRECAUTION, THE CARGO TANK WAS INSPECTED AT THE SPILL SITE BY A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INSPECTOR FROM THE OHIO HIGHWAY PATROL AND NO PROBLEMS WERE FOUND. SINCE IT WAS DARK WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS MOVED IT WAS ONLY TAKEN A SHORT DISTANCE AND PARKED OVERNIGHT. THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE CARGO TANK WAS INSPECTED BY A CERTIFIED HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CARGO TANK INSPECTOR. SINCE NO PROBLEMS WERE FOUND THE CARGO TANK WAS TAKEN TO OUR MAINTENANCE SHOP AND WAS AGAIN RE-INSPECTED AND NO PROBLEMS WERE FOUND. THIS LEAVES DRIVER ERROR AS THE ONLY REMAINING POSSIBILITY , ALTHOUGH THE ERROR COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED DURING THE POST ACCIDENT INTERVIEW WITH THE DRIVER, WE FEEL THAT THE DRIVER MUST HAVE LEFT A VALVE OPEN OR PARTIALLY OPEN BETWEEN COMPARTMENTS AFTER LOADING THE CRUDE OIL AT THE OIL  WELL PRODUCTION SITE, AS THE TRUCK WENT UP HILLS, THE LOAD WOULD SHIFT TO THE REAR COMPARTMENT CAUSING A PRESSURE INCREASE WHICH CAUSED SMALL AMOUNTS OF OIL TO BE RELEASED FROM THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE. THE OIL CONTINUED TO BUILD UP IN THE THE TROUGH ON TOP OF THE CARGO TANK UNTIL THE QUANTITY WAS ENOUGH TO RUN OUT THE TROUGH'S DRAIN TUBE. WHEN THE SPILL OCCURRED THE CARGO TANK WAS ON A INCLINE AT A STOP SIGN, THE DRIVER WAS RE-TRAINED ON THE PROPER USE OF THIS CARGO TANK. PRIOR TO THE COMPANY BEING NOTIFIED BY OUR DRIVER THE ALEXANDRIA POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD ALREADY CONTACTED THE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. SECTION OF THE OHIO E.P.A., THE LICKING COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY, THE OHIO HIGHWAY PATROL AND THE ALEXANDRIA - ST. ALBANS FIRE DEPARTMENT. AFTER THE SPILL WAS CLEANED UP EMPLOYEES CHECKED THE SITE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ROAD HAD NOT BECOME SLICK DURING THE MORNING AND AFTERNOON OF SEPTEMBER 1ST, 2ND AND 3RD, THE SITE WAS CHECKED AGAIN AROUND NOON ON SEPTEMBER 4TH AND AFTER THE NEXT RAIN, DUE TO CONCERN FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. DURING THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 4TH I CONTACTED MR. MIKE DALTON OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SECTION OF THE OHIO E.P.A. AND MR. JEFF WALKER OF THE LICKING COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH OUR RESPONSE AND CLEAN UP.
