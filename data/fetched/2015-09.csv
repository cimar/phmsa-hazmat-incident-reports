Car Inspector reported his observation to CR Trainmaster P. Delisi, who in turn contacted CR Risk Management-Hazmat A. Richter.    CR emergency response contractor Hepaco responded to investigate and remediate.  Inspection noted the shipper's seal still intact on the protective housing securement pin, which he removed to open the housing's lid.  Further inspection found both liquid valves partially frosted around the closure plugs (plug-style valves) and vapor also being emitted from the vapor valve.  Valves were not properly closed, whereby closing them stopped the leaks.  After defrosting the valves, Hepaco noted all closure plugs were not even hand tight (required to be tool tight).

KCS Environmental + Hazmat Department dispatched an emergency response contractor to investigate.  The shipper was notified and also sent a responder to the yard to assist with investigation.      The responders assessed the UTLX 930080 and found no leak or defects. They then assessed the UTLX 900549. There was very low readings of H2S in the protective housing (less than 5ppm), but nothing obvious, and non-detect readings on the ground and outside the protective housing. The fittings and valves were tested with snoop (a bubble solution) and responders located a very small, minuet, leak from the B-end Liquid Line Valve at the base plate connection. There was one loose B-end liquid valve connection nut which was tightened securing the leak (1/2 turn loose). More snoop was applied to verify that the leak had been secured.    The UTLX 900549 was returned to the shipper's plant under a one time movement approval 3 for unloading, root cause investigation, and recertification.     File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

Our truck was unable to slow down fast enough and therefore attempted to navigate onto right shoulder in an effort to avoid rear end collision. The rear axle of secondary trailer locked its breaks and caused a violent enough action to cause roll over. The roll over caused large dents on the left side of cargo tank, that will require repair.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Great Northern Midstream, LLC was notified via CHEMTREC, report 2015-09-11-00083. EP+S of Vermont, the Buffalo Branch, a CSXT emergency response contractor was dispatched to the scene, as well as CSXT Hazardous Material Systems Manager, Michael Bethge, during the investigation it was determined the liquid line valve was by-passing product, and the secondary securement TODO Quick Connect valve, by-passing product also, as the internal spring has weakened and oil is seeping by the dry-lock connection assembly.   With the issue identified, it was determined that the tank car would require a transload, as the package is not secure per 49 CFR 174.50, therefore corrective actions were taken to contain the release, these actions were communicated to the shipper, Mr. Dan Ruiz, Off: 713-800-7978.    NOTE: on the original waybill, dated 09/07/15, waybill Number 777-008569-780166, it reflected that Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) was the shipper of record, this was a computer error during entry on the part of Great Northern Midstream, LLC. It is so noted the Great Northern Midstream, LLC is taking full responsibility for this incident, and handling all recoverable costs associated with CBTX 740385 NAR incident.

When the truck pump PTO initiated there was a surge of product within the fueling hose which caused the locked open nozzle to fall out of the customer equipment fill pipe causing a release on the impervious pavement.,Driver is being retrained per Company policy that all dispensing nozzles will not be locked in the open position unless hands on and attended during any fueling operations.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Quick Fuel Fleet Services LLC,US,

I was able to get a copy of the bill of lading for the truck from the office in Midland to see what cargo was onboard. Once our operations manager was onsite, he confirmed the product was leaking from the truck. At this point, Reagan county fire and our operations manager began laying down plastic sheeting, pigs and building dikes to stem product seepage. I initiated a call to Allied International Emergency, with whom we have a contract, to begin dispatch to the site. Allied arrived on scene at 12:45 to begin cleanup shortly thereafter, it was determined that 100 gallons of WS-415 had spilled; reportable quantity for this product is 53 gallons. I arrived in Midland and began notifications to NRC, TCEQ and the local LEPC at approximately 15:45. By 18:00, Allied had completed cleanup and remediation. It was determined that the driver fell asleep while driving and failed to negotiate a turn in the roadway. We have also determined that the valve on the tank had some corrosion.",We currently have a STOP work policy in place. This has been reiterated with the emphasis out on self-awareness.

Initial reports indicated no obvious liquid or vapor release from the car, only an odor was detected. The CSX PSCC was notified, and Hazardous Materials Managers Joseph Taylor and Joseph Caccamo were notified. SUNPRO Environmental was dispatched from Canton, OH to respond and provide assistance.    Upon arrival SUNPRO was able to confirm the presence of the odor, as well as detectable levels of vapor with Photo Ionization within 1 meter of the car. It was determined the release point of the vapor was from a vacuum relief valve located in the top mounted protective housing, secured via 4 bolt flange to the pressure plate and nozzle. Initially, the vacuum relief valve was isolated with polypropylene sheeting to reduce the amount of detectable odor adjacent to the tank car, and allow for time to speak with the Shipper, Car Owner, Tank Car Builder, and Manufacturer of the identified valve.     It was determined that the parts required to stop the release, i.e. blind bolted flange or replacement valve would not be immediately available. Arrangements were made with Union Tank Car Mobile Repair Unit, in coordination with the Shipper to receive the necessary valve on 15 September 2015. The protective housing was double wrapped in polypropylene sheeting, and a deodorant was applied to contain the pungent detectable odor adjacent to the car. A monitoring team performed daily inspections of the tank car, and at 1500 hours on 15 September 2015 the defective vacuum relief valve was replaced in kind with identical Durlon 9000 gasket material. Upon replacement, no detectable odor or vapor was discovered by Photo Ionization.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CSX Transportation,US,

KCS Environmental + Hazmat Department dispatched a response contractor to investigate.  The Louisiana State Police were notified and subsequently dispatched a Trooper.  Upon arriving, air monitoring was started.  SHPX 221521, a loaded Stabilized Butadiene tank car was found to be the source of the odor.  Upon opening the protective housing, the ""B"" end liquid valve DryLok connection was found to be frozen, indicating liquid butadiene was caught in the connection.  The shipper was notified and dispatched personnel to inspect and secure the tank car.  By the time the shipper arrived, the liquid valve had defrosted  so the pressure relief device mounted on the valve body was  removed to determine whether any liquid butadiene was caught in the valve. No liquid was found and the pressure relief device was replaced.     File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

Location: West Haverstraw Marina, 600 Beach RD, W Haverstraw NY   Driver: William Givens  Vehicle: 821/4510  Weather: Clear and sunny – 83F  Injuries: None  Smoke/Fire/Private Property: None  Major Road Closure: None  Media: None  Incident Overview: Driver arrived at location to transfer diesel fuel from tank truck to above ground storage tank. Transfer was calculated without 10% safe overfill margin factored in. The driver who was in control of the transfer heard an audible change in the meter which calculates the amount transferred. This prompted the driver to cease transfer operations at which time he identified product spray from the vent pipe associated with the marina tank. Further investigation revealed that 10 gallons was discharged to the asphalt with < 3 gallons of over-spray from vent pipe to water.   Notifications:  • NRC: 1635 Hours – Report 1128012  • NYS DEC 1705 Hours – Report 1506141  Mitigation & Response: After the product transfer was terminated fuel was dispensed from the tank to a vehicle in order to reduce the fuel level within the tank. Drisol was used to contain product discharged to land and the marina provided boom to contain the over-spray in the water.  OSRO was dispatched at 1645 hours and arrived onsite at 1755 hours. Castleton Environmental will be conducting all remedial efforts and removing oil spill debris to an approved TSDF.   Investigation: Failed to determine if receiving tank can accept amount to be transferred in violation NYS environmental conservation law 613.3 resulting in release to the environment.   Disposition: In addition to violation of State law Mr. Givens also violated Company policy 0100-5 Loading & Delivery placing undue risk on the Company and causing harm to the environment based on his negligent actions. As such, Mr. Givens has been given a week suspension and is on all-inclusive final warning.

He was pushed back by pressure and covered in diesel. He had showered inside and left property to goget cleaned up more. Operations manager estimated that based on compartment size and what was pumped, about222 gallons spilled, but probably about 20 stayed on top of truck and another 25+ on ground, so less than 200 gallonsinto catch basin that leads to oil-water-separator. When I arrived onsite our operations manager and another driverhad already done quite a bit of clean-up on top of truck and on concrete pad. Call to WA EMD regarding spill since itwas in catch basin. He would notify Ecology. WA EMA Incident report #15-3620. Around 8:54pm received call backfrom Eric at NRC (clean-up supervisor), said he was getting crew together and would head down. Around 9:00pm callto National Response Center, they took report and relayed to various agencies. NRC Incident report #1127838. Wesurveyed our stormwater treatment system down stream in the catch basin system and there were no impacts, allfuel had remained contained in OWS that is just down from impacted catch basin. Around 9:12pm received call fromEPA regarding spill report they received from NRC, provided details and they were satisfied that everything wasunder control. Around 9:18pm received call from Doug Stoltz with Ecology, explained details and he was satisfied thateverything was under control also. Around 9:21 pm received call from Coast Guard, explained no waterway impacted,they were satisfied. Around 10:05pm NRC clean-up supervisor arrived, I showed him impacted areas. Productcontained to first catch basin on tank pad and oil-water-separator near tank pad, nothing appeared to go farther thanthat. We wiped down truck and put more pads down and had our dispather move the truck.Around 11:15pm the rest of the NRC clean-up crew arrived and worked to get property, catch basin and OWScleaned up.

Upon discovery of the hose disconnection the driver shut the safety valves on our tank and shut the customers pump off. He contained the spilled ULSD with oil pads and booms. After the oil was contained and cleaned he unloaded the remainder of the load safely. After unloading the rest of the product it was determined that approximately 70 gallons had been released. All 3 owners of the company were at the facility within 45 minutes of the call from the driver to evaluate the situation. We cleaned the oil with pads, booms and oil dry. J & J spill company was also notified to assist with the cleanup operation and disposed of all contaminated product. After careful evaluation of the incident we determined it was driver error and could have been prevented by assuring the hose was attached property. Our decision was to terminate the employee","We have an ongoing safety training program in place which is continuously monitored by our safety director. We hold monthly safety meetings and due to this incident we used it as a focal point for our October meeting. We discussed why this accident may have occured and how to prevent it in the future. As a group, including owners, managers and drivers, we concluded 3 main points that could have prevented this occurrence: 1. Always double checking hose connections before loading/unloading  2. Using velcro straps around the cam locks to assure the hose stays attached when pumping, especially with the pressures that are present during a pump off  3. Always checking equipment for worn or broken cam locks, hose ends, or damaged clamps, and getting them repaired/replaced. The hose in this incident was in good condition, and the driver had velcro straps in his truck, which he failed to use, therefore we do feel this incident was driver error which is why we decided to terminate the employee. Part of the October safety meeting included the drivers & managers personally going out in the yard and checking every hose and fitting to assure they have the proper equipment and it is in good condition. It was made clear that these procedures are to be done during their daily pre/post trip vehicle inspections",No,,Cargo tanks,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,15200,JAMES A TURNER INC,US,
