He then went to open the filter housing to check the filter screen because the strange sound the pump was making had previously been found to be caused by debris being caught in the filter screen. When he opened the housing lid, ethanol began flowing out of the filter housing. The yard foreman happened to be coming by the transfer site at this time and observed the situation. He immediately went and moved the valve handle to the opposite position which closed the railcar valve. The ethanol stopped flowing in approx. 15 seconds. There was approx. 25 gallons of ethanol released onto the pavement. The ethanol was immediately contained on the asphalt without any reaching any storm drains or other ground sources.

SET Environmental, Inc. investigated the trailer, and discovered two (2) leaking 330-gallon metal totes.  A combined total of approximately 10 gallons released from the two leaking totes.  Apparently the release was a result of faulty valves on the totes.  SET Environmental, Inc. applied absorbent material as needed and proceeded to transfer the product from the leaking totes into twelve (12) 55-gallon recovery drums.  The twelve (12) 55-gallon drums of product and the two empty totes were left on site pending shipper instructions.  One (1) 55-gallon drum of contaminated absorbent material was transported by SET Environmental, Inc. to their facility in Bridgeview, Illinois pending disposal coordination.

Investigation revealed that the o-ring inside the pressure relief valve was stretched out of shape and would not seal so it was replaced.,"During the cleaning process, these orings need to be inspected very carefully to assure that they are the proper type of material compatible for the product to be carried which is tough since in most cases, you have no idea what the commodity will be.      The oring from this valve was discarded before we could inspect it to identify the type of material.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Enterprise Transportation Company a division of EPCO, INC.",US,

The free product was contained within the porthole at the top of the tank, and did not impact the environment or threaten any waters of the state.  The Cecil County Emergency Services Hazmat Team was on site during inspection, and Slay Transportation Co., Inc. representatives responded to replace the loose gasket, and secure shipment, prior to proceeding.  No injuries or exposures were reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be related to a faulty gasket on the vehicle, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

During a routine inspection at the Triple Crown Services' rail yard in Granite City, Illinois, a leak was discovered inside the trailer.  Apparently, one (1) 350 gallon tote, had a cracked weld on the seam of the tote, which resulted in the release of approximately 15 gallons of free product.  Bellon Environmental Company of Saint Louis, Missouri was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, free product was detected along the asphalt surface and on the trailer floor.  Bellon Environmental Company applied floor dry to the asphalt surface and trailer floor to recover the free product.  The spent floor dry was containerized into one (1) 55-gallon drum, pending disposal.  Bellon Environmental Company proceeded to transfer the remaining product from the damaged tote into seven (7) 55 gallon drums. (6 full, 1 partial)  The virgin product and damaged tote were left at the TCS yard, pending disposition from the shipper.  One (1) 55-gallon drum of spent floor dry was transported off site, pending disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.

During the loading operation, the equipment operator became distracted and failed to cease pumping operations when the tank reached the maximum loading volume.  This resulted in the loss of vacuum to the unit which allowed approximately 40 gallons to overflow out of the top fill hole.  The equipment operator immediately shut down the loading operation and initiated the clean up of the loading area.  All spill debris was containerized and was placed into storage pending off-site disposal.  In addition, the tank was cleaned and all residues were removed from the exterior surface of the tank.  Please note that an inspection of the vehicle indicated that the tank was in working order and the cause was directly attributed to operator error.","In order to prevent a recurrence, the driver of the unit in question has been re-instructed on the attendance requirements when loading or unloading a cargo tank and the absolute necessity to be in direct control of the loading operation at all times.

The shipper utilized the ORM-D classification in offering the material for transport and fully disclosed all known hazards of this material. This material was a recalled consumer product to be utilized as a treatment chemical at PSC’s TSDF in Fernley NV. The MSDS for this material was reviewed to initially determine the classification and handling of this material. PSC decided to take further precautionary measures by temporarily storing the material in a covered isolated area. After storage for approx 4 months at the PSC-Nortru Transfer Facility (Detroit) the material was relocated to another isolated area of the facility in preparation for final shipment to Fernley NV. The material ignited approx. 4 hours after it was relocated on 08.01.2008. It was noted that the material was exposed to direct sunlight on this day. A CPSC advisory released on April 03, 2008 fully disclosed the nature of this recalled product and its potential instability. 911 was called for response action. The fire was observed from a safe distance while portable fire extinguishers were on standby to minimize the risk of spreading. The fire department remained off-site and diverted traffic away from the facility entrance on Freud St. When the fire subsided (approx 45 minutes), employees doused the area with water to completely extinguish the flame and cool the residue pile (consumed material + pallets + packaging). Clean-up activities will include fire residue removal, fire fighting water removal and decontamination of the concrete containment area. No one experienced any ill health effects. 6 drums of waste residue and 7,500 gal. of fire fighting/decon water were generated and removed from the site.",No comments provided.,Yes,BOX,"Box, wood or fiberboard not specified",BOX,No,,,,,,,1772,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,7000,"Nortru, LLC",US,

Upon arrival the trailer was leaking product from the rear door.  After reviewing the drivers paperwork it was determined that the only liquid material on the vehicle was Hydorgen Peroxide 35%.  The truck was pulled into containment and on-site response personnel entered the trailer and identified the leaking tote.  The tote was removed from the trailer and the remaining material transferred to another tote.  The trailer was unloaded and flushed three times with water to dilute the spilled H2O2.  The flush water was captured on the containment pad and large amounts of water was used to dilute the containment area prior to pumping off the material for disposal.  An estimated 516 liquid pounds of materail was lost with most all of it being contained in the trailer and a minimal amount being leaked out.","A more frequent visible and testing inspection of containers of this type could possibly identify potential container failure risk of this type prior to it occuring.  In addition, drivers have been instructed to perform more frequent inspections during transport so as to possibly identify such leaks more quickly.

A. Richter received call from CR Trainmaster C. Farina, advising CR crew detected an ammonia odor from tank car GATX 944, residue last contained Ammonia Solutions.    REACT activated by Mr. Richter.  Upon arrival, Mr. Richter met with CR mechanical inspector and Mr. J. McHugh, Tyburn RR (TYRR), Morrisville, PA, from where the car had been shipped (unloaded on a track at TYRR by Tanner Industries).  Inspection of car found slight ammonia odor eminating from the top of the car.  Further inspection by both Mr. Richter and REACT's R. Gould, found 83ppm reading from the vacuum relief valve located underneath the bread box. It was suspected that the internal pressure had built up during the day (non-insulated tank car) causing the detection of the product.    Due the nature of the product and intermitent odors detected, it was determined that the car would be moved back into the Tyburn RR facility, from which it originated, so that a contractor called in by the car owner/lessee could make the necessary repairs in a more controlled environment.  Car was moved back into Tyburn Railroad facility at approximately 0300, 8/2/08, without further incident and detection of odor.    Emergency response contractor SPSI (qualified and registered Class F/G) inspected the car at the Tyburn facility that day, and found the odor originating from the vacuum relief valve.  The vacuum relief was removed and replaced with a solid 2.5"" solid threaded plug. While pressure testing to insure leakproofness, another vapor leak was found at the 3"" liquid valve where it is threaded into the ""male mounting nipple"" (as reported by SPSI).  Attempts to secure the valve were unsuccessful.    Car owner/lessee Terra International applied for, and received FRA Movement Approval (08080252) to have the car shipped from Tyburn Railroad, to GATX Rail Corp., Waycross, GA for inspection and repair.

PTLX 223945 was cordoned off and nearby rail operations were suspended. BNSF mechanical and contract responder's initial investigation revealed that the 20 inch manway gasket was torn with a portion of the gasket material missing. A new manway gasket was installed and the manway was resecured on 8/08/08 and rail operations resumed. Spillage on PTLX 223945 was wiped and no ground impact was evident.  On 8/09/08, the same contractor returned after PTLX 223945 was reported venting in the railyard. Responders reinspected PTLX 223945 in greater detail and found several fitness and securement deficiencies. The vacuum relief valve (VRV) was not functioning properly. The VRV was removed and its orifice plugged. The threaded liquid valve was found to be less than tool tight. The valve was removed, Teflon tape applied to its threads, reinstalled and properly tool tightened. The liquid valve's mounting flange bolt nuts were found to be less than tool tight and all four of these nuts were tool tightened. In addition, the responders found the one inch vapor line closure plug at its threaded connection atop the housing plate to be less than tool tight. Responders determined that this was the source of the vapor release. The plug was removed and responders noted that the threads in the orifice appeared slightly worn.

A nearby BNSF contractor was called and immediately inspected GATX 44734. The contractor observed product being expelled from between the manway lid and the manway nozzle. The contractor relieved internal pressure from within GATX 44734 and opened the secured manway lid. Contractor reported that the manway gasket was missing and the product was approximately 1 1/2 inches from the manway lip (an overload condition). A new manway gasket was installed and the manway lid was resecured. GATX 44734 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard. No further product expulsion was observed after the manway was secured. All spillage was rapidly evaporating and no ground impact was evident. The shipper was notified to arrange for product reduction from GATX 44734 to achieve a suitable product outage level. On 8/22/08, 3000 gallons of product from GATX 44734 was off-loaded into a shipper arranged tanker truck. This was accomplished by 1500 hrs. CDT, 8/22/08 without further incident.

Due to the heavy odor a contractor was called to clean up the leak. Further investigation by the contractor revealed the IBC had a stress crack in the top of the container approximately 2.5 inches and was located on the seam of the IBC. This is where the product spilled from the container as the liquid sloshed during transportation. The contractor cleaned up a minimal amount of released material as the product had mostly evaporated and took the waste materials with them for disposal. The tote was moved on to the consignee and delivered clear. No further actions are necessary at this time.,Thorough inspection of containers prior to loading may have caught the defect in the tote.

Brentwood Dr.,SAINT LOUIS,MO,63144,Shipper,"Driver arrived on site to unload shipment.  He was directed to unloading area.  Driver had been to the location many times  Driver changed out the gasket on the Interchem hose prior to use.  Driver attached 2 sections of hose together (both Interchem Trucking & customer hose) to the back end of tanker to unload.  The Interchem hose was attached to the tanker and the customers hose was attached to the holding tank on site.  The 2 hoses were joined in the middle.  Driver began to pressurize the tanker with air from his tractor and a sample was removed for testing by the customer from the bleed off valve located on the tanker located before the hose conncetions on the tanker.  The driver already had on his ppe to attach the hoses and obtain the sample.  The driver proceeded to open the internal and external valves on the tanker to begin the unloading process.  By this time approximately 15 psi had been generated for internal pressure inside the tanker.  The driver went to the end of the tanker to check on the unloading after approximately 170 gallons had already been transferred.  As the driver bent down to check the connection at the back of the tanker, the hose ruptured 7-8 inches from the connection.  The acid sprayed the driver and the surrounding area.  The driver began to call for help as he walked down the tanker to shut off the engine to hault the air pressure from increasing inside the tanker.  The driver then entered a nearby safety shower to decontaminate himself.  By this time 514 gallons of acid had been lost to the unloading area through a break in the hose which covered 1/2- 2/3 the diameter of the hose.  The unloading area is cement lined and designed to control and contain any releases.  The acid dissolved the interal valve hydraulic pump line causing the release of the hydraulic fluid which in turn caused the internal valve to close.  The driver shutting off the air pressure and the internal valve closing is what limtied the release to 514 gallons.  By this time the customer had actived the EMS and the fire department arrived on site to treat the driver.  Once Interchem Trucking was notified of the incident, the National Response Center was notified.  This notification brought the MA DEP and the Coast Guard to the site as well as OSHA.  The customer's response team contained and cleaned up the spill.  The tractor and trailer were removed from the area and the driver was tacken to a local hospital before being transferred to a region hospital located in Rhode Island for treatment of chemcial burns.","Drives have been retrained on the use of personal protective equipment.

Driver at first did not cooperate with answering questions but later explained that the spill had occured when he opened his fill caps on the headers. The butterfly valve (the next valve after the internal valve) may not have been closed as required. Gasoline collected beyond the butterfly valve and escaped the pipe when the fill cap was removed. Driver cleaned spill with spill pads and washed down (against policy).,Driver had just recently been trained on how to handle a spill including reporting all spills.

During the preparation there was some confusion about how to properly vent the tankwagon, a newer type, during loading.  This issue was resolved and the loading was initiated.  When loading comenced it was noticed the loading hose had not been coupled to the tankwagon causing the liquid material to spill out on the ground and tankwagon.  The flow was shutoff and 400 gallons were determined to have been spilled.  The material freezes below 84 deg C and became solid on the ground and tankwagon.  All the material was confined to the tankwagon loading area with no release outside the containment area.  The spill was cleaned up thoroughly and disposed of in non-hazardous waste drums.  Water run-off from steam cleaning was contained and processed by the on-site waste water treatment facility.  The tankwagon was also thoroughly cleaned before being released back to the carrier.",The loading SOP was found to be lacking in detail as to the exact procedure to be used in loading.  Better wording would not have prevented the incident but it would have reduced the response time.  The wording will be changed.    Local controls at the point of loading could also have mitigated the size of the spill and will be considered for installation as a corrective action.    Positive contact verification via the DCS system could have prevented the incident by not allowing the load sequence to start without the hose being properly conected to the tankwagon.

The engineering employees evacuated the area. A CSX HazMat Sentinel discovered GATX 21423 to have product on the top and sides of the car and approximately 1 to 2 gallons on the ground, and it appeared that the Rupture Disc and its assembly was the release point. The car was isolated and the shipper, Olin Corp, from Niagara Falls, NY, NYS-DEC and a CSXT HazMat Manager were notified. EP+S of Vermont and SPSI, CSXT response contractors, where dispatched to the scene. The CSXT hazmat manager found that the rupture disc had actuated and that the retainer for the disc assembly had been unseated from the rupture disc housing. Of the 18 CSX engineering personnel in the area of the release, 13 employees were medically checked with the assistance of Erie County HazMat, Rural Metro Ambulance, Rescue Hose Fire Company, the City of Buffalo Fire Dept and HazMat Operations Team and CTEH for possible exposure to Sulfuric Acid. Contractor personnel EP+S of VT decontaminated the area where GATX 21423 had released product and decontaminated the equipment for any residue of possible product. SPSI changed out the complete rupture disc housing assembly, decontaminated the car and qualified the tank car repairs. GATX 21423 was released on August 28, 2008 for transport.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder immediately inspected RTMX 3174 finding liquid product on its side shell. The source of this liquid release was traced back to the threaded liquid valve connection which was two turns less than tool tight. The responder tool tightened the valve body and the liquid leak ebbed. The responder then depressurized the inner tank using the vapor valve. After RTMX 3174 was depressurized, the responder removed the liquid valve and applied Teflon tape to its threads. The liquid valve was then reapplied and tool tightened which ended any further liquid leakage. All spillage that didn't evaporate was wiped. Honeywell seal numbered 0073203 was removed and BNSF seal numbered 06157905 was applied in its place.  The side specification stencil on RTMX 3174 indicated that the last tank qualification was completed in the year 2004 and next due in 2014.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Hepaco, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the manway nozzle gasket missing which caused the release of product.  In addition, all four placards were missing from the railcar.  Hepaco representatives applied the required placards and installed a 20"" manway nozzle gasket.  The car was then released to destination.  Approximately 1 gallon was released from the container. This incident did not require a special switching move.

The cause of the roll-out was attributed to a defective hand brake on RTMX 12136. RTMX 12136 released product from the vapor valve that was damaged and sheared off during the derailment. During the derailment, the safety railing collapsed into the unpinned valve protective housing cover which bent the housing cover upward and into the body of the vapor valve. Product release ended when RTMX 12136 was up-righted at 0930 hrs. MDT, 8/28/08. The spilled product on the ground was mixed with aggregate and was used as paving material atop a nearby roadway in the railyard. The derailment damage to RTMX 12136 necessitated product transfer.

It was discovered that there was a leak coming from the bottom of the tote. After visual inspection by Mr. Rose and SWB/184 Operations Supervisor, Bruce Sweda, it was determined that a piece   of the outer metal wire container punctured the plastic tote on the bottom just behind the valve. The reported cause is that the metal cage around the plastic tote was rusted in locations. The bottom corner of the plastic tote that became punctured was from a portion of the metal cage that had sever  e rust, the metal was broke and pointed and punctured the plastic tote. ABF employees on location identified the cause of the puncture to be due to the rust as well the contracted clean up team. It was mentioned that the tote should have never been offered for transportation by the shipper nor accep  ted by ABF for transportation.~NOTE: this is a non-spec IBC.

Five of these derailed tank cars were compromised and involved in a product fire from the derailment. The cause of the derailment was attributed to the cross level of the track irregular, not at joints. The derailment occurred NE of the town of Luther, OK and authorities initially ordered a precautionary evacuation of residents within 1/2 mile of the derailment site. Later, the evacuation was expanded to one mile and three miles downwind. The evacuation impacted approximately 14 homes (approx. 35 people). All fires were extinguished around 2000 hrs. CDT, 8/22/08 and the evacuation was lifted. Air quality and soil monitoring were initiated and continued throughout this incident.  (Tank Car #1) TILX 193325 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) derailed on its side and incurred a side shell split toward the top of the shell towards the A-end. A product fire ensued from the compromised shell, the manway area between the nozzle and the manway cover and at the liquid valve. The fire was extinguished and the remaining product inside TILX 193325 was transferred into portable frac tanks after the tank car cooled off. Pooled product mixed with water and other liquids on the ground was vacuumed into portable frac tanks and earmarked for appropriate disposal.  (Tank Car #2) UTLX 207514 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) derailed on its side. A product fire ensued from the liquid valve and vapor valve orifices after these valves were sheared off in the derailment. The fire melted the manway gasket and leaking product ignited, adding to the product fire. The fire was extinguished and the remaining product inside UTLX 207514 was transferred into portable frac tanks after the tank car cooled off. Pooled product mixed with water and other liquids on the ground was vacuumed into portable frac tanks and earmarked for appropriate disposal.  (Tank Car #3)TILX 191938 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) derailed on its side. A product fire ensued around the liquid valve and the manway cover area. The fire was extinguished and the remaining product inside TILX 191938 was transferred into portable frac tanks after the tank car cooled off. Pooled product mixed with water and other liquids on the ground was vacuumed into portable frac tanks and earmarked for appropriate disposal.  (Tank Car #4)UTLX 201925 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) derailed on its side and all product within was deemed consumed from a fire that ensued from a pressure/heat induced tear in the side shell near the B-end. The fire was extinguished towards the end of the product burn off.  (Tank Car #5)TILX 194831 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) derailed leaning and lost product in the fire that ensued from a pressure/heat induced tear near the top side shell towards the B-end.

THE PAIL WAS LOADED BY A CONWAY EMPLOYEE IN THE middle of the trailer sitting between two palletized shippments. No dunnage or restrictive measures was used BY THE EMPLYEE TO KEEP THE PAIL STABLE IN TRANSIT.  THE pallets shifted in transit allowing the pail to fall over and become crushed by the moving pallets. The pail cracked DUE TO THE CRUSHING AND STARTED TO LEAK.  WHEN THE  trailer was opened at the Dock in Butte Mt. by a Conway employee an odor was noticed and the overturned Pail was seen by the employee.  The employee notified larry McGillvray the supervisor on shift ( myself) at which time I removed all employees from the immediate area until the leaking material could be identified.  There was no  equipment being used at the time of discovery. I retrieved the appropriate coso to identify the leaking product  and called Conway safety dept and Chemtrec emergency hot line to get instruction on emergency precautions and proper clean up and disposistion instructions.  Upon receiving instructions the spill was neutralized and cleaned up, putting the leaking pail and all contaminated clean up materials in an Over Pack container in the OS&D HAZARDOUS AREA AT THE BUTTE DOCK waitig for disposistion instruction from the Shipper",Conway has proper loading instructions in place for hazardous shipments if followed would have eliminated this spill.

IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LIQUID WAS THATOF, UN1210, PRINTING INK, 3,PG II.  TERRY CALLED HISDISPATCH WHO THEN CONTACTED WEST CENTRAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANTS (405-549-8487) TO CONTAIN THE SPILL.

WCEC FOLLOWED THE TRAILER TO THE CON-WAY FREIGHT DOCK TO FINISH THE CLEAN UP OF THE SPILL.  WITH THE HELP OF THE LOCAL CON-WAY FREIGHT SCM AND FOS (KEVIN TULLY AND CHRIS WILLIAMS), THE SPILL WAS LOCATED ABOUT EIGHT FEET IN FROM THE BACK OF THE TRAILER ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE.  THE SPILL BELONGED TO WAYBILL 236-614243.  THIS WAYBILL WAS FOR ONE 55 GALLON DRUM OF UN1210, PRINTING INK,3, PGII.  UPON REACHING THE DRUM IN THE TRAILER, APPROXIMATELY 40 GALLONS OF LIQUID HAD SPILLED FROM THE DRUM.  THE LEAKING WAS ISOLATED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE DRUM ONLY.  WHEN THE DRUM WAS REMOVED FROM THE TRAILER AND PUT IN A OVER PACK DRUM,WE COULD SEE THAT THE SEAM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRUM HAD FAILED.

Said driver after loading his trailer w/9377 gallons of Propane (UN1978).  Said driver after orientation at the loading facility drove his tractor/trailer onto Hwy 81 and approached the nearby Rail Road Crossing. Said driver failed to stop and pulled his truck on to the tracks.  Said driver failed to see the on coming freight train. (There are no warning lights or arms at the track).  The on coming train collided with the truck loaded with propane.  The crash caused the truck tank to explode releasing the propane in a large ball of fire and sent parts of the truck up to 2700+ feet from the scene. The trailer separated from the truck causing the trailer to swing around and up against the train engine causing the engineer and brakeman on the engine to loose their life.  Said truck driver was wearing his seat belt and was trapped in the burning truck.  The tanks on the truck had approximately   200 gallons of diesel fuel which burned and probably caused the death of the driver. He was extracted and sent to the Medford Hospital and later died at burn center located in Wichita, Kansas on Monday September 1st.    Nine police,Sheriff, 1st responders,ambulance and Vance Air Force Base responded to the fire and explosion.  There were no casualties during the fighting of the fire.  Electricity was knocked out in the town of Medford, Oklahoma for approximately 6 hours.  This account is to the best of our knowledge at this time.
