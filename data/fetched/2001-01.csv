THE ACID WAS PUMPED INTO THE DILUTE ACID TANK ALONG WITH WATER USED IN THE CLEAN UP. THE AREA WAS CLEANED AND DECONTAMINATED. SEE ATTACHED PAPERWORK EXPLAINING ACTION TAKEN TO PREVENT FURTHER OR FUTURE INCIDENTS. FOLLOWING THE UNLOADING SPILL INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED WITH OUT TANK WAGON (SERIAL #35263) AT THE MITSUBISHI PLANT IN THEODORE, ALABAMA, ON JANUARY 10, 2001, ASHLAND SPECIALTY CHEMICAL COMPANY IN PUEBLO, COLORADO, TOOK THE FOLLOWING MEASURES TO PREVENT SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN THE FUTURE. EXAMINED THE POINT OF THE EQUIPMENT FAILURE (THE QUICK CLEAN VALVE) USING PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN AT THE SCENE AT THE SCENE OF THE INCIDENT. THESE PHOTOS WERE COMPARED TO THE EQUIPMENT SETUP ON AN IDENTICAL TANK WAGON. THE TANK WAGON EQUIPMENT APPEARED TO BE IN PROPER ORIENTATION, AND THERE WAS NO DOCUMENTATION OF A CHANGE TO THE QUICK CLEAN VALVE OCCURRING AT THE PUEBLO FACILITY. MADE AN INQUIRY TO MITSUBISHI ASKING WEATHER THEY HAD PERFORMED MAINTENANCE TO THEIR EQUIPMENT. MITSUBISHI AFFIRMED THAT THEY HAD CHANGED THEIR UNLOADING HOSE IN SEPTEMBER. AFTER DETAILED DISCUSSION WITH MITSUBISHI CONCERNING THE CHANGE THAT HAD BEEN MADE, ASHLAND PURCHASED REPLACEMENT EQUIPMENT AS A GOODWILL GESTURE AND TRAVELED TO THE MITSUBISHI FACILITY TO ASSIST WITH THE REPAIRS. ASHLAND EXAMINED THE MITSUBISHI EQUIPMENT UPON ARRIVAL AND FOUND THAT THEIR UNLOADING HOSE HAD BEEN IMPROPERLY REASSEMBLED. ASHLAND PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN COMPLETING THE REPAIRS AND ALSO PROVIDED TRAINING IN THE PROPER TECHNIQUES FOR TANK WAGON UNLOADING.

UPON OPENING THE REAR DOORS OF THE CONTAINER AND FOUND NO PLACARDS, AND THE RAIL WAYBILL SHOWED THE CONTENTS TO BE FAK (FREIGHT ALL KINDS).  UPON OPENING THE DOORS, DEVELOPED THE LADING CONSISTED OF 35 DRUMS,  FLOOR LOADED, AND SECURED WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE GOOD BLOCKING AND BRACING PER AAR PAMPHLET 6C.  THE DRUMS WERE MARKED WITH FLAMMABLE AND SUBSIDIARY POISON LABELS.  AT THE TIME, THERE WAS NO WAY TO DETERMINE WHICH DRUM WAS LEAKING.  CONTACTED NYK LINE WHO PROVIDED THEIR SHIPPER.  BDP INTERNATIONAL, AND ALSO PROVIDED A COPY OF THE HAZARD DECLARATION, WHICH SHOWED THE CONTENTS TO BE ISOBUTYRONITRILE.  CONTACT WITH THE ACTUAL SHIPPER, EASTMAN, CONFIRMED THE CONTENTS, AND A MSDS WAS FAXED FOR REVIEW.  ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO REMOVE THE DRUMS TO INSPECT FOR THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK(S).  WHILE OFF LOADING THE DRUMS, OBSERVED ALL THE DRUMS HAD VARYING DEGREES OF DAMAGE FROM SPINNING WHILE IN TRANSIT.  THIS IS COMMON WHEN THE DRUMS ARE NOT STAGED TIGHTLY AGAINST EACH OTHER WHEN LOADED.  IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE DRUMS WERE THE NEWER STYLE WITH THE RECESSED SIDE WALL ROLLING HOOPS. WHILE THE NEWER STYLE DRUMS ALLOW FOR A ROW OF 4 DRUMS ACROSS THE CONTAINER, THEY ALLOW A 1/4 INCH GAP AT THE END OF EACH ROW.  IF THE INDIVIDUAL ROWS OF DRUMS ARE NOT OFF SET IN THE LOADING PROCESS, THEY WILL SHIFT AND ALLOW FOR MOVEMENT DURING TRANSPORTATION.  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT WHEN THESE TYPES OF DRUMS ARE UTILIZED, THEY BE LOADED IN A STAGGERED 4-3-4 PATTERN THAT WILL ALLOW THE DRUMS TO NEST AND STAY TIGHT DURING TRANSPORTATION.  4 ROWS INTO THE CONTAINER FROM THE REAR DOORS, LOCATED 1 DRUM, SECOND OUT FROM THE RIGHT SIDE WALL, THAT HAD THE BOTTOM CHIME WORN THROUGH.  THE CHIME HAD A FLAT SIDE SURFACE FROM ABRADING AN ADJACENT DRUM, ROUGHLY 3 INCHES LONG, WHICH PRODUCED A 3 INCH CRACK. ESTIMATED LOSS WAS 17 GALLONS.  THE DRUM WAS PATCHED AND PLACED INTO AN OVER PACK FOR SECUREMENT.  THE DRUM DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THIS ONE, WAS ALSO LEAKING AT THE BOTTOM CHIME, WITH SIMILAR TYPE DAMAGE.  ESTIMATED LOSS WAS 30 GALLONS.  THE DRUM WAS PATCHED AND PLACED INTO AN OVER PACK FOR SECUREMENT.  ANOTHER DRUM IN THE 5TH ROW, SECOND OUT FROM THE LEFT SIDE WALL, WAS FOUND TO BE COMPLETELY EMPTY.  THE DRUM HAD SPUN IN PLACE AND WORN THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE CHIME, CREATING A CRACK ROUGHLY 9 INCHES LONG.  AN ADDITIONAL DRUM WAS NOTED LEAKING FROM THE BOTTOM IN THE 2ND ROW FROM THE NOSE.

A STRONG PUNGENT ODOR WAS NOTED, INDICATING THE LISTED PRODUCT HAD BEEN RELEASED.  THE LIQUID ON THE GROUND WAS NEUTRALIZED AND COVERED WITH ABSORBENT.  INSPECTION OF THE TOP VALVE COMPARTMENT NOTED LIQUID DRIPPING FROM THE LIQUID LINE FLANGE, DIRECTLY ABOVE THE BALL VALVE.  THE 4 BOLTS ON THE FLANGE WERE TIGHT, INDICATING A PROBLEM WITH THE GASKET MATERIAL, AND AN OBVIOUS PRODUCT BY PASS OF THE BALL VALVE.  SEVERAL OUNCES OF PRODUCT WAS IN THE CATCH BASIN SURROUNDING THE VALVES, WHICH WAS NEUTRALIZED AND COVERED WITH ABSORBENT. THE AIR VALVE WAS CRACKED OPEN TO RELIEVE THE INTERNAL PRESSURE WITHIN THE TANK.  ONCE THE PRODUCT STOPPED LEAKING FROM THE LIQUID LINE VALVE, THE AIR LINE VALVE WAS SECURED.  THE IM TANK WAS THEN MOVED TO THE CUSTOM'S DOCK, WHERE IT COULD BE ISOLATED AND PROPERLY CONTAINED PENDING REPAIRS.

CONTACTED MATSON IN OAKBROOK TERRACE, IL., AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY RECORD OF THIS SHIPMENT EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOWED AS THE SHIPPER OF RECORD ON THE RAIL BILLING.

PRECAUTIONS WERE TAKEN TO PREVENT MOISTURE AND AIR INSIDE THE TANK WHILE THE VALVE WAS BEING REBUILT.  ONCE THE VALVE WAS REINSTALLED ONTO THE TANK, A NITROGEN BLANKET WAS PLACED INTO THE TANK TO PROPERLY PROTECT THE COMMODITY.
