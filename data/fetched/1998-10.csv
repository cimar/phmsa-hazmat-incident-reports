The trailer had been parked securely for 19 hours as three other trailers were brought to the purge site for the purge job at 2a.m. on 10/12/98. The local police notified the air products emergency operator in Allentown, Pa, that they noticed vapors coming from trailer 51-7216. A fifth trailer was being dispatched from our terminal in Lancaster, Pa. and our driver was advised that 51-7216 was releasing vapors from it's rear cabinet. At this time the driver leaving Lancaster was the closest response person to the scene. When the driver arrived in Exton at 4 a.m. he inspected the trailer emitting the vapors and then he tightly closed the fill/ withdrawal valve, stopping the leak which had developed due to the warming of the valve and a slight inner vessel pressure rise due to the extended parking time. The trailer was secured without further incident.

Upon investigation, the railroad conductor observed that twelve cars derailed. Five of the derailed cars were carrying sulfuric acid; one of the five leaked. A vapor cloud from the acid moved towards the head end of the train and in the direction of the small rural community of Portland Mills, PA. The train's engineer was exposed to the vapors and was taken to a local hospital for observation. He was released the following day. The Ridgeway Fire and Rescue was called at 1837. Elk County Hazmat team was notified shortly after. The incident commander from Ridgeway Fire and Rescue ordered that approximately 180 residents of the Portland Mills community be evacuated as a precaution. All other application regulatory agencies were advised. The railroad's emergency response contractor was called and arrived at approximately 0240 hours on 10/6/98. Much of the spilled acid was contained by the railroad road bed and kept away from the Clarion River. The contained material and surrounding soil was neutralized with lime and transported to a local certified landfill near Ridgeway. Approximately 1,500 ton of contaminated soil was removed. There are no other environmental concerns anticipated at this time. The PA department of environmental Protection was at the site during the clean up phase. The derailed tank cars were re-railed by Hulcher Services and moved by special FRA exemption to Bradford, PA for transloading into other tank cars and then on to the Buffalo and Pittsburgh's Shop in Butler, PA for evaluation and disposition.",,Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,830000,,US,

THE PORT OF HOUSTON FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS NOTIFIED, AND THE CONTAINER WAS TAKEN TO AN ISOLATED AREA.  THE DOOR WAS OBSERVED TO BE PARTIALLY OPEN.

THE CONTRACTOR CLEANED THE SPILLED MATERIAL (APPROXIMATELY 25 POUNDS) ON THE CONCRETE GROUND.

ON 10/27/98, A COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP WAS STARTED BY STRIPPING THE CONTAINER.  ALL PALLETS IN GOOD CONDITION WERE DECONTAMINATED FOR RELOADING.  DAMAGED BAGS OF MATERIAL WERE REMOVED, THE PALLETS WERE RELOADED, RE-WRAPPED AND SECURED.

CONTAINER GSTU264998 WAS DECONTAMINATED, THE FLOOR REMOVED AND WAS DELIVERED BACK TO SEA-LAND.  CAUSE AND CORRECTIVE ACTION:  IMPROPER LOADING, BLOCKING AND BRACING IS THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT PRODUCT SMOLDERED DURING THE VOYAGE, BECAUSE SOOT WAS OBSERVED ON THE CONTAINER DOOR, FLOOR, THE DUNNAGE AND PALLETS.

This resulted in the discharge of approximately 203 gallons of oxygen, refrigerated liquid onto the sidewalk and adjacent flower bed. The San Diego Fire Department and their Haz-mat incident response team responded. The haz-mat team closed the valve and thawed out the area with a water stream.

I AGREED TO CALL HIM AS SOON AS I KNEW SOMETHING. 1910   JEFF HUNT FROM THE PATHOLOGY LAB AT CASTLEVIEW HOSPITAL ARRIVED AND OPENED THE PACKAGE THAT HAD BEEN LEAKING. WE LOCATED SEVERAL LAB SPECIMENS SEALED IN PLASTIC CONTAINERS AND ENCLOSED IN HAZARDOUS MATERIAL BAGS. WE LOCATED A 600 CC CONTAINER THAT HAD BEEN LEAKING AROUND THE SEAL AND INTO THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL BAG. THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL BAG APPEARED TO ALSO BE LEAKING. THE CONTAINER WAS LABELED ""BIPRODUCT OF CONCEPTION"". JEFF TOLD ME THAT THE FLUID LEAKING WAS 10% FORMAL IN(UN #2209). HE SAID THAT IT WAS A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL AND AS LONG AS IT IS IN LIQUID FORM CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN. HE SAID THAT AFTER THE FLUID HAD DRIED ON THE BANK BAGS THEY WOULD BE OK TO TRANSPORT IN A CONFINED SPACE, LIKE AN AIRCRAFT, BUT NOT BEFORE. HE ALSO ASSURED US THAT THE BLOOD PRODUCTS WITH AFTER IT DRIES. JEFF TOOK THE LAB SAMPLES TO CASTLEVIEW HOSPITAL.
