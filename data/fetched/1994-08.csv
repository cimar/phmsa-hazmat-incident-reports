THE CONTAINER WAS LOCATED ON THE TRANSPORTATION VEHICLE WHICH HAD TRANSPORTED THE WASTE FROM THE GENERATOR'S SITE. ALLIED SIGNAL, 11100 NORTH ORACLE ROAD, TUCSON, ARIZONA (AZD981421449) WAS THE GENERATOR. THE WASTE WAS BEING TRANSPORTED BY CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT (ILD099202681) TO CHEMICAL WAS MANAGEMENT'S HAZARDOUS WASTE STORAGE FACILITY (AZT050010180). THE WASTE WAS TRANSPORTED USING A UNIFORM HAZARDOUS WASTE MANINFEST, MANIFEST DOCUMENT NUMBER 10247. THE WASTE SHIPMENT ARRIVED AT THE FACILITY ON AUGUST 2, 1994 AFTER NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FACILITY'S ARIZONA HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT ACT PERMIT, ATTACHMENT C, SECTION 7.2, THE VEHICLE WAS ALLOWED TO ENTER THE FACILITY AND WAS SECURED WITHIN THE PERIMETER FENCING. THE FOLLOWING MORNING PRODUCTION PERSONNEL, IN PREPARATION FOR PROCESSING OF THE WASTE INTO STORAGE, NOTICED A RELEASE OF MATERIAL FROM THE RING TOP OF AN OPEN HEAD STEEL 55-GALLON DRUM. APPROXIMATELY TWO (2) POUNDS OF A HAZARDOUS WASTE, U.S. DOT DESCRIPTION, RQ, WASTE PAINT RELATED MATERIALS, 3, UN1263, II, (ALCOHOL, METHYL ETHYL KETONE) HAD SEEPED FROM THE TOP OF THE DRUM ONTO THE BED OF THE FLAT-BED TRAILER ON WHICH IT WAS STORED AND ONTO THE GROUND. THE RELEASE DID NOT CONSTITUTE A ""REPORTABLE QUANTITY"". THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS THE EXPANSION OF THE LIQUID DUE TO HEAT. THE BED AND SIDEBOARD OF THE TRANSPORT VEHICLE WERE DECONTAMINATED WITH A DETERGENT SOLUTION. THE SOLUTION WAS ABSORBED USING TOWELING. ALL GRAVEL WHICH EXHIBITED VISIBLE STAINING WAS REMOVED. IN ADDITION, THE UNDERLYING SOILS, TO AN APPROXIMATE DEPTH OF THREE (3) INCHES, WERE REMOVED. ALL DECONTAMINATION MATERIALS, SOIL AND GRAVEL WERE MANAGED AS HAZARDOUS WASTE (F003, F005). FACILITY PERSONNEL DONNED STEEL-TOED BOOTS, TYVEK OUTER COVERING, LATEX INNER GLOVES WITH NITRILE OUTER GLOVES, FULL-FACE RESPIRATORS WITH ORGANIC VAPOR/HEPA CARTRIDGES FOR ALL OF THE ABOVE REFERENCED TASKS. CONTAMINATED PPE WAS ALSO MANAGED AS HAZARDOUS WASTE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FACILITY PERMIT, ATTACHMENT G, SECTION 7.2, A SAMPLE WAS COLLECTED FROM THE SPILL AREA AND FOUR (4) BACKGROUND SAMPLE WAS COLLECTED FROM THE AGRICULTURAL FIELD ADJACENT TO THE FACILITY. THE SPILL AREA MEASURED APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN (15) INCHES EAST TO WEST AND THIRTEEN (13) INCHES NORTH TO SOUTH. THE ATTACHED SITE MAP INDICATES THE LOCATION OF THE SPILL.

THE VELCRO STRAP WAS USED TO SECURE THE FITTING HOWEVER, DURING THE PRODUCT TRANSFER, THE STRAP SHIMMIED LOOSE AND MOVED FORWARD TOWARDS THE 2"" SECTION, THUS EXPOSING THE FITTING EARS TO OPEN.  1.  THE LAST PRODUCT PUMPED BEFORE THE ETHYL ACETATE WAS WHITE OIL. THIS WAS LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON.  APPARENTLY, DURING THE REDUCER DISCONNECT, THE PRODUCT SPILLED ONTO THE FITTING ACTING AS A LUBRICANT TO SUPPORT THE VIBRATION OF THE TRUCK PUMP AND ULTIMATELY THE DISCONNECTED FITTING.  3.  THE PUMP CONNECTED WITH TRUCK #24233 WAS USED TO MAKE THIS PARTICULAR DELIVERY.  IT VIBRATES SIGNIFICANTLY AND IS A CONCERN IN INSURING THAT EXTRA PRECAUTION IS TAKEN TO SECURE ALL FITTINGS CONNECTED TO THE PUMP.  4.  THE VELCRO STRAP WAS IN PLACE HOWEVER, NO EFFORT WAS MADE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SECUREMENT, REALIZING THE CONE SHAPED FITTING HAD A TENDENCY TO SLIDE FORWARD.  TOM HALL DISCUSSED HIS PRACTICE OF TIEING THE VELCRO STRAP THROUGH THE RINGS IN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STRENGTH, HOLDING THE FITTING EARS IN PLACE.  5.  DURING THE PRODUCT TRANSFER, DON MACK DECIDED TO INCREASE THE FLOW RATE BY TURNING UP THE PTO THROTTLE.  THIS ADDED ADDITIONAL PRESSURE TO THE 3"" X 2"" REDUCER THUS DISCONNECTING THE REDUCER FROM THE 3"" PUMP PIPING CAUSING THE PRODUCT RELEASE.  HIS REASONING WAS TO PUMP THE PRODUCT FASTER.  TYPE OF INCIDENT, PRODUCT RELEASE OF 2 GALLONS OF ETHYL ACETATE CONTAINED WITH ABSORBENT PADS. THIS OCCURRED WHILE ATTEMPTING TO BULK UNLOAD 1500 GALLONS USING A 3"" X 2"" REDUCER FITTING.  UNSAFE ACTS, 1.  DRIVER DECIDED TO INCREASE PTO THROTTLE TO PUMP OFF MATERIAL AT A QUICKER RATE.  THE REDUCER COUPLER COULD NOT TAKE THE EXTRA PRESSURE.  2.  EVEN THOUGH THE VELCRO STRAPS WERE USED TO SECURE THE LINES, THE DRIVER DID NOT CONTINUE TO DOUBLE CHECK HIS CONNECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE UNLOADING PROCEDURE.   THE STRAP LOOSENED UP DURING 3"" X 2"" REDUCER.

THE PRODUCT WAS TENDERED AS ""FERROUS SULFATE"" UN3077, A HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE, NOT A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. FOUR BLOCKS FROM THE SHIPPER, THE ADELANTO, CA POLICE STOPPED ALL THREE UNITS, AT DIFFERENT TIMES, BUT IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED, AND THE DRIVERS WERE TOLD THE SUPER-SACKS WERE LEAKING AND THAT THE PRODUCT WAS ""SULFURIC ACID"" WHICH IS A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL, AND HAS AT LEAST FIVE DIFFERENT UN OR NA NUMBERS.  ALL THREE UNITS WERE ESCORTED BACK TO THE SHIPPER, AND THE TRAILERS WERE DROPPED AND IMPOUNDED BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL VIOLATIONS CAUSED BY TECH-IRON.  THE MORNING OF AUGUST 17, 1994, BEGINNING AROUND 7:00 A.M., ATTEMPTS WERE MADE BY PAM MUSGRAVES TO CONTACT AT LT. GUNDERSON OF THE ADELANTO, CA POLICE DEPARTMENT WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF THE CONFISCATION OF THE LOADS.  AT 8:20 A.M. (AUGUST 17, 1994) LEN WAS ABLE TO CONTACT A TOM DALLING OF TECH-IRON WHO SAID HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE THREE LOADS. WHILE I WAS TALKING TO HIM, THE LOCAK POLICE ARRIVED AT THE FACTORY AND MR. DALLING SAID HE WOULD CALL ME BACK.  A FEW MINUTES LATER LT. GUNDERSON CALLED, AND HE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED, AND WHY:  ""TECH-IRON HAS BEEN UNDER SURVEILLANCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS.  THEY HAVE NO LICENSE OR PERMITS TO OPERATE THE KIND OF FACILITY THEY ARE RUNNING.  TECH-IRON HAS SET ROADRUNNER UP AND YOU (ROADRUNNER) HAVE BECOME AN INNOCENT VICTIM OF THESE VIOLATIONS"" I ASKY YOU? GUNDERSON STATED THAT THE PRODUCT IS ""SULFURIC ACID"" AND NOT ""FERROUS SULPHATE"".  I ASKED WHY THE THREE UNITS WERE STOPPED AND GUNDERSON STATED THAT SOME OF THE SACKS ON EACH TRAILER WERE LEAKING.  ALSO, IT WAS THOUGHT THAT ROADRUNNER WAS IN ON THE VIOLATIONS, BUT IT WAS LEARNED AT ONCE THAT THIS WAS NOT TRUE.  THE PRODUCT WAS DAMAGING OUR TRAILERS AND THE TRAILER TARPS, AND TIE DOWN EQUIPMENT MUST ALL BE DECONTAMINATED.  THE EPA WAS SCHEDULE TO ARRIVE AT TECH-IRON ON AUGUST 17, 1994 FOR AN INSPECTION.  I ASKED LT. GUNDERSON IF THERE WERE ANY CHARGES PENDING AGAINST ROADRUNNER AND HE STATE, ""NO WAY"".  HE FURTHER STATED TECH-IRON WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL DECONTAMINATION OF OUR EQUIPMENT. AT THAT POINT, HE SAID HE HAD TO GO AND THE CONVERSATION WAS OVER BUT COULD BE RESUMED LATER IF NEEDED.  LT. GUNDERSON'S TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (619)254-6572.  LATER THIS MORNING, I VISITED WITH ALL THREE DRIVERS. EACH DRIVER WILL BE SENDING ME A STATEMENT AS TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH EACH OF THEM FROM THEIR ARRIVAL AT TECH-IRON TO THE TIME THEY DROPPED THEIR TRAILERS BACK AT TECH-IRON.  ON AUGUST 17, 1994 AT 5:15 P.M., MIKE KHOUDARY CALLED LEN AT HOME AND SAID CATHY PERRY WAS ON THE TELEPHONE STATING THAT THE THREE (3) TRAILERS AT ADELANTO, CA WERE SETTING IN THE STREET.
