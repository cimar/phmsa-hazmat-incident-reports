TRAVLING SOUTH ON HWY 61 - APPROX 5 MILES BELOW OLIVER SPRINGS - AS HE APPR OACHED A DIP IN THE HIGHWAY HE SUDDENLY CAME UPON A VEHICLE WHICH WAS OVER THE LINE ON HIS SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.HE STEERED HIS TRUCK TO THE RIGHT ON TO THE SHOULDER TO AVOID A HEAD ON ACCIDENT. UNFORTUNATELY, THE SHOULDER NARR OWED TO ONLY ABOUT 6"" NEXT TO A DRIVEWAY CULVERT. THE IMPACT OF HITTING THE CULVERT CAUSED  THE TRAILER TO BOUNCE RIGHT AND T HE REAR WHEELS  DROPPED INTO THE DRAINAGE DITCH ON THE SHOULDER SIDE. WHEN THE TRAILER  WHEELS IMPACTED THE 2ND DRIVEWAY THEY CAUSED THE TRACTOR AND T RAILER TO ROLL OVER ONCE OR TWICE.

THE DRIVER HAD TO CLIMB THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDSHIELD SINCE BOTH DOORS WERE CRUSHED AND COULDN'T BE OPENED. HE WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BY AMBULANCE WHERE HE WAS TREATED FOR CONTUSIONS TO THE HEAD. 6 STITCHES FOR A CUT NEXT TO HIS EYE AND 5 STITCHES IN HIS LEFT THUMB. DESPITE HIS INJURIES THE DRIVER OBSERVED THE FUEL SPILL FROM THE 3RD COMPAR TMENT LID WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY AJAR. HE USED THE BROKEN EXHAUST STACK AS A WE DGE BETWEEN THE LID AND THE GROUND IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE FLOW OF PRODUCT F ROM THE TANK. WHEN THE BLAIR VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPT ARRIVED THEY USED BARS AND STAKES TO EXE RT MORE PRESSURE ON THE LID - HOWEVER. IT COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY STOPPED.
