During the loading process a drum was observed to have a minor leak at the bottom weld/seam. The leak appeared to be caused by corrosion of the drum material being caused by the waste the drum contained. The shipper was notified and all 6 drums of the waste stream were rejected for transportation. The shipper performed their own clean-up and the drums were left on site. The Oregon Emergency Management Division was notified. OEMD report #2014-1727.,"At the time the driver accepted the drums for transportation no evidence of leaking was observed. The driver, however, was re-instructed to conduct a thorough inspection of each container before acceptance and if any evidence of a reduction in structural integrity is found to take appropriate action to either place the container into a suitable salvage drum, re containerize, or reject before transportation is initiated. In addition, the shipper was advised of the incident. The shipper explained that they recently had a change in their production process that impacted the PH of the waste.

The car was isolated and the shipper Olin Corporation was notified, Rep. John Gabryelski, 716-870-1887, CHEMTREC Report 2014-08-04-00209, EP+S of Vermont, the Buffalo Branch, a CSX emergency response contractor was dispatched, as was CSX HazMat Manager Michael Bethge.  Upon inspection product was found to be dripping from between the jacket and a brake rigging attachment assembly, approximately 24 inches in toward the B-end of the tank car from the Bottom Outlet Valve, a Haz-Hammock was placed under the dripping area to contain the product release. The tank car was moved to a secure location, a calf car was identified and on August 5th, 2014 Olin Corp. conducted a transfer of product from TCIX 16035.  On August 13th, 2014 EP+S of Vermont conducted a clean + purge process on TCIX 16035 to remove all residue product from the tank car, and cut away the jacket area for inspection to identify the release point.   At present a visual review identified a crack in the weld seam on the B-R weld pad, located at the outer edge of the weld to the tank shell of the skid plate protection mounting point, see attached photos.

The driver had loaded UN1075 product at O'Ryan Oil & Gas(Texon) in Powell, Texas and was traveling to the ELTM facility in Oakwood, Texas to deliver. While traveling on Hwy 287 the driver came upon a thunderstorm. Rain was heavy and the trailer traveled off of the right shoulder. When the driver tried to bring the trailer back onto the road, the product shift created the roll over of the unit. The trailer slid to the right and detached from the fifth wheel of the truck and rolled onto the right shoulder and ditch, coming to rest near a fence. The driver notified 911 and proceeded to call management and contain the scene. The driver inspected the trailer and found no leaks or structural failures and reported this to local officials and his supervisor. Upon notification of incident, reporting procedures were followed to include Federal and State notifications were made. There were no injuries, deaths, or product release during this incident.","Retraining of driver will be reviewed during investigation process.

Portable containment was placed under ACFX 86864 to capture drippage. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspecting ACFX 86864 reported the leak source was at the area of the saddle welds (BOV mounting flange welded to the tank bottom) towards the B-end direction. The saddle weld at the leak area measured approximately 5/8 inch wide by 10-11 inches in length; a pinhole crack within this weld area was suspected, although not specifically located. Contract responders attempted to seal this leak using 'Plug N Dike' sealant, but were unsuccessful in stopping the dripping. ACFX 86864 was carefully moved and isolated over the facility's containment pit with additional containment placed under the BOV to capture the commodity dripping down the outside of the BOV.  Commodity spillage in the railyard evaporated.  Contract responders transferred the remaining commodity within ACFX 86864 into four tank trucks on 8/06/2014 without further incident.  After the transfer was completed the commodity drips ceased.  Spillage in the containment pit was diluted by two rain events that occurred while ACFX 86864 was awaiting commodity transfer. The liquid in the containment pit was vacuumed and processed at the facility's waste water treatment plant on 8/7/2014.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,9240,BNSF Railway Company,US,

A dry adsorbent material was spread over the affected areas of the exit ramp, route to Loves Truck stop SR 39, side road, Kroger way and the area of Loves truck stop where the tanker was parked.  The adsorbent material was collected, drummed and removed from the site.

A BNSF mechanical visual inspection of UTLX 299036 revealed commodity had leaked from its manway closure onto its top side shell. Contract responders arrived and observed that UTLX 299036's manway cover was not seated flush against the manway nozzle. A detailed inspection of the manway closure revealed that the manway securement eyebolts were not uniformly tightened (the eyebolts on one side of the manway cover were tighter than the other side that were looser). The installed manway gasket was found to be grooved on the side were the eyebolts were very tight and not providing a good seal. The manway gasket was replaced and the manway securement eyebolts were properly tool tightened in the recommended pattern.  All other valves and fittings were found secure. Non-evaporated spillage around the manway nozzle was wiped. Intact shipper seals Uline 3068166 and 3068165 were replaced with seals numbered 051398 and 051395 respectively.

The drums were unloaded until the leaking drum was identified.  The drum contained flammable solvents (Xylene/Toluene listed in the shipping description). The drum had no ruptures, dents, or otherwise any other sign of damage.  The side and top of the drum showed evidence of leaking material.  The bung and ring closure were inspected and found to be tight, however, the contents of the drum had expanded in the heat during storage on the trailer and leaked out the top bung and from around the ring closure. Approximately 0.5 gallons of material was estimated to have leaked.  The leaking drum was overpacked into a salvage drum.  The leaked material was cleaned up with absorbent and placed inside the salvage drum, and then the van trailer was re-loaded, and transported to the Veolia Port Arthur Facility for disposal.","The Veolia Account Manager will communicate with Qualawash regarding the incident and reccomend they review their filling procedures and training and ensure that adequate head space is left in drums of organic solvents, especially during hot weather.",No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,64,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

The truck stayed upright and the trailer overturned on its right side and spilled out 180 bbls of crude oil due to the force of the impact. The force caused the dome lid to pop off and the bands broke near the rear of the trailer spilling the oil. The oil spilled out at a very high rate of speed with the dome having been popped off.

Not much could be done to mitigate the release but every measure has been taken to clean it up.,"We have terminated the driver for unsafe driving. We spend two weeks with every driver at hire to train them in safe driving and being aware of hazards. They take the smith systems defensive driving coarse at hire and spend one week in classroom training. Then they spend six days with a driver trainer learning how to properly and safely operate a vehicle. We have standard operating procedures and driving practices in our fleet safety manuals that are issued to every driver and they are trained on during their first two weeks. We also pull MVRs, do annual reviews, and follow them on Peoplenet, our electronic onboard recorders. This driver was found to be under the influence of drugs and alcohol.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Axiall Corp, was notified via CHEMTREC Report # 2014-0827-00165. Joseph McCann, a CSXT hazardous materials manager, found product leaking from 2 separate flanges on the liquid line assembly due to mounting flange bolts being less than tool tight.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative, Matt Bond 304-455-6708.  The mounting flange bolts were tightened, however, the release could not be secured.  The contents of the tank car were transloaded on site and the liquid line assembly, including the liquid line induction pipe, was removed from the car and a blind flange was installed.  The car will be moved to home shop for repair once the shipper has obtained the necessary OTMA.  A special switching move was required.  A QA 7.1 will be filed.

Prior to this notification, PLCX 221754 was interchanged by BNSF to the RARW (Rarus Rwy. Co.) in Butte on 7/30/2014. The RARW alleges it never took possession of PLCX 221754 due to the leaking BOV. The BNSF called contract responders to inspect and secure PLCX 221754. Responder's inspection of PLCX 221754 revealed that the BOV was in the closed position. The commodity droplets were dripping from this valve's cap assembly's closure plug area and the likelihood of liquid by-passing the closed bottom outlet valve was suspected.  The BOV's closure plug was found not tool tight and responders tool tightened this closure plug by 1/2 full turn which stopped the commodity dripping by 1615 hrs. MDT, 8/08/2014. Afterwards, all surfaces encompassing the BOV were decontaminated. Ground impacted soils under the BOV were hand shoveled and placed into a poly disposal drum for appropriate future disposal.   PLCX 221754 continued to be monitored with no further commodity dripping observed. Response was concluded by 1930 hrs.

Reportedly there was product around and inside of the reclosing pressure relief device PRD. The tank car was removed from the outbound train and isolated. The shipper, Ashta Chemicals, was notified via Chemtrec, report #2014-08-26-00098. Sunpro, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the Collinwood Yard. Sunpro found that the PRD was in fact releasing product and would need to be replaced prior to continuing in transportation. The shipper representative, Jeanne Kochevar, 440-997-6862 was notified of the situation found. Ashta Chemicals is having a mobile repair facility replace the faulty PRD and will move under One Time Movement Approval if requalification of the tank car is impractical. GATX 90905 is currently on hold pending the appropriate actions.  This incident did require a special move.

We broke the seal and began unloading the cargo looking for the source of the leak; cargo was noted to be packed high in the unit.  The leaking IBC was near the nose of the trailer.  The cause of the spill was a wooden pallet with cargo that had been placed atop the IBC.  Being a non-load bearing structure, the pallet was able to press down on top of the cap, causing it to leak on estimated 15 gallons of class 8 PG III.  The vendor was not initially able to confirm if it was corrosive leaking as the dye made it impossible to read the litmus paper the vendor had brought with them.  Subsequent analysis of photos of the cargo confirmed it was corrosive that was leaking.  Our hazmat vendor remediated the spill, repackaged the leaking contents and disposed of the subsequently-generated hazardous waste.",The shipper has been suspended from shipping hazmat with JBH pending review of their loading & securement techniques.  This spill was caused by shipper negligence; in my opinion it was quite careless and irresponsible for them to have loaded a pallet on top of an IBC of class 8 hazmat.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,20000,J.B.

GATX 79883 was cordoned-off. A BNSF hazardous material responder inspecting GATX 79883 reported finding its liquid valve partially open with its closure plug not sealing in the valve port due to worn threads on the plug. These conditions allowed liquid commodity to escape at the liquid valve's closure. The responder closed the liquid valve and secured a replacement closure plug in the valve port. All spillage evaporated.   Also noted during GATX 79883's inspection was five of the applied manway cover securement eyebolts were not tool tight with the sixth eyebolt hanging or not applied. The responder properly secured all six manway cover eyebolts to a tool tight condition. Two of four applied placards were faded and these were replaced.

Once off of the roadway, the carrier’s vehicle rolled onto its right side.  Some of the IBCs (approximately 5) inside the carrier's trailer ruptured and approximately twenty-five (25) gallons of product leaked out.  Law enforcement and fire-rescue came upon the scene immediately.   The carrier immediately contacted all other necessary entities (the customer/shipper, the lead-logistics provider, Chemtrec, third party environmental company, and a towing and recovery company).    Fire-rescue oversaw the initial containment, and the third-party environmental company handled the eventual clean-up of the spill.  The towing/recovery company transloaded the remaining undamaged product into another trailer owned by the carrier, and it was brought back to the point of origin (i.e. the shipper).","This incident was beyond the scope of the control of the carrier and the shipper.

At times, this includes transferring containers from one pallet to another. The drum in question was slid off the pallet by the technician onto the ground, a height of 4 inches. When the drum contacted the ground, a crack developed from the bottom, went about halfway up the drum and then went horizontal, several inches in each direction around the drum causing liquid to immediately release from the drum. The second technician rolled the drum so the crack was on top to prevent any further liquids from spilling out. Approximately, a third of the drum's contents were released as a consequence of the event. Sorbent socks and absorbent were immediately put in place to contain the spill. Management was notified. Employees suited up and cleaned up the spill and placed the damaged drum inside an overpack drum. The absorbent and clean-up material were added to the overpack drum. The spill was localized without any injury or environmental impact. The release did not pose a threat to public health, the environment, or equal or exceed a federal RQ.","Employees were re-trained on container management and inspection with an emphasis on inspecting containers for signs of aging, deterioration and damage; along with a review of spill procedures during our monthly safety training meeting. There was a review of our internal SOP's as they relate to transfer procedures and spill response and being updated, accordingly.

While traveling on Interstate 10 in New Orleans, Louisiana, tractor-trailer was involved in a rollover, which caused fire to ignite in vehicle. Approximately 8,660 gallons of gasoline were being transported at the time of the incident. An undetermined amount of gasoline was burnt up as a result of the fire, with the remaining product releasing to the soils adjacent to the roadway, and the nearby storm drain system. Local Fire Department responded to extinguish the fire, which caused the water run off and gasoline to migrate through the drainage system and release through the outfall. ES&H of Houma, Louisiana was dispatched to perform the cleanup. Upon arrival on site, ES&H used a vacuum truck to recover the free product from within the drainage system. ES&H proceeded to flush the drainage system and coordinated excavation of impacted soils within the woodland area adjacent the roadway. ES&H returned to the site on several occasions to excavate impacted soils, which were containerized into roll off boxes on site, pending disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. ES&H also utilized a vacuum truck to recover the accumulated rain water from within excavation pits throughout remediation. Approximately 720 yards of contaminated soil, and 33,700 gallons of contaminated waters were generated during response efforts. Confirmation samples were pulled, and site will be restored to pre-existing condition, upon receipt of analytical sampling results. There were no injuries or exposures reported.",Dupre Logistics will continue to train and reinforce safe handling procedures and driver safety to all personnel.,Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,259000,SPILL CENTER INC.,US,

He noticed white smoke coming from under the engine hood. When he lifted the hood, he noticed a fire, and went to the driver's side to retrieve a 20-lb ABC fire extinguisher. Upon return to the front of the vehicle, he determined the fire was unable to be extinguished, moved to a position of safety, and initiated his ERAP using his mobile phone. The mine was evacuated, and an initial evacuation area of V* mile established. MSHA Inspectors were on site and were immediately made aware of the incident. Emergency responders (Police and Fire) arrived. No attempt was made to re-enter the incident area to extinguish the fire. First responders evacuated nearby residences and stopped traffic. The company called their emergency spill and cleanup consultant who summoned their network contractor and their Independent Investigator to the mine.Clean up was held up while MSHA investigated, while the independent investigator conducted his analysis. The AN was not damaged, and was off-loaded into a mine blasting truck, and used as originally intended in blasting. The fire debris was cleaned up by the spill contractor, and the truck body and engine/transmission were removed from the mine.","Our preventative maintenance form is being amended to specifically state the following: ""trace wiring, check for cuts and abrasions"".",Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,40,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,150000,AUSTIN POWER COMPANY,US,

The separator outfall was closed and Clean Harbors was called to the facility to conduct cleanup activities, which included using a vacuum truck to remove product and water from the trench drains, deploying absorbent pads to absorb residual product, and completing a hot pressure wash of the area. Approximately 823 gallons of product and water mixture and approximately 100 pounds (4 bags) of oily solids (absorbent pads) were removed and sent off-site for proper disposal.",Appropriate offloading procedures were followed.
