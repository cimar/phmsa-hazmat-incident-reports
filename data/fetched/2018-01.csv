The Inspector, Anthony Schneider called myself John Vergis Environmental Officer for WLE, to come out and investigate.  When I arrived, I found that the valve handle on the Vapor Valve was loose.  The Valve plug was tight but I was able to get about another 3/4 turn out of the plug.  The shipper did install thread tape on the plug threads but the plug just wasn't tightened enough.  I closed the valve handle and the leak stopped and then I finished tightening the plug.  I then released the car for service.

After the tanker was loaded, the driver moved the unit to the onsite scale to weigh the load prior to exiting the facility. It was during this movement that a small amount of the material was released from the dome hatch on the unit, caught in the overflow tray and subsequently released to the asphalt on Huntsman’s facility. Facility personnel, in proper personal protective equipment successfully remediated all impacted areas; asphalt only, no water ways, storm drains or soil were impacted. Through the investigation it was determined that the driver failed to check the securement of the dome hatch after facility personnel loaded the trailer, thus causing a release onsite. A courtesy report was made to Emily Bourg of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, who elected to not input the release into the states spill data base as it was below the reportable quantity, therefore no report number was generated. The tanker was thoroughly secured and made its way to its final disposal destination without further incident.",The driver was retrained on proper load securement specific to  vacuum tanker operations and issued disciplinary action.

This railcar had previously been partially loaded and was to be filled the rest of the way with product for shipment to customer.  While loading the maximum capacity of the car was exceeded and approximately 3,717 gallons of 99.9% phenol went into secondary containment. This material subsequently breached the secondary containment and material entered the street and W-Sewer (PWD) before the leak was identified and isolated, release lasted approx 8 minutes. Plant emergency response team mitigated further entrance of material into the sewers. Notifications to outside agencies were made by plant personnel.",Corrective Actions:  Re-train shipping department operators on loading procedures: specifically on FLS sign off and physical weigh ticket verification. Train Bridge Street guards that practice of providing heel volumes over the phone is unacceptable. Re-write SOPs for shipping department to remove ambiguity and other errors in the procedures. Improve lighting in the loading areas. Provide large flashlights for use in examining car interiors to shippers in their shanty areas. Determine if yard master system can provide heel volumes and help to mistake-proof the transfer of information.

(Nonene) STCC 4912259 was found leaking in the BNSF railyard in Denver, CO. The leak was discovered by BNSF transportation personnel.  Upon further inspection the leak was found to have originated from the sample line under the combination housing.  The cause of the leak was a partially opened sample line valve and the secondary closure plug was not installed.  BNSF hazmat responder closed the sample line valve approximately one full turn which stopped the active leak.  He then properly installed the secondary closure plug.  This release resulted in several yard tracks shut down for a few hours to control ignition sources and allow for environmental remediation of the soil.  It is estimated that the liquid lost was 50 gallons, 25 of which was collected in a portable catch basin.  Response contractor handled remediation.  Two yard employees were taken to local hospitals for exposure evaluation.

An emergency crew wearing the correct personal protective equipment was summoned; they over-packed the three drums into suitable UN spec over pack drums of the correct UN specification. The trailer floor was cleaned, and the waste generated in the cleanup was placed inside the overpack drums. The waste continued to it's final destination without incident.     A management team investigation determined that these drums had not been adequately prepared for transportation, in that the drum ring gasket condition and gasket seating was questionable, and the drums likely lacked sufficient head space which led to build up of excess pressure.     This release fell below the state reporting guidelines.","At the time these drums were placed into transportation, there was no evidence of a release. The generator has been contacted, and made aware of the issues at hand. We have asked the generator to retrain it's personnel on correct drum closure instructions, with an emphasis on being sure the drum ring gasket is in proper condition and that the drum ring is seated correctly using a dead blow hammer when required. We have also asked the generator to leave sufficient head space in drums.",No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc.,US,

RAY RILEY,DIRECTOR OF SAFETY,,,,,Carrier,The cargo tank trailer was involved in a crash on an ice covered roadway. The truck struck a small pickup truck in the rear and left the highway to the right striking trees and a dirt embankment. The trailer rolled to the left landing on the driver side parallel to the roadway.     Emergency responders reported a possible drip from a pressure relief device located on the top of the cargo tank trailer. A containment device was placed under the valve. Later it was determined the valve did not leak. The material was water.     Miller personnel along with an ER contractor responded to the incident.

They did not discover any of the liquid filled capacitors to be leaking, and the box lining was intact. These capacitors, along with the oil-stained box, were repacked into an appropriate UN specification cubic yard box and continued to the final waste destination without further incident.     An investigation revealed that the original box had become stained during initial loading when a facility technician forgot to put a plastic liner into the box as required and then broke a capacitor while loading it into the box.  The oil from that break stained the fiberboard box, and the technician decides to reuse the same stained box after cleaning that release, putting a liner into the box as originally required.

I answered the call andresponded right away. When I showed up to the Unload area, MeeRan had the hazmat in her hands and handed it to me. I then took the hazmat to the damage cage and put it in a red hazmat tote. I then went back to the spill site and started the clean up. I found a couple packages that were near the hazmat and removed them because they were wet. I then lifted one of the flaps and noticed that it spilled down into the belly of the trailer, so I called over the other QA (Kurt). After clean up, I talked to the PH about how he found the package and all of that. I then went and inspected the package. Upon inspection, I found a small puncture on one of the bottom corners. The puncture was smaller than a dime. There is no actual way to tell how the package was punctured, but with how small the hole is, it had to have been leaking for the whole time it was in the trailer. It is a possibility that it was punctured before or while it was being loaded at the origin station.

The driver immediately stopped and called for an emergency response. When parked and not moving, the vehicle stopped leaking, as the release was from the tank dome lid. The spill impacted asphalt, soil, and the nearby body of water. An emergency response crew wearing the correct personal protective equipment was summoned and fully cleaned and remediated the release. The South Portland Fire Department responded as well but did not assist in the actual cleanup. The South Portland Police Department provided traffic control. All waste generated from the cleanup was placed into the appropriate UN specification packages and disposed of in the appropriate waste stream.      An investigation revealed that the driver did not ensure the dome hatch was adequately closed before transportation; the movement of the truck while driving caused the fuel to splash from the unsecured dome lid. After the dome lid was fully tightened, the fuel load was delivered to it's intended destination without further incident.    The incident was reported to the State of Maine report #P-42-2018, US Coast Guard/NRC report #1202343.","The driver of this tanker received formal disciplinary action for failing to adequately perform a pre-trip inspection of this tanker.

No apparent dmg to outer or inner boxes. release may have begun on delivery van, but difficult to determine. Perhaps 3 hours release time,depending on when the package was damaged and not upright. Small amount of liquid released, most of which was absorbed by outer and inner boxes. Small drips on dock were neutralized and cleaned up using proper PPE and neutralizing powder.

HOWEVER, DELIVERY WAS STOPPED AFTER UNLOADING 2245 GALLONS WHEN OIL WAS OBSERVED EXITING THE TANK VENT PIPE IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING. THE TANK DELIVERY DRIVER DID NOT IMMEDIATELY NOTICE THE OVERFILL. WHEN HE DID, HE DISCONTINUED PUMPING FROM THE TRUCK (THE TIME ELAPSED IS ON THE ORDER OF MINUTES). THE TANK DELIVERY DRIVER REPORTED TO THE NYSDEC HOTLINE THAT A SPILL OF 10 GALLONS WAS RELEASED.   ADJACENT TO THE VENT PIPE IS A STORM DRAIN, WHICH DRAINS DIRECTLY TO TITUS MILLPOND, A TRIBUTARY TO LONG ISLAND SOUND. (SEE FIGURE 1.) THE SPILLED OIL FLOWED INTO THIS DRAIN. IMMEDIATELY, THE BUILDING SUPERINTENDENT CLEANED UP ALL VISIBLE OIL AROUND THE DRAIN USING SORBENT MATERIAL. BECAUSE THE DRAIN AND GROUND WERE COVERED WITH ICE, IT WAS BELIEVED THAT ALL OIL HAD BEEN CAPTURED. DEC WAS SHOWN OUR EFFORTS AND INSPECTED THE SITE AND WAS CONTENT WITH THE EXTENT OF THE CLEANUP BY 1/16. WE BELIEVED THAT THE CLEANUP WAS COMPLETE.   HOWEVER, ON 1/19.18, OIL WAS OBSERVED IN TITUS MILLPOND NEAR THE STORM SEWER OUTFALL AND ALONG THE SHORELINE. ON BEHALF OF THE BUILDING OWNER, I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED NYSDEC AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC). THE BUILDING OWNER CONTACTED A CLEANUP CONTRACTOR, NORTHEAST ENVIRONMENTAL. NORTHEAST ARRIVED AT THE SITE THAT AFTERNOON AND INITIATED COMPREHENSIVE CLEANUP EFFORTS INCLUDING CONTAINMENT BOOMS, SWEEPS, AND SORBENT MATERIALS. MUCH OF THE SPILL WAS CONTAINED NEAR SHORE DUE TO EXTENSIVE ICE IN THE MILLPOND. DURING THE PERIOD 1/19/18 TO 2/7/18, NORTHEAST POWER WASHED THE ROCKS ON THE SHORELINE. THE BUILDING OWNER ALSO ARRANGED FOR THE STORM DRAIN PIPE TO BE STEAM WASHED. ALL NORTHEAST’S USED MATERIALS WERE DISPOSED OF AT TRADEBE RECYCLING IN BRIDGEPORT, CT. A MORE DETAILED CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS IS PROVIDED IN APPENDIX A.  FOR THE SIX WEEKS FOLLOWING THE SPILL (AND CONTINUING TODAY), NORTHEAST PERFORMED MONITORING AND RE-POSITIONING OF THE BOOMS AND SWEEPS TO RESPOND TO STORMS, WIND, AND TIDAL FLUCTUATIONS. ALSO DURING THIS PERIOD, ANY VISIBLY OIL-COATED SURFACES WERE ADDRESSED USING SORBENT PADS. THE NYSDEC REPRESENTATIVE, TODD GHIOSAY, HAD CONTINUED TO MONITOR CLEANUP PROGRESS. WITH CONDITIONS BEING MUCH IMPROVED TODAY, THE OWNER ANTICIPATES RECEIVING PERMISSION FROM MR. GHIOSAY TO DISCONTINUE CLEANUP MEASURES IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.","MEASURES TAKEN TO PREVENT RECURRENCE ARE AS FOLLOWS:  1. A NEW VENT WHISTLE WAS INSTALLED ON TANK.  2. OIL DELIVERIES HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED THIS WINTER AND SINCE THE BUILDING HAS A DUEL FUEL BURNER AND USES GAS, AND THE WEATHER CONTINUES TO WARM, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT NO FURTHER OIL DELIVERIES WILL BE NECESSARY UNTIL NEXT WINTER.   3. THE BUILDING IS SWITCHING TO #2 FUEL OIL IN ACCORDANCE WITH COUNTY REQUIREMENTS. WHEN THIS CHANGE OCCURS, A HIGH LEVEL ALARM AND NEW PETROMETER WILL BE INSTALLED ON THE TANK.

This was a Murphy equipment issue, not an ETC equipment issue. Murphy contacted their own environmental contractor, NRR, to clean up the site. This was the second time the Murphy vapor recovery popped of in as many deliveries. Before we delivered a second load after the first incident, ETC waited on an 'OK' from Murphy that their vapor recovery was fixed. Murphy sent ETC an email (1/24/18 5:26PM) stating that repairs were made and that ETC could deliver. Obviously, repairs on Murphy's end were not properly completed and ETC had a 2nd incident.    Due to Murphy equipment failure, Murphy handled all of the clean up and related expenses.

All valves were closed and observed to be leak free and driver was allowed to leave the plant and took the trailer to a Miller shop for evaluation and repair. The external valve was found to have a hair line fracture on the inside of the external flange at the weld. The external valve was replaced and bracing was installed on the discharge line to reduce the stress on the line at that location.
