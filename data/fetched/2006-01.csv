This driver did a pre-trip inspection and found the trailer leaking. Further inspection identified the leak to most likely be coming from the load   of 6 totes. A clean up team was contracted. They entered the trailer and inspected the totes. They found that a release valve did not function properly.  The temp reached 71 on this day causing the tote to expand and release some of the product. The team identified a small split at the top and botto  m of the leaking tote. There was also 1 other tote found building pressure but the tote had not failed yet. The clean up team released the pressure from the tote before any damage occurred.

The person working in the yard notice liquid leaking out of the trailer and had me go outside to inspect.  He brought the trailer to our dock door and the leaking drum was placed upside down in a recovery drum.  There was a small slit in the bottom of the drum (less than an inch long).  I could not identify the cause of the slit.  We weighed the drum that was not leaking (668 lbs) and the drum that was leaking (368 lbs inside of the recovery drum).  Estimated that approximately 25 gallons had leaked out in transit.,It is difficult to make recommendations because it is not apparent as to the cause of the leakage.

He immediately called for a spill clean up crew.  Upon arrival, a Site Safety meeting was held with the local Fire Department and emergency management officials, who at which time, a Plan of Action was developed and agreed to. Summitt then donned personal protective equipment and opened the trailer doors. An evaluation was performed utilizing an air meter and the air quality and explosion level of the environment was determined. All levels were within normal limits and 0% levels were determined. Summitt then entered the trailer and evaluated the load and determined that 1 55 steel drum that was banded to a pallet had released approximately half of the volume in the drum. The floor area was saturated with the product. Summitt placed absorbent products on the floor areas and recovered the liquid. A fork lift was requested, received and utilized to remove the packages. All packages were removed and examined for the product and placed onto the plastic next to the trailer. The damaged drum was inspected and it was determined that there was a small hole in the bottom of the drum that appeared to develop from a rubbing action with the pallet. No obvious nails were present on the pallet. The drum was then overpacked into a 95 gallon poly overpack and secured. The pallet was removed and dismantled and placed into a 55 gallon drum. The remaining area was cleaned using absorbent product and industrial agents. The driver then examined the trailer and determined no other product existed. The trailer was reloaded with the poly overpack remaining on the trailer and continuing on to the destination. 1 55 gallon steel DOT approved drum was used in the cleanup. The area was secured and the driver released to his destination.","A suggestion will be made to all shippers to inspect the quality of their drums prior to any shipment.

I FELT MY FRONT TIRE SLIDE INTO THE BAR DITCH AND THEN THE REAR FOLLOWED. I FELT THE TRUCK TIP TO THE RIGHT. FEARING THE TRUCK ROLLING OVER TO THE RIGHT, I REACTED BY TRYING TO DRIVE THE TRUCK BACK UP TO ROAD BY TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE LEFT. I GOT THE TRUCK BACK ON THE ROAD AND FELT THE TRUCK REAREND SLIDE BACK AND FORTH. I TRIED TO REGAIN CONTROL BUT WENT OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD AFTER APPLYING THE BRAKES AND SLIDING THROUGH THE BAR DITCH. THE TRUCK THEN ROLLED ONTO THE LEFT SIDE. I COULD HEAR AND SMELL PROPANE LEAKING, I SHUT THE MOTOR OFF AND CLIMBED OUT OF THE TRUCK. I THEN CALLED THE OFFICE. (ERICIA) CALLED DPS AND THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, THEN THE COMPANY MANAGER WAS CALLED AND HEADED FOR THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT. JEFF THE MANGER, CALLED MIKE THE DRIVER TO GET THE INFORMATION ON THE ACCIDENT AND MAKE SURE THE DRIVER WAS OKAY. MIKE TOLD JEFF THE TRUCK WAS LEAKING FUEL BUT HE WAS NOT SURE WHERE. JEFF TOLD MIKE TO KEEP PEOPLE AND VEHICLES WAY FROM THE AREA. WHEN JEFF ARRIVED TO THE FIRE, DPS AND SHERIFFS DEPT. WERE ALL ON THE SCENE AFTER DETERMINING THE LEAK WAS LIQUID, I TRIED TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE WHERE THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM. DPS AND WFD PUT ON SAFETY GEAR SO THEY COULD GET CLOSE TO THE TRUCK. I ASKED THEM TO GET THE PRESSURE IN THE TANK AND TO DESCRIBE WHERE THE FUEL WAS COMING FROM. THE DESCRIPTION THEY GAVE WAS DESCRIBING THE 3 1/4 ACME FILL VALVE. IT WAS DETERMINED THE LEAK COULD NOT BE STOPPED. I THEN HAD THE SERVICE MAN TAKE THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK TO THE HOSPITAL TO BE CHECKED OUT. THEN I CALLED PERS TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE INCIDENT. THEY TOLD ME TO CALL THE STATE AND FEDERAL DEPT. TO MAKE A REPORT WITH THEM. I NOTIFIED THE FEDERAL BUT THE STATE OFFICE WAS CLOSED. DURING THIS TIME THE FIRE DEPT WAS EVACUATING PEOPLE AND SHUTTING OFF ANY SOURCE OF IGNITION. OUR OFFICE WAS CONTACTING A LOCAL HOTEL FOR ROOMS FOR ANYONE WHO WAS EVACUATED AND NEEDED A ROOM. THE RED CROSS WAS SETTING UP TO HELP WHEREVER THEY COULD.  AFTER APPROX. 4 HOURS, A DPS HAZMAT OFFICER CAME UP TO ME WITH AN AIR QUALITY METER. I HAD BINOCULARS AND I WANTED TO SEE A FROST LINE ON THE TRUCK TANK TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH GAS WAS IN THE TANK.  I ASKED HIM HOW CLOSE HE COULD GET ME TO THE TRUCK AND HE WALKED ME UP CLOSE TO THE TRUCK. I COULD THEN SEE THAT THE LEAK WAS A VAPOR LEAK AND IT WAS LEAKING FROM THE TOP OF THE VAPOR ELIMINATOR I EXPLAINED TO A FIREFIGHTER WHICH VALVE TO SHUT OFF TO STOP THE LEAK. ONCE CLOSED THE LEAK STOPPED. I THEN MET WITH THE HAZMAT OFFICERS. I LET THEM KNOW IT WAS SAFE TO TURN THE TRUCK BACK UP ON ITS WHEELS AFTER I INSPECTED THE TRUCK AND THE PIPING TO BE SURE ALL WAS SAFE. THE HAZMAT HAD US WAIT ANOTHER HALF HOUR TO LET THE AREA AIR OUT BEFORE WE COULD MOVE THE TRUCK. WE THEN CALLED THE TOW TRUCK OUT AND HAD OUR OTHER DRIVER BRING OUT AN EMPTY BOBTAIL TO PUMP OVER THE FUEL.","THE ONLY THING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IS THE TRAINING AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE EMERGENCY PERSONNEL.

An emergency response crew was immediately called.  Upon arrival to the site, the crew determined that one   55-gallon drum of Epoxy UF paint was leaking due to a pinhole in the body of the drum.  This drum was immediately overpacked in an 85-gallon salvage drum.  The crew then placed granular sorbents down to absorb all the free product on the trailer floor and the asphalt under the trailer.  These were then swept up and placed in a 55-gallon drum for disposal.  The saturated pallet was also cut up and placed in the same 55-gallon drum for disposal.    The other two drums on the pallet were not leaking.  One was severely dented and was also placed into an 85-gallon salvage drum and the other was accepted by the consignee.  From the initial call for an emergency response crew to the final staging of the disposal drums, the time duration was 4.5 hours.",A recommendation will be made to all shippers and drivers to inspect their load prior to shipment.

WIRAM,ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES DIRECTOR,3111 North Post Road,INDIANAPOLIS,IN,46226,Facility,"On 1-18-06 at 0735, during a routine pre-operational inspection, Ulrich personnel detected a slight chlorine gas leak in railcar #GATX 44537.  This car had been received into Ulrich’s facility on 1-17-06.  Initial investigation revealed that the leak was originating from under the railcar valve/man-way located on top of the car.  However, due to the car construction, visual verification of the exact location and extent of damage could not be determined.  At 0755 (1-18-06), Ulrich personnel determined that an in-house hazmat response was not feasible, since the exact location of the leak could not be confirmed. Therefore, Occidental Chemical Corporation (OXY) was contacted for   assistance.  OXY dispatched personnel from their Niagara Falls facility and began the process of dispatching Specialty Response Solutions (SRS) hazmat team from Fort Worth, Texas.  At 1000 (1-18-06), Ulrich personnel met with the Terre Haute Fire Department (THFD) to establish a contingency plan in case the incident should escalate.  THFD agreed to implement the following:  (1). Notify surrounding schools of potential for sheltering-in-place of students and faculty; (2). Coordinate with the Terre Haute Transit Authority to provide city buses in case an evacuation was deemed necessary; (3). Briefed the Terre Haute Police Department and (4). Placed department hazmat responders on stand-by for assisting Ulrich personnel if needed.  At 1030 (1-18-06), Ulrich personnel began offloading the railcar, without air padding, into ton containers.  This decreased the overall quantity of chlorine and reduce internal pressure within the railcar.  Between 1040-1112 (1-18-06), the LEPC, SERC and NRC was notified of the incident. At 1500 (1-18-06), arranged with Canadian Pacific Railroad for an empty chlorine railcar (#HOKX 132247) to be moved from their switch yard and re-spotted within Ulrich’s facility.  At 2130 (1-18-06) OXY personnel arrived and were briefed on current status.  Rate of release has not increased and the incident has been stable since 0735.  Decision was made to tighten the bolts on the man-way flange in an attempt to resolve incident.  Applied 750 foot-pounds to each man-way bolt and monitored for improvement.  No improvement was observed, railcar continued to slightly leak product.  At 2300 (1-18-06), the decision was made to shutdown the transferring operation from railcar to ton containers and secure the area.  Ulrich personnel remained on-site over-night to monitor the railcar.  At 0930 (1-19-06), SRS arrived at facility and was briefed on current status of incident.  The following incident response objectives were established:  (1). Railcar #HOKX 132247 will be degassed into Ulrich’s onsite chlorine scrubber system to decrease the internal pressure to approximately 30 psi.  This will allow chlorine to be transferred from leaking car; (2). Trans-load chlorine from car #GATX 44537 to #HOKX 132247 and (3). Prepare car #GATX 44537 for shipment back to OXY Chemical.

The plastic tubs had fallen over while being transported between the generator and the Stericycle facility.  The tubs fell over due to improper loading.  The tubs were not stacked tightly in the trailer.  The leakage was the result of improper packaging (bags were not used in all the containers).      The containers were stacked on the dock at the facility as they were removed from the trailer.  The leakage was absorbed using absorbant pads.  The trailer floor was cleaned and disinfected using a bleach/water solution.  There was little cost involved in the cleanup of the spill.

During No 211s trip North they had to make a stop at Kidders which is located approximately 2.20 miles North of Searsport. While stopped at Kidders the Conductor noticed that the side of GATX 15252, diesel fuel, was wet below the dome area of the car.  Furher inspection by the Conductor determined that some product had been seeping from the dome area of the car sometime during recent movement, however it was not seeping at this time and it appeared none had reached the ground.  The car was set off at Kidders for further inspection. On January 11, 2006 Irving Oil Company employees changed the dome gasket which was cracked.  Inspection of the ground in different areas between Mile 2.20 and the Irving Terminal at Searsport did not indicate that any product reached the ground during seepage.  The loss of product was minimal and hard to determine. Less than a gallon of seepage was estimated by railroad personnel with none actually reaching the ground.",,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway",US,

Walnut,WASHINGTON,IN,47501,Carrier,"Driver was northbound on SR45 and upon entering a left-hand curve, he got too wide and got off the road on the outside of the curve.  The soil apron along the highway was soft due to above normal temperatures and rain earlier in the month.  Once the tractor and trailer were off the pavement, driver could not pull them back onto the roadway.  The ground sloped down and away from the roadway about 4 or 5 feet.  The slope away from the roadway caused the tractor-trailer to lean and rollover, finally coming to rest with the tractor on its wheels and the trailer laying on its right side.  The twisting action on the trailer caused small leaks in the tank barrel and piping.  Immediately the responding fire department helped the driver then proceeded to plug, absorb or collect any spilled product in containers.  Upon Frette Energy's arrival on the scene with another tractor-trailer, all product from the wrecked vehicle was transferred into another trailer and the fuel from the tractor saddle tank was transferred into the other trailer.  Pads and booms were placed at the entry into a culvert to prevent any product from entering and thereby prohibiting the product from migrating under SR45 and into the soil.",All company employees were required to attend a mandatory meeting on the next business day to update them on the facts of the incident and to remind them of the basic properties of liquid transport and tanker rollover potential as well as company policies in reference to all safety rules.  The tractor and trailer had current inspections and the equipment was maintained properly.

WHEN THE RAIL CAR REACHED THE INTENDED LOADED WEIGHT, THE AUTOMATIC LOADING SYSTEM SHUT DOWN THE LOADING PUMPS, AND SIGNALED THE RAIL CAR LOADING LINE SHUT-OFF VALVE TO CLOSE.  SHORTLY AFTERWARD, A TRUCK DRIVER STARTED LOADING AMMONIA.  THE RAIL CAR LOAD LINE AND THE TRUCK LOADING LINE SHARE A COMMON HEADER.  EACH LINE IS EQUIPPED WITH A SHUT-OFF VALVE THAT ALLOWS LOADING FROM EITHER LINE OR BOTH.  THE SHUT-OFF VALVES ARE AIR OPERATED, AND CLOSE WHEN THE ACTUATOR OPENS THE EXHAUST LINE, WHICH IS A 1/4-INCH STAINLESS TUBING LINE.  DURING THE LOADING OF A TRUCK, THE RAIL CAR OVERFILLED, AND THE RAIL CAR RELIEF VALVE OPENED, RELEASING A CLOUD OF AMMONIA VAPOR.  THE CLOUD EXTENDED TO THE CONTROL ROOM.  THE OPERATORS ACTIVATED THE LOADING AREA EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN SYSTEM FROM THE CONTROL ROOM, SHUTTING OFF ALL LOADING.  THE RAIL CAR RELIEF VALVE RESEATED ITSELF, AND THE VAPOR CLOUD QUICKLY DISSIPATED.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR OTHER PERSONNEL IMPACTS FROM THE INCIDENT.  THE AMOUNT OF THE RELEASE WAS 1,400 POUNDS.  THE MITIGATION MEASURES AND RAPID RESPONSE ACTIONS TAKEN PREVENTED SIGNIFICANT IMPACT BEYOND WHAT DID OCCUR.  NEITHER THE TRUCK DRIVER NOR THE ON-SITE OPERATORS WERE AFFECTED BY THE AMMONIA RELEASE.  THE INCIDENT DID RESULT IN A BRIEF SHELTER-IN-PLACE FOR THE OPERATING CREW UNTIL THE AMMONIA CLUD DISSIPATED.  THE RELEASE WAS REPORTED TO THE STATE AGENCIES AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.  IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE AIR EXHAUST TUBE ON THE RAIL CAR SHUT-OFF VALVE WAS PLUGGED WITH ICE.  THE UNIT WAS TAKEN TO THE SHOP FOR INSPECTION.  ONCE THE ICE PLUG WAS REMOVED, THE PNEUMATIC SYSTEM OPERATED NORMALLY, AS DESIGNED.  MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE ICE PLUG WAS THE FREEZING FOG IN THE AREA THAT MORNING.  DURING THE SUBSEQUENT INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IF THE AIR IS NOT EXHAUSTED FROM THE VALVE ACTUATOR, THE VALVE CAN FAIL TO CLOSE.  AT THE TIME, WERE NO MEANS IN PLACE TO VERIFY THAT THE LOAD LINE VALVE HAD CLOSED ONCE THE LOAD SYSTEM WAS SHUT DOWN.  IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION ARE TO REPLACE THE 1/4-INCH TUBING WITH A LARGER OPENING, TO HELP REDUCE POSSIBLE PLUGGING FROM ICE.  LONG-TERM CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE TO INSTALL A SYSTEM THAT ALARMS OPERATIONS WHEN THE VALVE FAILS TO CLOSE, AND WHCIH IS EQUIPPE3D WITH AN AUTOMATIC INTERLOCK THAT SHUTS DOWN THE LOADING PUMPS UNTIL THE VALVE ON THE IDLE LINE IS CLOSED.  BECAUSE LARGER TUBING COULD RESULT IN OTHER CAUSES OF BLOCKAGE, IT WILL BE REPLACED WITH A 1/4-INCH STANDARD SIZE AT THAT TIME.","IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS ARE TO REPLACE THE 1.4 INCH TUBING WITH A LARGER OPENING, TO HELP REDUCE POSSIBLE PLUGGING FROM ICE.

WHEN THE AIR ACTUATOR VALVE AUTOMATICALLY CLOSED AT APPROXIMATELY 6:30 PM, THE PRESSURE IN THE TANK CAUSED THE LEAK TO INCREASE IN VOLUME.  THE PRESSURE INCREASED IN THE TANKER BECAUSE THE UNLOADING PROCESS HAD STOPPED.  THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE LOCATED ON THE TOP OF THE TANKER RELEASED PRESSURE.  THIS ALERTED THE DRIVER AND THE OPERATOR THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND THEY NOTICED THE AIR ACTUATOR VALVE HAD CLOSED AND THAT THE LEAK HAD INCREASED IN VOLUME.  A PLANT OPERATOR PLACED A LARGER CONTAINER UNDER THE LEAK AND CALLED THE LEE COUNTY HAZMAT EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM.  THE DRIVER DOUBLE CHECKED ALL OF HIS AIR CONNECTIONS AND DETERMINED THAT HE COULD NOT REOPEN THE AIR ACTUATOR VALVE.  AT THIS POINT, THE DRIVER DISCONNECTED THE UNLOADING HOSE.  A PLANT OPERATOR MOVED THE CONTAINER THAT WAS CATCHING THE ACID WITH A FORKLIFT AND THE DRIVER MOVED THE TRUCK TO THE CONTAINMENT AREA.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SITE, THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR, ACT WAS ABLE TO RELEASE THE PRESSURE IN THE TANK AND STOP THE LEAK.  THE REMAINING MATERIAL IN THE TANKER WAS OFF LOADED INTO ANOTHER TANK ON SITE.  THE SPILLED MATERIAL HAD BEEN CAPTURED IN THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT FOR THE LOADING DOCK.  THE MATERIAL WAS RELEASED INTO THE CAPE CORAL WATER TREATMENT FACILITY WHERE IT WAS NEUTRALIZED AND RELEASED TO THE LOCAL POTW.  THE CONCRETE AREAS THAT WERE IMPACTED WERE RINSED WITH ALL RESIDUE.  FROM THE TIME THE ER CONTRACTOR ARRIVED ON SITE TO THE DISCARGE OF THE NEUTRALIZED MATERIAL, THE DURATION WAS APPROXIMATELY 12 HOURS.  WHAT CAUSED THE ACCIDENT?  LOOSE U-BOLT.  THE U-BOLT THAT HOLDS THE OUTLET PIPE AND OUTLET VALVE TO THE BRACKET WAS LOOSE, ALLOWING IT TO MOVE AND PUT STRESS ON THE WELD CAUSING A PINHOLE LEAK.  ROOT CAUSE:  INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE INSPECTION AND/OR MONITORING.","IN ADDITION TO THE PRE-TRIP AND POST-TRIP INSPECTIONS THAT ARE PERFORMED BY THE DRIVERS, A CERTIFIED MECHANIC WILL CONDUCT WEEKLY MECHANICAL INSPECTIONS ON THE TANKERS AND TRUCKS.

DRIVER THEN CONNECTED HIS VAPOR HOSES TO THE VAPOR RECOVERY ON THE REGULAR AND PREMIUM TANKS.  THE DRIVER STUCK THE TANKS AND ALONG WITH THE VEEDER-ROOT DETERMINED THAT HE HAD SPACE FOR 9000 GALLONS IN THE PREMIUM TANK AND MORE THAN 5000 GALLONS IN EACH OF THE REGULAR TANKS.  THE DRIVER THEN CONNECTED HIS DELIVERY HOSE TO FIRST THE REGULAR TANK AND THEN TO THE PREMIUM TANK AND STARTED HIS DELIVERY.  WHEN THE DRIVER TURNED AWAY FROM THE PREMIUM TANK, HE HEARD A SOUND COMMING FROM THE FILL THAT GO HIS ATTENTION.  HE TURNED BACK AROUND TO FIND GAS STREAMING OUT FROM THE PLUNGER AREA IN THE CONTAINMENT WELL.

When he turned on the pump, the driver noticed that the pump sounded like it was restricted. The pump itself has a T design. A hose was connected to one side and the other side had a steel cap on it. When the pump became restricted it blew the cap off the other side and allowed product to come out of the pump. The product flow was immediately shut off and the pump turned off. Approximately 50 gallons of product was spilled on the asphalt lot.

The driver of the truck reported that after stopping for a break at a gas station in Ozark, Arkansas, he inspected his truck prior to resuming his trip. Upon inspection at approximately 2 AM, he noticed a liquid leaking from the back tailgate of the truck. After observing the leak, he contacted Chemtrec who in turn contacted Nucor. A representative of Nucor immediately contacted the National Reporting Center (NRC), the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management (ADEM) and the Arkansas State Police to report the suspected release. The truck was in transit from Nucor’s facility in Blytheville, Arkansas to a disposal facility in Lone Mountain, Oklahoma owned by Clean Harbors, Inc.    Response:  The driver’s immediate response to the leak was to tighten turn buckles on the tailgate to increase the pressure on the tailgate gaskets. The driver reported that after tightening turn buckles, a small drip was still present. After reporting the release to officials, Nucor contacted HEPACO emergency response contractors based in Little Rock, AR. They immediately dispatched a crew to the site of the release. Upon arrival, they assessed that the situation was safe and posed no danger to the public. They applied absorbent material inside of the truck trailer to absorb any free liquids. Once the free liquids had been absorbed, the trailer’s tailgate was opened for inspection. After representatives from Nucor arrived to inspect the truck, the tailgate was closed and secured. Protective plastic sheeting was placed on the ground to ensure no EAF dust came in contact with the ground. After inspection, the sheeting was rolled up and placed in with the EAF dust for disposal.    Suspected Cause:  The EAF dust normally has no free liquids in it, but apparently the vibration from the truck caused some condensed moisture in the dust to settle to the bottom of the truck trailer and collect near the tailgate. Normally gaskets on the trailer’s tailgate would prevent any liquids from leaking from the trailer. However, once the tailgate was open for inspection, it was observed that a piece of plastic liner that is placed in the bottom of the trailer to aid with removal of the EAF dust from the trailer at the disposal site had become wrinkled and lodged between the gasket of the trailer bed and the gasket on the trailer tailgate. This small gap allowed the collected free liquids to leak from the trailer past the gaskets.    Corrective Action:  In addition to the absorbent material placed in the trailer, the wrinkled plastic was folded up out of the gasket’s pathway and attached with a peg to the plastic above it to ensure it did not fall between the gaskets upon closing the tailgate. The tailgate was closed and a proper seal of the gaskets was visually ensured","A letter was sent to all trucking companies on December 12th, 2006 that have hauled hazardous material in end dumps asking them to instruct their drivers on proper inspection of tailgate gasket prior to loading.",No,HOPPER,Highway hopper trailer for solid materials only,HOPPER T,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6513,Nucor Steel- Arkansas,US,

TRANSPORT REGULATIONS & FLEET SAFETY,39 OLD RIDGEBURY RD,DANBURY,CT,06810,Shipper,"At about 5:30 am on Sunday 1/15/06 a mobile acetylene trailer system (MATS) left 1-70 (eastbound) near milepost 136 in Columbia, MO, proceeded down an embankment and overturned, coming to rest against the bank of a small creek. A fire involving the MATS ensued and consumed the residual acetylene in the cylinders through fusible metal plugs that released acetylene from the cylinderrs, which remained with the trailer. The driver of the vehicle suffered fatal injuries although it is unclear whether a medical event occurred prior to the accident and contributed to the vehicle leaving the roadway.    The tractor trailer was driven by a team of drivers for Logex and was returning an empty residual acetylene trailer from a customer in Perry, Iowa to the Taft (Hahnville) acetylene trailer filling facility of Praxair Distribution Inc (“PDI”). The road is a long, straight road that has a slight downhill grade. Prior to mile post 136 on interstate 70 heading eastbound just east of Columbia, MO, the tractor trailer left the road where the road curves slightly to the left and has a slight downhill grade. The passenger tires left the right side of the roadway followed 105 later by the driver side wheels. There was no indication that the driver applied his brakes or attempted to turn for the curve. The second driver who was in the sleeper cab at the time the vehicle left the roadway stated that, he heard a noise and woke up to find that he was staring at the ground. He was able to free himself from the netting in the sleeper compartment and crawl free of the wreckage.",NO COMMENT PROVIDED,No,CYLINDER,Steel for acetylene,8,No,,,,,,,206,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,92000,PRAXAIR INC.,US,

He was using a forklift with a Wesco® Drum Grab attached.  After successfully unloading a number of drums, the Drum Grab punctured the wall of a 55-gallon drum.  Bob did not see the puncture, but heard the splash as material spilled onto the bed of the trailer.  Bob called for Patrick Cope, Material Handler.  Patrick placed the damaged drum on a spill containment pallet and moved that drum/pallet outside.  Around the same time, Rick Burns, Jr., Process Specialist, happened upon the scene and provided assistance.  Around 16:30, Dave Lawson, Materials Planning Manager, and Norman Umberger, EHS Manager, was paged and responded to the scene.  An assessment of the situation was made and unloading/cleanup operations were halted.    Cleanup:    Rick initially entered the trailer without respiratory protection.  Norman identified the drum as containing ethyl acetate 99% (VE0022).  Norman collected information on ethyl acetate from the MSDS, the label, websites (EPA, NIOSH, OSHA, others), Ashland, Chemtrek, NEMF, and NIOSH pocket guide.  The primary hazard posed by Ethyl Acetate is flammability.  Ethyl Acetate evaporates rapidly which can accelerate the generation of an explosive atmosphere in closed spaces.  In addition, the vapor is heavier than air and can travel along the ground and accumulate in low points.    A toxic gas monitor was used to test the air inside the trailer and it was found to be above the 10% of the lower explosive limit (LEL), which is the level that OSHA considers potentially explosive.  At that time, cleanup operations were halted and the trailer was allowed to air out.    After determining how to clean up the spill, safely and effectively, Rick and Norm conducted the cleanup that day and into the next day.      Rick wore an SCBA when entering the trailer to take measurements with the toxic gas monitor and when moving, by hand, the drums around the trailer to allow for the ethyl acetate on the floor to evaporate.    Several spill control items—adsorbent “socks” and loose adsorbent—were used in the cleanup.  They were primarily to contain the material, that is prevent the ethyl acetate from leaving the trailer     Environmental Damage:    Environmental damage was minimal and was minimized through the swift actions of Rick, Bob, and Patrick.  The spill was contained within the facility and the trailer.  Approximately ten to twenty gallons were lost.  Ethyl Acetate has a low vapor pressure, so it all evaporated.    No hazardous material reached a waterway, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, or the ground.",Internal Recommendations:    Package drums on pallets.  Status: Contacted Ashland and they agree to instruct loaders to palletize future shipments.    Exercise care at all times.  Status: Ongoing.  Spoke with all employees.

Operator for tank UTCU45O1 290 is APL, booking 503133963, Shipper Stolt Nielsen % Celanese booked on the SL Motivator. Commodity Combustible Liquid Nos (Nonanol), NA 1993, PG III, Flash point 74C, 5740 gallons, 39560lbs  POHA Fire Department responded immediately. I notified M&M Protection Services our Emergency Response Vendor.  The crane operator had loaded all 2Oft containers on the forward end of hatch 4, including UTCU45O1 290. The crane moved back to load the aft end port to starboard While loading box 5 SAMU21 86477, the corner of the box came in contact with the valve on the tank causing itto leak.SAMU2186477 SAMU container was not damaged.  The tank was lifted off the vessel. Sonny Moody the walking foreman advised everyone in that area of hatch 4 to get off the dock and away from under the crane. POHA put absorbent down on the dock under the crane and land side. This assisted in absorbing the odor. The tank was placed on the dock on CS apprx. between 5200-5300 marker on the landside behind the crane legs. The area under the crane was opened apprx. 2030 hrs up for traffic movement but no employees were allowed to work hatch 4 as it had to be cleaned. The area from row 5 Z to the crane leg was shut off to traffic Friday night. We continued to work in hatch 8 apprx. 200 ft away.  Five flatbeds were stacked and the tank was leaned up against the flatbeds at a 45 degree angle using the Paceco crane. The tank was secured with chains to the flatbed.  A popup pool was placed on the top flat for the product to leak into. Absorbent was placed on the ground (concrete). Apprx 30 or less gallons leaked onto the dock.  Apprx 50 gallons leaked on the vessel. Most of the product was contained on the hatch cover. Some product had spilled on the walk ways. POHA Fire Depart and M&M representative conducted a inspection on the vessel. Sixteen containers had to be discharged off the vessel in order to clean off the hatch cover. The walking foreman unlashed the containers. He was supplied information regarding the product and a respirator. Absorbent pads were used to clean up the spill on the vessel. Two fire extinguishers were made available for use if needed. The chemical reacted with the pads. The pads were placed in drums. We used the water keg on the vessel at the gangway and pouired water in the drums to stop them from smoking. The product specialist advised when we completed the cleanup to put absorbent in the drums and pour copious amounts of water in the drum, which we did. We met with the chief mate on the vessel who approved the clean up. The tank was inspected and the nuts tightened again. The leak was down to a slow drip. The cool temperatures helped in keeping the product from expanding. We completed the cleanup appx. 3:30 a.m. on 1/7/05. There were six drums of clean up materials for disposaL",EMPLOYEE WAS COUNSELED TO BE MORE CAREFUL AND MAKE SURE CONTAINER IS STRAIGHT BEFORE LANDING.
