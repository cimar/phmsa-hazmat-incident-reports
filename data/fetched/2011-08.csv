I went to investigate the leaking car and found that product was coming from the protective relief device when the car was moved.  I called Chemtrec at 0909 hrs to notify shipper and report the leak.  They gave me report #2011020200041.  Darren Smith from the shipper, Aventine, called at 0921 to ask what the problem was and I told him and he said to call the contractor of our choice to handle the problem.  I called SunPro at 0943 to come see if maybe the O rings needed replaced in the PRD.  I then called Don McDonald of the Stark LEPC at 1030 just to let him know what was going on and that we didn’t need his assistance.  SunPro arrived at 1030 and after we investigated, we found that the top portion of the valve could be operated up and down by hand meaning that the interior spring of the device had broken.   We removed from the breadbox seal #0261043 and replaced with seal #486.  We removed from the manway cover seal #0261044 and it also had writing on the back which said LS1112 and we replaced this seal with #475.   I called Roger Spring at Marathon to see if they would receive the car for offloading so we didn’t have to transfer it.  He said he would call the Canton plant to see.  He asked that I call the FRA to see if it would be ok to make that move.  I spoke to the FRA in Washington adn they said we could make that move providing that wedge the PRD shut so it wouldn’t open in transit so could it could  move into the refinery for offloading. The pressure relief device will be replaced by UTLX on the repair track at the refinery and then a movement approval will be gotten so the car to move to the UTLX home shop on Marion, Ohio.",NO COMMENT PROVIDED,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

All required local and state notifications were made. Oregon DEC Report#2011-1935","At the time the driver accepted the container for transportation, no evidence of leaking was observed. The driver, however, was re-instructed to conduct a  thorough inspection of each container before acceptance and if any evidence of a reduction in structural integrity is found to take appropriate action to  either place the container into a suitable salvage drum or re containerize before transportation is initiated. Offloading employee is recieving additional training.  In addition, Clean Harbors spoke with the customer regarding this incident and they were also concerned that there was some liquid in the waste product shipped by their employees. They held a training session with their crew regarding proper container selection, UN ratings, and what material is acceptable in what type of container.

The responder properly secured all manway securement bolts. Afterwards, UTLX 210295 was moved and the responder observed product still sloshing out from the manway closure which is indicative of a manway gasket not sealing properly. Movement of UTLX 5210295 was stopped again and with the assistance from another BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder, the condition of the manway gasket was inspected. The fiber manway gasket installed was found compressed thus losing its sealing ability. A new manway gasket was installed and the responders properly resecured the manway closure.

Shannon Schick (Hazmat Manager) and Steve Torres (Bulk Safety Director) were immediately notified.  It was quickly determined that product was loaded on a wrong trailer type (corrosive product & aluminum trailer) and was having a slow reaction that would slowly build pressure and release product and vapors every couple of minutes through the pressure vent when it reached 30 psi. The vent itself had no failure but it was the selected choice a few screens back as nothing else seemed to fit any closer.  We cleared out our tankwash personnel and then had the trailer brought into the wash bay which had ample containment for any uncontained releases.  Roughly 5 gallons had spilled out from the dome before we were able to get it in our tankwash bay.  Chemtrec and the Louisiana State Police were then notified.      Chemtrec - 20110825000008  State Police Reporting - 11-05182    The ER Contractor we hired (EH&S care of ERTS)arrived on scene and was briefed.  We used the exisiting pressure on the trailer to bring it to neutral atmoshphere before opening the air inlet to proceed with using a pump for the product transfer.  Opening the air inlet was to ensure we didnt collapse the trailer while performing the pump unload.  When the transfer was complete the contractor then used soda ash to neutralize the material and absorbants.  The area outside was excavated and removed from site.  I put in the value of product on the prior screen assuming the product is not usable after going through the reaction.  I also entered the current trailer value (if we are going to scrap it) but we are still trying to determine whether the trailer will be fixable enough to use for training purposes.,"1. The computer system we are using does not automatically flag corrosive materials to not be able to load in aluminum trailers.  Now a report is being generated daily & our IT Department will be entering trailer requirements for any corrosive commodity that does not have the right requirements associated to it.    2. Trailer numbering sequence.  All of our older aluminum trailer were under 202 numbers (ex - 20292, 20295, etc).  Our new aluminum trailers are under a numbering sequence such as (28477, 28095,etc) which is consistent with the numbering for our stainless steel insulated trailers.  The numbering system for our aluminum trailers will recieve a new numbering sequence to help eliminated confusion    3.

The intermodal flatcar that MEDU 412126 was riding atop was setout of the train and isolated on a repair track for further investigation. A crane removed MEDU 412126 from its top double-stacked position and grounded it in an area for responders to open container and investigate the odor source. After removal of all 78 drums inside MEDU 412126, the responders reported finding only one leaking 55 gallon poly drum found towards the front of the container. This drum was punctured by a floor deck nail at its bottom head. This leaking drum was placed inverted into an overpack drum with the nail hole covered, which was then properly labeled and sealed. The interior spillage within MEDU 412126 was neutralized and cleaned.

A BNSF hazardous material responder immediately inspected GATX 29543 finding the leak source at both reclosing 75 psig pressure relief valves (PRV). The ambient temperatures at this time were at or above 105 degrees F. All spillage was rapidly evaporating. The responder determined that the PRV liquid releases were due to an overfilled (by volume) condition. GATX 29543 was carefully isolated in the railyard for product reduction by contract responders. Product was off-loaded into three 250 gallon sized totes without further incident. The product filled totes were delivered to the nearby consignee for contaminate testing and acceptance.

An emergency response team was called in to stand by and assist with transferring the product to another cargo tank.,"A proper visual inspection by the tankwash and then by driver and loading personnel, should have detected the issue with the internal valve not seated properly unless it became misaligned during transit.  It's very unusual to have issues with the internal and external valves.  The trailer was brought into the shop after it was cleaned to be inspected.

Due to the unsecure dome lid approximately 5 gallons of UN1866 Formaldehye Resin released onto the asphalt parking lot. No storm drains, waterways or soils were impacted as a result of this release. Quality Carriers contacted ERTS on August 16, 2011 to manage this incident. ERTS dispatched Environmental Management Services to the site to investigate the release further. Environmental Management Services personnel arrived on site and reported that the material had dried to the surface and no additional remediation could be done short of removing the asphalt.

WHEN THE OPERATOR CRACKED THE UNLOADING VALVE ON THE CAR OPEN, AMMONIA STARTED LEAKING FROM THE HAMMER UNION.  THE OPERATOR EVACUATED THE AREA WITHOUT CLOSING THE VALVE DUE TO THE LEAK.

WE INSTALLED A NEW GASKET IN THE FITTING AND RECONNECTED THE HOSE AND UNLOADED THE CAR WITHOUT ANY FURTHER ISSUES.  NOTE:  THE TANK CAR AND ITS VALVES WERE NEVER THE ISSUE, THE LEAK WAS DUE TO A MISSING GASKET ON OUR UNLOADING HOSE FITTING. THE DURATION OF THE LEAK WAS 40 MINUTES.","THE OPERATOR WAS COUNSELED ABOUT HIS FAILURE TO FOLLOW WRITTEN PROCEDURES REQUIRING HIM TO CHECK FOR A GOOD GASKET IN THE HOSE FITTINGS.

It was reported that approximately 15 gallons of material released from a 15 gallon plastic drum, which was punctured by a nail on the pallet. ERTS dispatched ES&H to the site to investigate the release and begin clean up operations. The contractor arrived on site and placed the proper Level B suits on to investigate the release and begin clean up operations. The contractor utilized a fork lift on site to remove the cargo on the trailer to access the released material. The damaged tote was placed into a overpacked drum prior to the environmental contractor's arrival. The contractor reported that the material had almost completely evaporated prior to their arrival. ES&H personnel neutralized the material and then cleaned up the impacted trailer floor utilizing absorbents. Three damaged boxes were also containerized for disposal along with the suits utilized by ES&H personnel. Seven drums of waste were generated from clean up activities and were transported off site for disposal.

It was reported that approximately 10 gallons of paint was released due to a loose valve on a tote. The driver reported that the valve came loose, which resulted in the released material. The driver secured the valve to stop the tote from leaking. ERTS dispatched Custom Environmental to the site to investigate the release and begin clean up operations. Custom Environmental personnel utilized a fork lift to move the totes on the trailer to access the impacted trailer floor. The contractor scaped the material from the impacted trailer floor and containerized the waste for disposal. The paint was also removed from the impacted dirt parking lot. One 55 gallon drum of waste was generated from clean up activities and was transported for disposal.

Hunt Corporate Drive,Lowell,AR,72745,Carrier,"Load was booked into JB Hunts system as non-hazardous.  Load contained a non-placarded quantity of mixed limited quantity and conventional hazmat; 1801 lbs of UN1044 ltd qty, 75 lbs of UN3266 and 34 lbs of UN1013.  Shipper mistakenly handed driver flammable placards; the load did not contain any flammable materials.  Driver failed to call in to perform a hazmat briefing; he did not review his shipping papers and did not recognize the problem even when he had been provided with placards.  Because no briefing was performed, no EDI hazmat shipping paper was provided to the railcarrier, Norfolk Southern in Atlanta, GA.  When the error was brought to JBH attention, the driver and fleet manager who performed the briefing fielding the data for EDI transmission to the railroad, failed to input the data correctly - user did not select entry from a dropdown menue for ""limited quantity.""  This falsely showed the load as requiring dangersous placards, when in fact no placards were required, providing false information to the rail carrier.  Ad hoc transmission of EDI data also failed to transmit contract holder data for the emergency contact field; this issue has been resolved by JBH IT.","JBH Compliance has recommended additional training to sales & marketing personnel to better ensure loads containing hazmat will be booked as hazmat loads, requiring the driver to perform a hazmat briefing.  Additional training and oversight has been recommended to operations personnel who perform these briefings to be sure they understand what is meant by a ""limited quantity"" and will be sure to enter the data correctly.  Because briefings are performed verbally, the goalkeeper in his scenario is the driver; drivers will be reminded to be sure to mention anytime a limited quantity hazardous material is present to provide the full description when fielding the data.  Increased auditing has also been recommended to better ensure accountability that the data is correctly fielded; this will be performed by comparing the EDI transmissions JBH provides with the hard copy BOLs provided by shippers.",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,J.B.

Contract responders replaced the o-ring on the thermowell stem on 8/19/2011. The o-ring removed didn't appear damaged, but had hardened which prevented a good tight seal when the thermowell closure cap was in place. Afterwards, no further product release was observed during monitoring of UTLX 201217. The internal thermometer well pipe may be compromised. All other valves and fittings were secure.

THE VEHICLE WAS TRANSPORTING TWO FUELED MISSILES (UN0392, ROCKET MOTORS, LIQUID FUELED, 1.3J) IN CNU-308 NAVY-ISSUED CONTAINERS AS PART OF RAYTHEON'S NORMAL MAINTENANCE PROCESSES.  THE INCIDENT INVOLVED ONLY ONE CONTAINER.  PRIOR TO SHIPPING, THE SUBJECT MISSILE WENT THRU A MAINTENANCE PROCESS THAT INCLUDED DEFUELING THE MISSILE'S  TACTICLE PAYLOAD SECTION, REMOVING THE PAYLOAD/WARHEAD ASSEMBLY AND REPLACING THAT ASSEMBLY WITH A PAYLOAD SPACER.  THE OPERATOR PERFORMING THIS PROCESS FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT A TEMPORARY PAYLOAD ""SPACER"", CONTAINING A  PRECONFIGURED JUMPER HOSE THAT REROUTES FUEL BACK TO THE MISSILE, HAD NOT BEEN ISSUED.  INSTEAD A PRODUCTION SPACER, WITH JUMPER HOSE NOT CONFIGURED, HAD BEEN ISSUED.  AS A RESULT THE OPERATOR SELECTED THE INCORRECT WORK INSTRUCTION OPTION, WHICH OMITS THE ASSEMBLY TASK OF REROUTING A FUEL JUMPER HOSE.  WITHOUT THE CORRECT FUEL JUMPER CONFIGURATION, FUEL CAN SLOWLY TRANSFER FROM THE MISSILE INTO THE EMPTY PAYLOAD SECTION AND EVENTUALLY DRIP OUT OF THE MISSILE'S EXTERIOR WEEP HOLE INTO THE CNU-308 SHIPPING CONTAINER.  THE CNU-308 SHIPPING CONTAINER.  THE CNU-308 SHIPPING CONTAINER HAS TWO WEEP HOLES LOCARTED APPROX. 1/2"" ABOVE THE BOTTOM OF THE CONTAINER WHERE THE FUEL EVENTUALLY EXITED.  NO FUEL LEAK WAS NOTED DURING PACKAGING OR LOADING.  UPON ARRIVAL AT DESTINATION,  PRIOR TO UNLOADING, A LEAK FROM THE CNU-308 SHIPPING CONTAINER WAS OBSERVED.  RAYTHEON SECURITY AND SITE CONTRACT HAZMAT RESPONDERS WERE NOTIFIED AND A PERIMETER BOUNDARY WAS ESTABLISHED.  A LAYER OF AFFF FIRE-RETARDANT FOAM WAS APPLIED TO THE SPILL AND ABSORBENT SPILL CONTAINMENT TO PREVENT RUN-OFF WAS USED.  THE LEAKING UNIT WAS REMOVED FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER AND PLACED IN A DRY CONTAINER.  CLEANUP AND DECONTAMINATION OF THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER, VEHICLE AND ASPHALT WAS THEN COMPLETED, UTILIZING A THIRD-PARTY REMEDIATION CONTRACTOR.  THE UNIT WAS LATER DRAINED OF FUEL AND THE AMOUNT MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM SPILL QUANTITY OF NO MORE THAN 1/2 GALLON.","Immediately halted all inbound spacer installation activity and screened all inventory for correct configuration.  Completed a Safety Review Board and added an orange stenciled 'Payload Spacer Not for Production Use' marking to clearly identify non-production spacers.

Re-torqued all fuel jumper hose connections in temporary payload spacers and eliminated the use of the production payload spacer from the planning.

The TM re-reviewed the SSP for transferring sulfuric acid two weeks prior to the incident occurring.  2. The importance of immediately reporting incidents was recently discussed with all terminal personnel on the heels of a previous release.","ROOT CAUSES:  1. Employee did not ensure that the railcar was depressurized, per the SSP 3025-002, prior to opening the product cap.  Employee was in the habit of opening the product valve without relieving pressure from cars with a safety valve on the product line.   2. Employee was identified as learning better through repetition rather than by the SSP and was not properly monitored to ensure all necessary steps were followed to prevent incident.     CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  1. TM realigned loaders to ensure that a senior loader conducts acid transfers. A secondary loader will be assigned to ensure continuity and coverage.   2. Ensure employees are monitored and demonstrate proficiency in the task at hand prior to completing an Employee Demonstration Checklist and working unattended.   3.

(CCT) crew. BNSF mechanical responders placed a containment receptacle under FURX 120552 and investigated the leak source. The internal BOV's mounting flange plate was the location of the product leak. One Allen head mounting bolt was found loose and it was tool tightened which stopped the leak at 1750 hrs. PDT, 8/30/2011. FURX 120552 continued to be monitored and on 8/31/2011 at approximately 0800 hrs. PDT, another product leak developed at or near the same location as the previous leak. BNSF mechanical responders again retightened  the Allen head flange securement bolts to stop this secondary leak. A verbal FRA OTMA was granted to transport FURX 120552 approximately 1 1/2 miles to its unloading location. Representatives from the FRA (FRA Inspector Flores), BNSF and CCT deemed the movement of FURX 120552 safe and it was accomplished without further incident. Captured spillage was placed into a recovery drum for shipper arrangements for either disposal or recycling.     Afterwards, information received from the CCT indicated that FURX 120552 leaked again on 9/2/2011 and DOT 5800.1 incident report numbered E-2011090149 was filed by CCT for this occurrence on their property.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,860,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Train traffic in the area was stopped until vapor emissions ebbed. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder and contract responders inspected RCRX 1463 and reported product vapor emanating in an area of 12 to 18 inches around the vapor valve. Detailed inspection of the vapor valve revealed that the vapor valve's mounting flange gasket was damaged and protruding from the valve flange connection, preventing a good seal. The vapor valve's flange bolts were tool tight. A replacement gasket was installed and the vapor valve resecured. The vapor valve flange area was checked for any leakage and none observed. Seals BP 578 and BP 579 were applied. A neutralizing solution was sprayed onto all non-evaporated tank shell spillage.

Nearby BNSF personnel confirmed that AMCX 25813 was emanating a strong product odor. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder and contract responders inspected AMCX 25813. Responders reported that AMCX 25813's liquid valve had a small product leak at its threaded connection. Product spillage on AMCX 25813's side shell was evaporating and no product spillage impacted the ground. Detailed inspection of the liquid valve revealed that it was loose on its threaded connection, the valve itself was partially open, its closure plug was only hand tight and the valve stem was damaged (seized in an open position).  Inspection of the vapor valve revealed that it was partially open with its closure plug only hand tight and the valve stem also appeared damaged and inoperable. The responders tightened the liquid valve on its threaded connection and tool tightened the loose closure plugs by 2158 hrs. CDT, 8/24/2011. After this securement was completed, no further product leaks or odor was evident. The shipper was notified of the liquid and vapor valve deficiencies and AMCX 25813 was returned to the shipper's nearby loading location for corrective repairs.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,803,BNSF Railway Company,US,

AMCX 25801 was cordoned-off in the railyard. Contract responders inspected AMCX 25801 finding the leak source at the threaded liquid valve connection. The liquid valve was in its closed position, but was very loose on its threaded connection and its closure plug was not applied (but present lying within the valve hosing area). The vapor valve was found in its full open position, but its closure plug was tool tight and holding back vapor pressure. The responders closed the vapor valve.  The liquid valve and its closure plug were properly tool tightened on their threaded connections after additional Teflon tape applied to the threaded areas. Non-evaporated spillage on the side shell of AMCX 25801 was wiped. Micro-Blaze microbial treatment was applied atop spillage that impacted ballast as a bioremediation agent and odor reducer.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected NATX 37035 that resulted in an initial determination that NATX 37035 may be overfilled, as all valves and fittings appeared secure. Both NATX 37035 and the other rail car were carefully isolated in the railyard. A follow-up detailed inspection by a response contractor determined that the liquid valve on NATX 37035 was loose on its threaded connection and this was the source of the product leak.  The liquid valve's operating handle interfered with the full closure of the valve housing cover when the valve was fully tightened on its threaded connection; therefore the liquid valve was not tool tightened to accommodate the housing cover's closure. The responders tool tightened the liquid valve on its threaded connection and removed the liquid valve's operating handle. The valve handle was secured within the valve housing area. The contract responders steam cleaned both rail cars after plastic sheeting was laid under the rail cars to capture rinsed liquids and protect the ground.  NATX 37035's intact valve housing cover seal numbered 0000913 was replaced by seal BNSF 06157428.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4540,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The DAL Lead and Material Specialist were given copies of the departmental HAZMAT Handling Procedures and were reviewed in length with Stores Leadership to ensure the procedures were thoroughly understood.  The DAL Lead and Material Specialist were issued Letters of Instruction on 08/30/2011 that outlined the details of each individual's involvement in this HAZMAT event.

Attendance was taken at these events to ensure all DAL stores employees received the informational briefings in a timely manner.

The spilled product was placed in 2 clean plastic totes (275 gal), using clean shovels, and shop vac.

Loader input incorrect amount to be loaded into trailer into the meter, causing 12 gallons of Ethanol to be released.    AWARENESS ITEMS:   1. This release occurred on the second half of a split load.   2. The locks were not engaged on the scully.  3. Carrier’s certificate shows that they reduce compartments by 60 gallons as an additional safeguard, but this was not the case in this incident.  4. The scully was in the auto position; this was verified by the Terminal Manager and Director of Operations.   5. No red light was observed to indicate that there wasn’t a ground.  6. Ensure there are spill pans in place under the overflow tubes; depending on the configuration of the trailer they can be located in different places.","ROOT CAUSES:   1. Total amount to be transferred was 2050 gallons.  The 1st part of split was 598 gallons, leaving 1452 gallons to be transferred. The loaders were switched mid load and the second loader, by instinct, input total load amount versus the split amount.      CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:  1. A separate loader filled compartments 1-4 and part of 5. He was pulled off the load and another loader was used to complete the remainder of 5.   2. A faulty pump ground wire was confirmed by outside electrician. It is believed that this may have contributed to scully not operating properly.   3. Carrier’s certificate shows that they reduce compartments by 60 gallons as an additional safeguard, but this was not the case in this incident. The carriers probe was set to the highest level so they could Max out his compartment.     CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:   1. Loaders should never be changed mid load. This increases the potential for error to occur due to improper or misunderstood Instructions.   2. Raise awareness to ensure correct numbers of gallons are entered into meter, per SSP 3025-012.  3. Electricians called to investigate faulty ground.  Ground wire has since been repaired.   4. SSP needs to be updated to reflect that all safety devices must be locked and keys controlled by management.   5. Update 1642B to reflect scully must be locked at all times.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,TRANSFLO/Kinder Morgan,US,

The driver then loaded two empty (residual) onto the vehicle.  At this time he was distracted by a request from an Intel employee to pickup additional cylinders at another location within the Intel facility.  The driver proceeded to the truck and began to move when one of the two cylinders loaded fell from the rear of the vehicle as a reesult of the driver not strapping the cylinders in place.  The driver had been distracted from his normal routine.  The cylinder fell onto the valve protection cap, bending the base (neckring) to which the cap attaches.  The cap made contact with the valve, bending the valve at the point which it enters the cylinder body.  A barely audible release of the residual nitrogen occured.  The leak was at the piont that the cylinder valve enters the cylinder body.  The release of nitrogen at the slow rate lasted less than one hour.  As Nitrogen is an inert gas, no mitigation efforts were taken to stop the minor release.","The driver was immediately disqualified as a driver and was suspended pending investigation.  The driver subsequently resigned.    The cylinder involved in the incident was quarrantined and will be requalified and inspected prior to returning to use.  The damaged valve will be replaced as well as the neck ring.    Additional trainng and information will be provided to all drivers as a result of this incident, focusing on staying on routine and not allowing distractions to intervene with safety activities.  Drivers are adequately trained to properly secure cylinders and to not move vehicles without securing the lifgate in the fully up polsition.

Box 651,Andover,KS,67002,Facility,An employee was filling a 33lb Aluminum Forklift Cylinder with propane.  The filling nozzel came off of the filling valve of the cylinder and sprayed propane into the atmosphere.  The propane was ingnited and a fire ball ensued.  Cylinders started to explode and liquid propane burned.  The source of the propane was immdiately shut down and isolated.  The heat of the fire caused a large propane storage vessel to pop two 250 psi pressure relief valves and burn off a total of 11000 gallons of propane.,In this case all procedures described in NFPA58 guidelines were followed.  It appears as a faulty valve did not shut the filling nozzel off when removed from the fill valve.

The survey results were <.5 mrem/hr gamma on contact,< 2200 dpm/100cm2  beta-gamma smearable contamination, and < 220 dpm/100cm2  alpha smearable contamination.  .  On 8/19/2011intermodal waste containers # IM-026 and IM-049 were loaded on trailer# 3830067 and shipped to Clive, Utah for disposal. The shipment number was 0893-04-0395  .  The shipment was received by EnergySolutions (ES) on 8/22/2011 or  8/23/2011.  •  A ""return to service"" survey on trailer#  3830067 was performed and in addition to the requirements of 49 CFR 173.443 a direct frisk for beta­ gamma contamination was performed.  •  A 2""x2"" section of the wood on the trailer was found to be reading 77,000 dpm per direct frisk.  •  4 cloth disk smears were taken on the identified 2""x2"" section of the trailer and the results were < 66 dpm/100 cm2 smearable beta-gamma contamination and < 9 dpm/100 cm2 smearable alpha contamination.  •  Since the cloth disk smears did not remove the contamination, oily Masslinn cloth was used to wipe the identified 2""x2"" section. The Masslinn removed the contamination from the identified 2""x2"" section and the  reported result was 55,000 dpm/100cm2.","2) SPFM Corrective Action to Prevent a Recurrence of the Incident  .  SPFM is purchasing a Ludlum Model 239-1F Floor Monitor which will be used to survey all flatbed trailers for beta-gamma contamination destined for Clive, Utah.  •  Since the floor monitor will take 6 weeks for delivery, all trailers will be surveyed by direct frisk for beta-gamma contamination prior to loading waste containers.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,STUDSVIK-MEMPHIS,US,

Truck was headed down hill, navigated a left hand curve, at the exit of that curve, the downhill grade increases and then goes into a sharper right hand turn. The firefighters and CHP Officers on scene later informed me that his right hand curve is banked incorrectly, it banks to the left, and they have had several incidents there.  More than likely the driver was traveling too fast for conditions and his last minute attempts to brake as the road grade became steaper may have caused the liquid surge to increase or amplify just prior to entering the right hand curve. As the surge was coming from the right rear headed forward towards the left front, I believe this aided in a whip effect as the truck headed around the right hand curve. I believe this effect was also amplified by the efficency of the ABS brakes in conjunction with the air ride suspension, which causes the trailer to ""sit down"" or squat, and then when the brakes are released, you get an upward spring like motion. So as the truck rounded the entrance of the right hand curve, the forward left liquid surge, the upward spring motion of the brakes releasing the stored energy in the suspension and combined with the whip of the truck rounding the right hand curve, caused the trailer to roll to the left, at the exact moment that a car was passing the truck in the opposite direction. The trailer rolled on top of and then across the car, killing the occupant instantly. The trailer, now sliding on it's upper left side and vapor rails, continued to swing and slide to the left until it struck the dirt hillside and then rebounded back onto the roadway and behind the truck, which was still decelerating but never left it's lane. During the rollover, the safety/keeper bolt, which holds the pintle eye retainer nut in place, broke loose and fell onto the roadway as the trailer rolled over it.  The keeper bolt punctured and remained lodged in the shell of the tank, which was the spill sources. There were three other spill sources 1-2 inches long by 1/4-1/2 inches wide as a result of the shell impacting and sliding along the asphalt. The impact also dislodged all of the internal bulkheads, which essencially turned the three compartment trailer into a one compartment, and since there was still a slight downhill grade, the product drained from the back to the front and out of the four spill sources in the shell. Once the driver was able to stop the truck and set the brakes, and before being pulled away by bystandards, he thought to pull the emergency shutoff for the air supply to the truck's product delivery system. The driver did the same for the trailer but as this was not one of the sources, it did not aid in any containment.

Safety Kleen sub contracted the job to Clean Ventures Environmental who sub contracted the trucking of the hydrogen peroxide to Freehold Cartage (FCI). Clean Ventures arrived Monday, August 22, 2011 at 7:00am with 4 people to begin the process of emptying the hydrogen peroxide tanks. Freehold Cartage also arrived on site at 7:00 am. When the Clean Venture employee opened the manway on top of the outside hydrogen peroxide tank, the liquid appeared stable inside and no fumes or vapors were present that escaped out of the tank. The tanker had 12-15 inches of vacuum before the valve leading to the hose in the tank was opened. The hose was supplied by FCI and was placed through the top manway of the outside tank and held in place by a Clean Venture employee. Immediately the pressure in the tanker went from vacuum to approximately 35 psi and there was white colored gas escaping from all 3 manways and around the pump. The liquid in the hose blew back into the outside tank and created so much pressure the Clean Venture employee had a hard time restraining the hose. The operation was stopped while the FCI driver called his dispatcher. The FCI driver told the Clean Venture supervisor the products should be compatible and was told to attempt the operation again. Approximately 8:30am, they pulled vacuum on the tanker and opened the valve to the hose and the reaction was the same. The tanker went immediately to a pressure state, there was visible white gas escaping from the tanker and the hose back to the tank pressured up. The Clean Venture supervisor stopped the job and instructed the FCI driver to wash out the tanker. The FCI driver left site at 8:57 am to go to Pedricktown Tank Wash but left the hoses that had been in use on site.   The FCI tanker returned to site at 10:51am. When the Clean Venture employee returned to the manway on top of the outside hydrogen peroxide tank, the liquid once again appeared stable inside and no fumes or vapors were present that escaped out of the tank. They resumed operations at 11:09am using the same hoses that were used earlier in the day. They were finished pumping out the hydrogen peroxide within 30 minutes and had no issues with gas escaping from the tanker or the tanker pressuring up. The outside tank was triple rinsed using a pressure washer supplied by Clean Venture that had been filled from the city water tap at the Glassboro plant earlier that morning. The pH of the rinse water was checked and the water was also loaded into the tanker.    Approximately 12:30pm, they moved inside to empty the smaller tank. Again the top manway was removed and the product appeared stable inside the tank with no visible vapors or fumes escaping. They emptied this tank and did a triple rinse in the same manner as the outside tank with no issues. They stopped for lunch at 1:15 pm and discussed the afternoon activities because the outside scrubber","Before commencing an operation like this, the inside of the tanker, wash tickets and previous loads hauled for the tanker and hoses need to be verified by a competent individual.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,25118,ADM Cocoa,US,
