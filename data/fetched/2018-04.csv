The spill reached a nearby creek and also caused the evacuation of a nearby school due to the fumes. Because Eco does not transport red dyed diesel, the team did not believe Eco was involved. Still, the Eco Energy transportation management team reach out to drivers in the area to see if they knew anything about the spill. All drivers denied knowledge of the diesel spill. The Murphy team later contacted Eco-Energy’s transportation management team to inform them of video footage in which a driver in what looks like an Eco truck pulls a hose to the other side of his truck right where the spill was located. Using our Peoplenet system, which shows which drivers are logged into which truck and where they are located at a given time, it was determined the driver was Jaron Coleman who was not scheduled to be at that location at that time.  The Director of Transportation called Mr. Coleman to ask about the incident. Mr. Coleman told the Transportation Director he needed to ‘check his notes’ and hung up. Within the hour, Mr. Coleman called back and told him he had accidentally loaded a full compartment of red dyed diesel. When he realized his mistake, he panicked and decided to get rid of the product. He drove to Thomasville and dumped approximately 3000 gallons in the grass. Eco’s transportation management team informed Murphy of what they learned and began to collect all the necessary contacts from Murphy to include the local authorities, federal and state EPA, and the remediation consultant. Mr. Coleman was arrested by the Thomasville Sheriff Department on April 27, 2018. The duration of the release was therefore from 4/16/18 through 4/19/18 when it was discovered and response measures ensued. For a detailed description of mitigation efforts, please see the attachments.",This release was not due to equipment malfunction or insufficient operating procedures.

According to the caller, the driver of tractor (500102) 306/406 tanker (22102) was offloading product into a underground storage tank, when it over-filled. Approximately 50-gallons of diesel fuel has been released to the concrete and possibly a drain. Contractor indicated that the area impacted is 100' x 5' of concrete. Contractor estimates approximately 20-gallons of diesel released. Contractor completed work and departed site. A total estimated amount released was approximately 20-25 Gallons of diesel fuel that impacted the concrete / asphalt, storm drain, and a small area of soil. The asphalt / concrete was impacted by a 60'x3' area of diesel fuel. Diesel impacted the soil in a 5'x5'. The drain had been minimally impacted (estimated less than 1/2 of a gallon released). This spill apparently happened earlier in the day and by the time the contractor arrived and inspected the drain there was a small amount of granular absorbents laying in the drain but no sheen on the free standing water. The outflow area was inspected and it led to an outflow pipe approximately 30' away that flowed to a ditch. The ditch was inspected and no impact was discovered. HEPACO flushed the drain and placed a drum at the end to capture the impacted water (Please see in the photos). The NRC had already been contacted by Dodges Gas Station Earlier and report #1208827 had been generated (ERTS was instructed to contact EPA Region 4 800-241-1754 during daytime hours to obtain a copy of the report).   The soil was hand remediated and the asphalt was impacted with granular absorbents.

However, nothing conclusive could be determined.   Damage appears to have been caused when the package suffered an impact to its side. The box and the leaking bottle both had been dented inward. The impact caused the seal to be broken. The cap was still on the bottle, slowing the loss of the liquid. Given the relatively large amount spilled in comparison to the size in the gap of the seal,it is my belief that the damage was cause before the package arrived to this station.

He returned the package to station at end of day requesting inspection because he could smell strong fumes coming from package. There were no visible signs of leaking from the package. Package was clearly marked as a hazardous material package. QA inspected the package and confirmed one of the cans of paint within package was leaking. Package contains 2-1 gallon metal cans of Wasser MC-MIOZINC 100 Standard Green paint. Outer boxing had the capacity of holding 4 - 1 gallon cans but only 2 cans were packed within this box. Each can of paint was enclosed within an individual plastic bag and zip-tied closed. This bagging contained the leakage almost completely. A very small amount of the leakage came through the bag got on the inner boxing, however, there was no leakage contaminant on the other bagged gallon of paint within the box. There was paper packing within the boxing to protect & stabilize items throughout the shipping process.

He was unable to do so, he ran out of roadway and possible hit curb before he veered to the left and struck our vehicles tanker trailer in the center at the loading/unloading lines. The collision caused the external valve heads on the belly lines to be sheared off. This resulted in the lines from Compartment 1 and 2 (which were loaded) to release the product (gasoline) onto the roadway where it immediately ignited. (The other compartments were empty and the belly lines were dry) Our vehicle came to a stop in the roadway, the fire continued to burn and it appeared to have set the drive tires on the tractor on fire. The heat from the fire may have caused gasoline vapors to escape the trailer and also catch fire. Eventually Compartment #1 caught fire and burned thru the shell at top. Compartment #2 did not burn and product in it was not lost. Only product in Compartment #1 was lost due to the fire. The product in that compartment did not spill onto the ground, it just burned while being contained in the trailer.

THE DRIVER MADE SURE THE TRAILER WAS AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM ANY STRUCTURES AND ROADWAY AND UNHOOKED THE TRAILER FROM THE TRUCK/TRACTOR, TO GIVE EMERGENCY PERSONNEL ENOUGH ROOM TO ACCESS THE TRAILER.  AETNA HOOK HOSE & LADDER AND THE DNREC ARRIVED AT THE SCENE. A BERM WAS PUT AROUND A STORM DRAIN TO PREVENT SULFURIC ACID AND LEAD FOR ENTERING THE DRAIN. THE FIRE WAS PUT OUT AND THE NON-DAMAGED BATTERIES WERE REMOVED. THE DNREC CALLED FOR A CLEAN-UP COMPANY, GUARDIAN ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES TO HELP WITH THE CLEAN-UP.

When looking in our record keeping system I accidentally looked at the date I closed the file versus the date of incident and wrote that down as my due date.    • The fill line comes through a wall and is angled at a 45 degree angle.  Driver has to fight/drag with the hose to get it hooked up.   o Note when he removed their cap from their fill line initially there was some product there.  Roughly enough to fil up the inside of the cap.   • There is a type of gate valve on our side but nothing that clicks or locks into place. • One person was with him the entire time and there was another person up by the tank which is 5 stories up.  The guy with him and the guy upstairs have walkie talkies.   • At the end the driver confirmed with the guy upstairs that he is completely closed down and ready for disconnect.  He confirmed everything was shut down.   • Driver walked the hose to the customers fill line and shut the valve.  He could tell the hose was light.  They watched him walk the hose.   • He opened the bleeder valve and let all air and product come out into his bucket that would. • Driver had to work it a little bit to get it unhooked and when it gave way the hose popped off like it had a good amount of pressure and he did get product on him.   • This was a burst of product.  It did not keep running out.   • It wasn’t until he showered that it ran down inside his chemical suit as he showered the first time (5-6 minutes).  When he realized it was getting in his suit he started removing PPE and then jumped back in the shower for 20-30 minutes • Bleeder valve on our trailer seemed to operate normally and was not loose.  It shouldn’t be gummed up with product as most are just cleaners.   • There are 3 valves on the entire customer set up.  One where we hook up, then one on the other side of the wall before the fill line goes up the 5 stories (which we’re not allowed access to), and then one up by the tank 5 stories up.   We think that the valve closest to him isn’t holding or wasn’t fully closed allowing trapped pressurized product between the two valves to spray out.  The first valve on the other side of the wall, valve prior to the piping going vertically must not have been holding.   • Josh was then taken to then transported for treatment.  He was treated and released and has made a full recovery.",We submitted a formal request for the customer to inspect their valves to ensure they are holding.  We also flagged this on delivery with a driver who has been there before and that this will be completed on first shift hours as the person helping unload wasn't there at that time.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

It was traveling southbound on Rocky Hollow Rd, which is a 2 lane asphalt roadway around 6:45 AM.  The truck was at roughly 41 MPH, complying with the speed limit of 45. The truck was loaded with hazard class 5.1 ammonium nitrate in a DOT specification cargo tank, and 5.1 ammonium nitrate in 3 non-spec cargo bins.  It also contained a tank with roughly 200 gallons of fuel oil # 2 (for producing blended products).  About 10 minutes into the trip, the truck began veering off the right side of the road.  The driver claims that he was putting down a lift axle on the vehicle, which requires reaching over to engage a lever on the dashboard.  He slowed down slightly when doing this.   When he felt the truck pull to the right, the driver's response was to steer to the left in attempt to get the truck back on the roadway.  The right hand side wheels dug deep into the soil at the edge of the pavement, causing the truck to pitch violently to the right.  The truck's body made contact with the ditch and rolled, sliding a short distance down the road, and coming to rest mostly off the road on its drivers side.  The lids were ripped off the 3 ammonium nitrate bins, causing about 5,000 pounds of the granular substance to form in a pile.  Roughly 100 pounds of ammonium nitrate emulsion was expelled out of the pressure relief valve on the top of the tank.  The fuel oil tank was punctured with a  basketball-sized hole, causing roughly 150 gallons of the product fuel to leak out.  The driver extricated himself from the wrecked truck, and initiated Austin's emergency response procedure.  The driver was transported to the hospital where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries (bruises, cuts, scrapes).  The spilled product was confined to a relatively small area that can be described as grassy pasture.  The spill contractor removed the spilled product and the impacted soil, placing it in 4 roll-off containers.  From there, it was profiled, and landfilled.  The road re-opened for traffic around 11:00 AM.","The 200 gallon diesel tank failed because of a large hole being punctured in it.  We cannot recommend any improvements to the packaging.  Nor can we with the DOT specification cargo tank containing the AN emulsion.  The product that spilled, was simply ""burped"" out of the pressure relief vent at the top of the tank due to the sideways orientation of the truck.  The majority of the product that spilled was ammonium nitrate, which simply fell from the 3 bins when their covers were ripped off.  In the case of the packaging, if anything failed, it was the closure on the AN bins.  We have found in the past however, that even when they initially stay closed in an accident, we still end up losing product in that they are not designed to be sealed packages.  The driver was new to the company (not new to driving).

(RSI) driver was hauling seven (7) IBC's of specialty oilfield chemicals on a flat bed trailer from RSI's Ft. Stockton yard to a customer O&G lease site (Pecan/Woods State Unit) near Coyanosa, Pecos County, Texas. At approximately 7:25 AM CST the driver turned off of Highway 290 into the Love's truck stop located at 2723 E. US Highway 290 in Ft. Stockton, Pecos County, Texas. As the driver made the turn, one of the totes slid off the back of the trailer and struck the ground. The force of the impact crushed the metal cage and ruptured the plastic container, causing a roughly 6"" tear along the center top edge of the container (see photos). This resulted in the almost instantaneous release of the IBC's contents, roughly 300 gallons of a xylene-ethylbenzene solvent blend (RSI-3119-164-106). A Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for this product was submitted to Mr. Galata Tona of US DOT on April 27, 2018, by way of follow-up to a phone conversation between Karl Mueller, RSI's Environmental Manager and Mr. Tona earlier that day. Mr. Justin Owns of RSI and the driver (Mr. Jaime Palcios) initiated response actions and worked with truck stop staff to re-direct traffic and attempted to contain the spill using clay absorbent until Fire Department/HAZMAT teams could arrive. Units from Department of Public Safety (DPS), local police, and local fire department (Ft. Stockton VFD) responded to the incident; the driver was cited for failure to properly secure load. At 9:10 AM ET Love's contacted their national spill response contractor, Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS), who then dispatched a local sub-contractor (Accuworx) to conduct spill response/remediation operations. ERTS also made initial local, county, state, and federal notifications. Upon arrival at the scene, Accuworx technicians removed ponded free liquids from concrete and other impervious surfaces, followed by application of clay absorbent and sweeping of impacted impervious areas. Approximately 4-5 drums of impacted soil, along with another 2-3 drums of impacted sorbent and spill debris was generated as a result of response activities and transferred to a roll-off box for disposal. Final invoices and manifests for disposal have yet to be received, and a final report summarizing the response is delayed pending receipt of same.","RSI drivers have been counseled/reminded of the need to properly inspect loads and trucks/trailers as part of pre-trip inspection process, and use of a pre-trip inspection checklist has been proposed.

DATE OF INCIDENT: 4-23-18  K2 TANK LINES WAS NOT AWARE OF A POSSIBLE ACCIDENT UNTIL AT LEAST 8 HOURS AFTER OCCURRENCE. ANOTHER DRIVER CALLED DISPATCH AROUND 12:00 SAYING HE THOUGHT HE HEARD ON THE NEWS THE NAME OF A K2 DRIVER AS THE NEWS REPORT DISCUSSED THE LARGE TRUCK FIRE ON I-70. IT WAS SEVERAL HOURS LATER THAT K2 CONFIRMED THE IDENTITY OF THE EQUIPMENT AND DRIVER INVOLVED.  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE AN EYEWITNESS TO THESE EVENTS AND THE DRIVER INVOLVED CLAIMS TO NOT HAVE MEMORY OF THE SPECIFIC DETAILS. THIS IS A SUMMARY OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE.  ON 4-23-18, AT ABOUT 4:00 AM, DRIVER WAS EASTBOUND ON I-70 IN ST. PETERS, MO AND APPARENTLY LOST CONTROL STRIKING THE GUARDRAIL. THIS CAUSED HIM TO OVERTURN ON THE RAMP/ACCESS ROAD. HE WAS DRIVING A TANKER TRAILER WITH 8,501 GALLONS OF ETHANOL, AND WHEN EMERGENCY PERSONNEL ARRIVED, THEY ALLOWED IT TO BURN OUT. DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE FIRE, THE EQUIPMENT WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED AND ITS ACTUAL IDENTITY AND OWNERSHIP WAS NOT DETERMINED UNTIL THE EVENING OF 4-23-18.  THE MISSOURI STATE POLICE CALLED THE STATE OF MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES TO THE SCENE VERY QUICKLY, AND THEY ENGAGED A COMPANY (ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATIONS) TO CONTAIN ANY SPILL AND MONITOR THE SCENE. NONE OF THE ETHANOL REACHED ANY POND OR STREAM, AND REMEDIATION OF THE DIRT/GRASS AREA AROUND THE SCENE BEGAN IMMEDIATELY. K2 WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. SOME SKIMMING OF DIRT WAS REQUIRED ALONGSIDE THE ROADWAY. THE MO DNR AGREED THAT THE REMEDIATION OPERATIONS COULD CEASE BY THE NEXT DAY. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE TOTAL INVOICE FROM ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDATION WILL BE $35,000 TO $40,000.  PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE ROAD WAS INCLUDED 2 LIGHT POLES, GUARDRAILS, CONCRETE MEDIAN BARRIES AND ROAD SURFACE. THE STATE OF MISSOURI WAS REPAIRING ALL DAMAGE AND THE ACTUAL COST IS UNKNOWN. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY PICTURES OF THE INCIDENT AS THE DRIVER WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL WITH MINOR INJURIES AND WE WERE NOT AWARE OF IT UNTIL CLEAN-UP HAD BEGUN. WE WERE ABLE TO FIND SOME ST.

Philipsburg, PA.  The truck was headed for a customer in Karthaus, PA.  The road, which is known as State Hwy 53, or Kylertown Drifting Road, is a 2 lane state route that is relatively narrow, with a small berm of roughly 3'.  The speed limit is 45 where the accident occurred. The road conditions  were wet.  About 10-15 minutes into the trip, the truck was traveling around a  curve  (going to the left).  After going around the curve, the vehicle began veering off the roadway.  The driver attempted to bring the vehicle back onto the road by steering to the left causing the truck to overturn and roll.  The truck slid for roughly 70 feet where it came to rest in the roadway facing east at the edge of a farmer's field.  The truck was blocking both lanes of traffic.  The vehicle came to rest on its passenger side at a telephone poll, which was cracked and bent by the impact. With the truck on its side, ammonium nitrate began slowly leaking out of the 2 cargo bins (the lids of the bids had been torn off in the crash).  Fuel Oil #2, which was also present on the unit, leaked from its tank, which had been damaged.  In total about 1000 pounds of ammonium nitrate and 100-150 gallons of fuel oil spilled from the vehicle.   There was also a DOT specification cargo tank on the vehicle containing 920 gallons of ammonium nitrate emulsion.  This tank was not damaged in the event, and no product was released. The driver extricated himself from the vehicle under his own power, and refused medical treatment at the scene (he later was taken to the hospital for an evaluation and post-accident drug screen.  He was found to have non-life threatening injuries).  The driver was able to initiate Austin's emergency response plan, so first responders were on the scene within a few minutes. A spill contactor showed up a short time after that, and used a vacuum truck to remove the product from the roadway and field.  Two large rolloff containers were filled with the spilled product, and taken back to the Austin facility.  A crew replaced the telephone pole, and the roadway was re-opened completely around 1:00 PM.  The impacted area of the field was covered with plastic, and further remediation was done at a later date, generating 18 tons of impacted soil that was profiled and landfilled.","The driver was experienced, having operated a MBT for Austin for the last several years.  He frequently drove this section of road as there are 2 customers that require taking this portion of route 53.  The driver was interviewed the following day, and indicated that he swerved to avoid deer that he claims were in the roadway.  The driver claims to have been traveling around 35 MPH. However the telematics equipment on the vehicle did not capture second by second data prior to the event, so we are largely unable to tell.  Whether he was indeed swerving to avoid an animal or he took the curve too fast and was unable to stay on the road, the result is clearly that he left the roadway for a distance of about 200 feet, struggled to get back on it, and overturned the truck.  This particular section of State Route 53 is well known to our drivers in the area, and through our discussions with drivers and our observations at the scene, we have decided to route the drivers a different way when servicing these customers in the future.  We have a policy of not swerving to avoid animals when driving a CMV.  This policy is being reinforced with our driver group.  Lastly, this driver is on light duty work because of his injuries.  If he is retained, he will undergo extensive retraining and evaluation prior to getting back in a CMV.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,123000,AUSTIN POWDER COMPANY,US,

A review of the documentation, which detailed predominately aircraft parts, also included a proforma commercial invoice for a “Charged Sphere Fire Extinguisher.”  Since this commodity was suspected of containing Dangerous Goods (“DG”), Expeditors-ATL contacted the consignee and requested additional information.  On April 26, 2018, the consignee, confirmed that the “Charged Sphere Fire Extinguisher” contained DG.   At this time, Expeditors-ATL informed the consignee that the DG commodity would require re-packaging, labeling and preparation of a Shipper’s Dangerous Goods declaration.    On May 08, 2018, Expeditors-ATL was informed by the consignee, that Propack International would create the dangerous goods declaration and repackage the DG item to bring it into compliance with the DG regulations. Expeditors-ATL communicated this information to St. George warehouse, the location where the cargo was being stored.    On May 11, 2018, Propack International was dispatched to St. George warehouse where they recovered the DG item and returned it to their warehouse facility to perform repackaging and documentation services.      On May 15, 2018, once the shipment was properly packaged and documented, the shipment was delivered back to Expeditors-ATL for subsequent delivery to the consignee.","Expeditors-ATL contacted freight forward Log'Xpress and informed them of the undeclared dangerous good issue.

HE HAD STOPPED AT THE 4 WAY INTERSECTION OF ROUTE 313 AND ROUTE 392 AT THE 4 WAY BLINKING TRAFFIC LIGHT. HE PROCEEDED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE INTERSECTION HEADING SOUTH ON ROUTE 313. THE DRIVER GLANCED AT THE DRIVER'S SIDE MIRROR. WHEN HE LOOKED FORWARD HIS PASSENGER SIDE WHEELS WERE ALREADY ON THE NARROW SHOULDER. THE ROAD WAS WET, WITH TALL GRASS ON THE SIDE AND A STEEP EDGE AND A DITCH ALONG SIDE. THERE WAS NO WAY OF CORRECTING THE TRUCK BACK ONTO THE ROAD. THE TRUCK WAS LEANING TOWARD THE PASSENGER SIDE AND CONTINUED STRAIGHT AHEAD AT WHICH POINT A UTILITY POLE LOCATED 10-12 FEET BACK FROM THE ROAD DESTROYED THE BOX OF THE TRUCK AS IT PASSED BY. ALL OF THE FREIGHT EMPTIED OUT OF THE TRUCK INTO THE DITCH AND CORN FIELD.   THE MARYLAND STATE POLICE ARRIVED AT THE SCENE. THE DRIVER WAS TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR CHECK UP. THE LOCAL FIRE COMPANY WAS DISPATCHED AND SHORTLY ARRIVED AT THE SCENE TO CONTAIN THE INCIDENT. A HAZ MAT TEAM WAS ALSO DISPATCHED DUE IT BEING A LOAD OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL-LEAD ACID BATTERIES. THE GROUND AREA AND DITCH WERE BOTH DAMMED UP WITH PADS AND SOCKS AND ACID ABSORBENT WAS PUT DOWN. THE PH WAS MONITORED IN THE AREA AND WAS TESTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS NEUTRAL. THE BATTERIES WERE PICKED UP AND PUT INTO TOTES TO CONTAIN ANY LEAKAGE. THE LOOSE SOIL WAS CLEANED UP AND LOADED INTO A ROLL OFF ALONG WITH THE ROOF OF THE TRUCK THAT WAS BADLY DAMAGED AND DAMAGED PALLETS AND BOXES. THE PH WAS CHECKED AGAIN BEFORE PICKING UP THE PADS AND SOCKS AND PUT INTO DISPOSAL BAGS ALONG WITH THE SPLASH SUITES THAT WERE ALSO PUT INTO THE ROLL OFF. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WASHED OFF THE ROAD AND THE GROUND AREA WAS FLUSHED. NO DIESEL WAS SPILLED. THE DIESEL THAT WAS LEFT INT HE TRUCK WAS PUMPED OUT AND COLLECTED TO HELP STABILIZE THE TRUCK TO AID IN PULLING IT OUT OF THE DITCH AND UP-RIGHTING IT. THE ENTIRE AREA WAS FILLED, LEVELED, RE-SEEDED AND CURLEX WAS PUT DOWN FOR STABILIZATION. THE POWER COMPANY CAME LATER TO INSPECT THE POLE. ALL WAS CLEARED BY 12:00 AM SEPTEMBER 25.  THE ROLL OFF IS BEING STORED AT AAA RECOVERY & SITE RESTORATION, LLC UNTIL IT IS FILLED. IT WILL THEN GO TO A LOCAL REGULAR LANDFILL IN DORCHESTER, MD FOR DISPOSAL. THE COLLECTED DIESEL FUEL IS ALSO BEING KEPT ONSITE AT AAA RECOVERY WHERE THEY ARE PERMITTED TO RE-USE IT IN THEIR OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT. A DRUM OF DEF WAS ALSO PUMPED OUT OF THE TRUCK. THIS IS ALSO BEING HELD AT AAA RECOVERY FOR DETERMINATION BY THE STATE REGARDING THE DISPOSAL/RECOVERY OR RECYCLING OF THE DEF.

The car was isolated and the National Response Center, West Virginia Public Utilities Commission, and shipper were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report # 2018-0411-00304). Specialized Professional Services, Inc., a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the vapor line valve partially open and the secondary closure plug less than tool tight. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Mr. Tom Moppold, Sr. of Global Chemical Resources. Contractor personnel secured the valve and secondary closure.

He called the Brewster Yardmaster to report the leak.  I, John Vergis Environmental Officer for the WLE, was then called by the WLE Chief Dispatcher to come out and look at the car.  When I arrived, I was able to hear vapor being released from the top of the car.  I removed seal number 36456 from the protective housing lid and then found that the vapor valve was leaking through the valve plug.  I tried to tighten the valve handle and when I did, the leak stopped.  I then tightened the loose valve plug.  I checked the liquid valves to see if the plugs were tight and they were not.  I tightened them.  I then installed seal number 971781 back on the protective housing and then released the car for service.  Also, on the car waybill and long train list, there was no proper basic description for the car.

Taylor, a CSXT hazardous materials manager, was dispatched to the scene and found 2 of 4 liquid line to fittings plate flange securement bolts less than tool tight, resulting in a release. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Mr. Jeff Angle of Phillips 66. The securement bolts were properly secured and the release terminated.
