Responder entered the trailer and retrieved the label from the leaking container. The container was leaking from a drum failure on its side believed to be created by corrosion.      EH&S reviewed the WIP for chemical constituents. RQ of the material was confirmed to be 100lbs. On review of the WIP it was decided to upgrade to Tychem 4000 with supplied air for working with the leaking container.

The car was isolated and the shipper Reagent Chemical & Research, Inc., the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (report number 2017-5136), and the NRC (report number 1183583) were notified.  CHEMTREC report number  2017-07-09-00045.  SWS, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the car leaking from the loading / unloading liquid closure flange.  The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper (Kevin Callais, phone number 281-404-9728).  Contractor personnel replaced the broken nut / bolt assemblies.  The shipper hired SPSI to replace the liquid education line and put new top fitting closure flanges, bolts, and gaskets, and bubble leak tested the car.  During further inspection by the shipper, the gasket on the closure flange was missing.  The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

Driver pulled off highway to safe location to investigate. The stainless steel flex pipe supplying the inlet side of the LCO2 load out pump had catastrophically failed causing the pump to twist out of position toward front of trailer. It damaged the bottom of trailer skin and pump frame. No injuries and no third party damage.,"The flex hose failure was the result of an overpressure of the line due to liquid CO2 not properly being cleared. A main contributing factor was the lack of relief protection in the section of piping between 2 block valves.  Active coaching and discussions about this incident will be and are taking place during mandatory safety meetings. All fleet trailers have been inspected to review proper thermal relief valve placement.

The area was immediately cordoned off and efforts began to contain and clean-up the released material.     Upon further inspection, it was discovered that the IBC was ruptured at the bottom of the container which resulted in most of the contents being released during the event.    Liquids remaining within the breached container were transferred to an appropriate DOT container for shipment to the ultimate disposal site. The empty breached container was cut up for disposal and containerized along with the debris generated during the clean-up. Containers of other waste materials on the trailer were not damaged during the release and were transferred to a clean trailer. The trailer was secured and removed from the Veolia 10-Day Yard to the MP Environmental Yard for decontamination. A bob cat style excavator was used to remove from 1 inch to 3 inches of soil in the area under and behind the trailer. Potentially contaminated soil was collected in a roll off bin and is currently in temporary storage at the Veolia 10-Day Yard. The release was localized to the area directly under and behind the trailer. The material did not penetrate the soil greater than 2 -3 inches and was clearly discernable by the staining of the soil and gravel. Based on analytical results received, additional excavation to a depth of 1 foot of the spill area is planned to begin on July 25, 2017.","Additional training with employees responsible for the packaging of IBC containers, containing hydrogen peroxide solutions >40 but less 60 percent to assure the container has a vented bung.

The distortion and bulging of the drum lid was significant enough to allow some reacting waste to seep through the lid and drum ring. The nature of the waste was such that it became a hard foam like substance when its reaction was complete, thus the released waste never got to the ground. Upon discovery, an emergency field services crew was called in and donned the correct personal protective equipment. The crew was able to assess the situation fully, call the generator for detailed instructions on how to stop the monomer reaction, obtain 4-methoxyphenol additive, and fully stabilize the reacting drum. As a precaution, the crew stabilized all the remaining three drums in this shipment.  After this was completed, the damaged drum was placed in salvage drum for continued transportation to the final disposal facility.     There was no additional waste created, as there was no need for cleanup or remediation. The minimal amount of the release did not meet the required threshold for reporting in the state of Pennsylvania.","The generator was made aware of the incident at the time it occurred, and was instrumental in get the situation corrected.

No soil, water ways or storm drains were impacted. Facility personnel immediately notified all internal parties and initiated the in-house clean up procedure, utilizing our emergency response team. The facility personnel, wearing the appropriate PPE, mitigated the leak with absorbent material and a bucket. The ER team arrived onsite, donned proper PPE, began the site assessment and entered the trailer. They were able to locate the leaking drum, over-pack the drum, and decontaminate the trailer and site safely. The ER team concluded that the drum had a pin hole near the bottom, thus causing the release. It was also discovered that the UN specification on the drum was too deteriorated/corroded to be read. The waste generated from the clean-up was placed in the over-pack drum, it was properly marked and labeled and sent to the final destination disposal facility without further incident.","The driver who introduced this drum into transportation was given corrective training in drum closure and inspection, as well as package labeling and marking.

Upon arrival, the driver staged his tractor trailer at the 10-day containment pad and immediately noticed an active drip coming from his trailer. The driver notified the Operations Manager and an internal emergency response team was dispatched. The local operation team, donned proper PPE, contained the release with absorbent on the concrete and placed a poly bucket under the active leak. They also re-tracked the trucks path on the property and found no signs of a release on the soil. The ER team arrived on site, donned proper PPE, assessed the site and trailer. It was determined that no soil, water ways or storm/sewer drains were impacted by this release. The ER team entered the trailer and identified the leaking drum, inspected the container and found it was cracked on the bottom of the drum. The ER team thoroughly and safely decontaminated the trailer and site. The waste generated from the response and the damaged drum were safely placed into a UN rated salvage drum, labeled, marked and sent to its final disposal destination without further incident.","An investigation into this release led to clear communication with the generator regarding container selection and inspection when preparing waste for transportation. Communication with the third party transporter regarding similar values, as well as reporting requirements also ensued.

While moving it with a fork lift, facility personnel noticed a small leak from the bottom seam of a 55 gallon drum. The minor release was onto secondary concrete containment, no soil or water was impacted.     A response crew was notified, donned the appropriate personal protective equipment, and over packed the leaking drum into a properly rated salvage drum for continued transportation to the final disposal facility. The facility floor was also cleaned, and the waste generated by cleanup placed into the appropriate waste stream for disposal.      This release was reported to the CT DEEP 17:18 EST 07/27/2017, #2017-03787  operator# 203.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking was observed. There were no apparent signs of rough mishandling of the drum, or of any deterioration. This leads us to conclude the this bottom seam release was likely the result of a manufacturing defect.

(RSI). The site is leased from a local property owner and has been in operation since 2014. The site consists of two (2) 9,041 gallon-capacity fiberglass reinforced plastic storage tanks, along with an approximately 450 gallon field tank which is used as a water scrubber to control emissions of HCl vapors during loading/unloading operations. All of the tanks sit within a bermed and lined containment area made of native caliche-type soils and gravel. Past practice at this facility has been for the chemical vendor (Reagent Chemical) to perform chemical deliveries without RSI personnel present on-site. On the date of the incident, a new delivery driver for Reagent who was unfamiliar with the site arrived to offload a 5,000 gallon shipment of 32% HCl. He was operating Tractor# 635980 and Trailer #634 when the incident occurred. The BOL did not indicate which of the two tanks was to be filled. The driver attempted to verify which of the two tanks was empty using level gauges but experienced some difficulty; he had been instructed to check sight glasses and unload into the tank with the lowest level, but the valve to one of the sight glasses was closed. After eventually confirming which tank had sufficient freeboard, he connected the transfer hoses and began transferring acid from the tanker to what he believed to be the empty (or nearly empty) tank. After approximately 20 minutes, the driver observed acid overflowing from the scrubber tank and in an effort to keep additional acid from spilling into the containment area, he closed one of two in-line valves on the vent lines from the acid tank to the scrubber instead of shutting off flow at the tank. Shortly after closing the vent valve, the operator heard a muffled explosion and the bottom of the tank being filled ruptured at the lower head, releasing acid into the containment area. While the majority of acid was confined within the containment, an unknown portion (50-100 gallons) escaped containment and impacted an approximately 10 square yard area on an adjacent property owned by the lease owner.  Following the tank rupture and release, the driver shut down the transfer pumps and contacted dispatch, who then contacted RSI. RSI dispatched several personnel from the Cuero and Pleasanton yards to the site for initial assistance, as well as a spill response contractor (Mr. Eddie Lero with Cleaning Solutions of Bryan, TX). In addition, RSI personnel began searching for a lined vacuum truck capable of removing acid from the containment. Once on-scene, RSI personnel applied soda ash to the material outside of containment to limit life and property damage. By 11:00 the release of product from both the delivery trailer and the tank had ceased. Product recovery operations using an acid-rated vacuum truck began at approximately 13:00 but were terminated a","As a result of this incident, Reagent Chemical and RSI have proposed the following corrective/preventative actions:    1. The practice of unsupervised bulk HCl deliveries will no longer be permitted. RSI will provide an attendant familiar with the site to supervise bulk acid deliveries.    2. Additional signage will be placed at site (on tanks, valves, etc.) clarifying tank and valve nomenclature and providing simplified off-loading instructions, as well as an RSI contact number for assistance.    3. Special instructions will be added to the Bill of Lading (BOL) that require driver/dispatch to contact RSI in the event of a question concerning tank selection or for any other question related to material transfer at the Cotulla facility.    4. The practice of placing additional valves in vent line will be reviewed to see if vent lines can be re-designed without them.    5. A design evaluation of the current scrubber system will be made to confirm that vent pipe sizing and head pressure of water scrubber does not exceed MAWP for tank. Delivery drivers will instructed to off-load at a controlled, slow rate to reduce the likelihood of an overpressure.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,123500,"REFINERY SPECIALTIES, INCORPORATED",US,

In proper personal protective equipment, the facility personnel safely moved the pallet and sack into containment. ER team arrived on site, donned the proper PPE and assessed the site and trailer. It was determined that the pallet on to which the IBC  was loaded, had broken and pierced the container. Only the pallet and trailer were impacted by the release; no soil, water, or storm drains were impacted. The ER team thoroughly decontaminated the trailer. The waste generated from the clean-up, along with the waste from the super sack were repackaged into the appropriate UN spec 55-gallon drums, labeled and marked appropriately and sent to their final disposal destination without further incident.
