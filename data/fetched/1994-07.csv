(""CHESI"") WAS DISPATCHED TO MARTIN MARIETTA, INCORPORATED (""MMI"") LOCATED AT 10 LAKESIDE AVENUE IN BURLINGTON, VT TO PICK-UP A LOAD OF WASTE CORROSIVE LIQUID, N.O.S. (CHROMIC AND SOLUTION). UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SITE, THE CHESI DRIVER WAS DIRECTED MMI EMPLOYEE TO THE FIRST STORAGE TANK THAT WAS TO BE PUMPED OUT. THE MMI EMPLOYEE CONNECTED THE TRANSFER HOSE TO THE TANKS TO BE PUMPED OUT WHILE THE CHESI DRIVER ATTACHED THE HOSE TO THE VEHICLE. UPON COMPLETION OF THIS TASK, THE TRANSFER OPERATION WAS INITIATED (PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION WAS BEING PUMPED INTO THE REAR COMPARTMENT OF A SPLIT COMPARTMENT CARGO DISCOVERED THAT PALE YELLOW VAPORS WERE COMING FROM THE VENT STACK OF THE SCRUBBER SYSTEM ON THE CARGO TANK. THE TRANSFER WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN AND THE VAPORS SUBSIDED. MMI THEN HOOKED UP TO A SECOND TANK THAT CONTAINED IDENTICAL MATERIAL AND RESUMED THE PUMPING OPERATION BUT WAS FORCED TO STOP THE TRANSFER AS VAPORS AGAIN BEGAN ESCAPING FROM THE VENT STACK. AT THIS POINT, THE CHESI DRIVER REFUSED TO ACCEPT ADDITIONAL MATERIAL FROM THIS TANK. THE DRIVER WAS THEN DIRECTED TO PUMP A THIRD TANK INTO THE FRONT COMPARTMENT AND PRIOR TO CONDUCTING THIS TRANSFER, MMI EMPLOYEES FLUSHED THE TRANSFER HOSES WITH WATER AND ADDED THIS RINSE WATER TO THE REAR COMPARTMENT. THE TRANSFER OF THE THIRD TANK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE DRIVER THEN PREPARED THE VEHICLE AND ALL ANCILLARY EQUIPMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION AND PROCEEDED TO THE GUARD SHACK AT MMI TO OBTAIN ALL REQUIRED PAPERWORK AND SIGNATURES. PRIOR TO DEPARTURE, THE DRIVER CONDUCTED ONE LAST CHECK OF THE LOAD AND DISCOVERED THAT THE REAR COMPARTMENT OF THE CARGO TANK WAS HOT TO THE TOUCH. HE IMMEDIATELY INFORMED MMI THAT THE LOAD WAS NOT SAFE TO TRANSFER AND RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE CONTAINMENT PAD IN THE EVENT OF A CONTAINER FAILURE. THE CHESI DRIVER THEN CONTACTED HIS HOME OFFICE TO APPRAISE THEM OF THE SITUATION WHO IN-TURN CONTACTED MMI TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CAUSES OF THE REACTION. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE MATERIAL PUMPED INTO THE CARGO TANK WAS NOT A CHROMIC ACID SOLUTION AS INDICATED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE STORAGE TANKS BUT RATHER A MIXTURE OF NITRIC, SULFURIC, HYDROCHLORIC AND PHOSPHORIC ACIDS. THIS MIXTURE IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH A STAINLESS STEEL TANK AND BECAUSE OF THIS, CHESI REQUESTED THAT STEPS BE TAKEN TO OFF-LOAD THE VEHICLE TO PREVENT BOTH A MAJOR RELEASE AND FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE CARGO TANK. THE REACTION INSIDE THE TANK CONTINUED AND VAPORS WERE BEING GIVEN OFF THROUGH THE VENT SYSTEM OF THE CARGO TANK. IN RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT, MMI HIRED AN OUTSIDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR TO RESPOND TO THE INCIDENT AS CHESI WAS NEVER IN CONTROL OF THE LOAD NOR THE LOADING PROCEDURES. WHILE PREPARING A RESPONSE PLAN, A WATER SPRAY WAS USED BY MMI'S CONTRACTOR TO CONTROL THE INCREASED TEMPERATURE OF THE TANK CAUSED BY THE REACTION BETWEEN THE LADING, THE LINING OF THE TANK AND THE WATER THAT MMI ADDED TO THE LOAD.

AFTER BACKING THE TRUCK INTO POSITION, I BOLTED MY DISCHARGE HOSE OPENING TO THE TANK INLET VALVE.  AFTER CHECKING FOR LEAKS, WHICH THERE WERE NONE, AND SEEING THAT THE FLOW OF LIQUID WAS FLOWING INTO THE TANK WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS, THE OPERATOR TOLD ME HE HAD TO GO BACK TO THE CONTROL ROOM TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE CONTROL PANEL WHICH I TOLD HIM WAS OK.  AFTER APPROXIMATELY 5 T 7 MINUTES LATER, I WAS LEANING AGANST THE REAR FENDER OF THE TRAILER WITH MY BACK TO THE DISCHARGE VALVE WHEN I HEARD A LOUD NOISE IMMEDIATELY I TURNED AROUND AND SAW THAT THE DISCHARGE HOSE HAD COME APART FROM THE FLANGE.  I IMMEDIATELY RAN UP THE STAIRS OF THE TRAILER AND TURNED THE DISCHARGE VALVE OFF, ALSO TURNED THE AIR SUPPLY OFF AND WENT INTO THE OPERATORS ROOM, TO INFORM HIM OF WHAT JUST OCCURRED.  HE CALLED A COUPLE OF HIS COWORKERS AND WHEN WE GOT BACK TO THE AREA WE PUT ON OUR SAFETY GEAR AND RESPIRATORS, WE THEN PROCEEDED ON NEUTRALIZING THE ACID, (HCL) WITH SODIUM BICARBONATE WHICH IS AN ACID NEUTRALIZER.  AT THIS TIME, THE PLANT MANAGER WAS INFORMED, JEFF WHITE.  AFTER GOING OVER THE SITUATION WE NOTIFIED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  WHEN THEY ARRIVED, THEY SURVEYED THE SITUATION AND AFTER DETERMINING THE SPILL HAD BEEN CONTAINED TO A SMALL AREA, AND MOST OF THE ACID HAD BEEN NEUTALIZED, FIREOFFICER RON KEUSER STATED THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ELSE, AND THE SITUATION WAS UNDER CONTROL.  THEY LEFT.  AT THAT TIME JEFF WHITE CONTACTED MSE ENVIRONJMENTAL A CLEAN UP COMPANY.  THE SENT OVER A REPRESENTATIVE AND AFTER 30 TO 40 MINUTES TIM DEVIDES ARRIVED.

AFTER SPEAKING WITH JEFF WHITE, THE PLANT MANAGER, HE INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD SPOKEN WITH REYNALDO GARCIA FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY AT (215) 245-3589 AND THAT MR GARCIA HAD AUTHORIZED THE CLEAN UP.  ALSO A COMPAINES REPRESENTATIVE WAS COMING OVER FROM SANTA BARBARA TO SURVEY THE DAMAGES.

DURING THE TRIP, THE DRIVER STOPPED AT A WEIGH STATION LOCATED ON ROUTE 83 SOUTH IN FREELAND,MD WHERE HE WAS INSPECTED BY THE MARYLAND STATE POLICE AND MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. DURING THIS INSPECTION , THE INSPECTORS NOTED THAT 2 OF THE 55 GALLON CONTAINERS WERE LEAKING FROM THE BUNG CAPS LOCATED ON THE TOP OF THE CONTAINERS AND THAT SEVERAL OF THE DRUMS HAD DISTENDED HEADS CAUSED BY THE HIGH AMBIENT AIR TEMPERATURE. PLEASE NOT THE CONTAINERS AND WAS PREVENTED FROM ESCAPING TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE DECISION WAS MADE TO LOOSEN THE BUNGS ON THE DRUMS TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE AND TO DISPATCH A CLEAN HARBOR'S FIELD SERVICE CREW TO PLACE THE CONTAINERS INTO SUITABLE SALVAGE DRUMS. UPON ARRIVAL, THE FIELD SERVICE CREW PLACED THE CONTAINERS IN QUESTION INTO SUITABLE SALVAGE DRUMS. UPON COMPLETION OF THIS OPERATION, THE CONTAINERS WERE SENT TO THE WAST MANAGEMENT FACILITY LISTED ON THE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANIFEST THAT ACCOMPAINED THE SHIPMENT. PRIOR TO DEPARTURE FROM THE SHIPPER'S LOCATION, ALL CONTAINERS WERE INSPECTED AND THE DRIVER NOTICED THAT THE BUNG CAPS ON SEVERAL OF THE DRUMS WERE LEAKING.

AT THE DRIVER'S NEXT STOP, HE INSPECTED THE CONTAINERS AND FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF LEAKING OR DAMAGE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WAS THE HIGH AMBIENT AIR TEMPERATURE COUPLED WITH NOT PROVIDING ENOUGH HEAD SPACE IN THE CONTAINERS TO ALLOW FOR MATERIAL EXPANSION. IN ORDER TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE, THE SHIPPER WILL BE NOTIFIED AS TO THE SUSPECTED CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT AND WILL BE REQUESTED TO LEAVEE SUFFICIENT HEAD SPACE ON FUTURE SHIPMENTS.

THE BOTTOM LIP ON 1 DRUM RUBBED THROUGH THE SIDE ON ANOTHER.  RIDEL ENVIRONMENTAL WAS CALLED TO OVERPACK THE DRUM. RELOADED OVERPACK-DELIVERED TO CONSIGNEE.  AT 1500 HOURS, TWO RIEDEL PERSONNEL ENTERED THE TRAILER WITH AIR MONITORING EQUIPMENT AND FLASHLIGHTS TO LOCATE THE AFFECTED DRUM(S).  MR. WILSON REMAINED AT THE REAR OF THE TRAILER AS SAFETY WATCH.  THE REMAINING ON-SCENE PERSONNEL STAYED AT THEIR VEHICLES APPROXIMATELY 50 YARDS TO THE SOUTH OF THE TRAILER.  CONTINUOUS AIR MONITORING INDICATED ADEQUATE OXYGEN LEVELS WITHIN THE TRAILER AND NO EXPLOSIVE POTENTIALS.  THE TRAILER WAS LOADED WITH NINETY-SIX 55 GALLON STEEL DRUMS OF SHERWIN-WILLIAMS LACQUER THINNER. THE SPILL WAS LOCATED AT THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER AND INVOLVED ONE 55 GALLON DRUM OF LACQUER THINNER.  THE RIEDEL CREW EXITED THE TRAILER AND BEGAN PREPARATION FOR OFFLOADING DRUMS TO REACH THE LEAKING DRUM.  THE RIEDEL STAKEBED TRUCK, WITH THE LIFTGATE DEPLOYED, WAS BACKED UP TO MEET THE FLOOR LEVEL OF THE SCHNEIDER TRAILER.  TWO DRUM HAND CARTS WERE USED BY THE RIEDEL CREW TO BEGIN REMOVAL OF THE LACQUER THINNER DRUMS.  A SERIES OF THREE DRUMS, IN TURN, WERE REMOVED FROM THE REAR OF THE TRAILER TO CREATE A PATHWAY TO THE AFFECTED DRUM.  THESE DRUMS WERE PLACED ON THE LIFTGATE, LOWERED TO THE GROUND, AND STAGED APPROXIMATELY TEN FEET TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STAKEBED TRUCK.  A TOTAL OF NINETEEN DRUMS WERE OFFLOADED BEFORE REMEDIATION WORK COMMENCED.    THE LEAKING DRUM WAS RELOCATED TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER AFTER IT WAS INSPECTED IN PLACED.  A SMALL DENT JUST ABOVE THE BOTTOM SEAM IN THE DRUM WAS OBSERVED WITH THE LACQUER THINNER EXITING AS A SLOW DRIP.  TECHNICIAN COOK TOOK PICTURES OF THE DRUM.  THE RIEDEL CREW THEN USED THE BOOM CRANE ON THE STAKEBED TO LOAD THE DAMAGED DRUM INTO AN 85 GALLON STEEL OVERPACK FOR TRANSPORT.  ALL FREE LIQUID LACQUER THINNER ON THE TRAILER FLOOR WAS REMEDIATED USING ABSORBANT PADS AND PLACED INSIDE THE OVERPACK BEFORE BEING RESEALED.  A FLAMMABLE LIQUID STICKER WAS PLACED ON THE OVERPACK FOR IDENTIFICATION. TECHINCIAN COOK TOOK A PICTURE OF THE OVERPACK AND REQUESTED FOR CLOSURE OF THE SITE RESPONSE, BUSINESS CARDS EXCHANGED, AND TECHNICIAN COOK AND MR. GUY LEFT SITE TO RESUME OFFICIAL DUTIES.  RIEDEL PERSONNEL RELOADED THE LACQUER THINNER DRUMS FROM THE GROUND USING A BARREL GRABBER AND THE BOOM CRANE.  THESE WERE THEN REPLACED INTO THE TRAILER INTO A TIGHT FITTING ARRANGEMENT THAT WAS SATISFACTORY TO THE SCHNEIDER TRUCK DRIVER. THE OVERPACK WAS SITUATED WITH THE DRUMS AT THE REAR OF THE LOAD.

MANAGER COOPER CONTACTED MANAGER HUNTER, WHO STATED ONE OF THE CARMEN REPORTED SMELLING AN UNUSUAL ODOR WHILE WORKING AROUND YARD TRACK #206.  UPON INVESTIGATING THE ODOR, MANAGER HUNTER LOCATED TANK CAR UTLX 201924 IN YARD TRACK #206 LEAKING FROM THE TOP AREA OF THE CAR.  THE CAR WAS LEFT IN THE TRACK AND THE AREA SECURED PENDING AN INSPECTION.  THIS CAR ARRIVED YERMO IN THE OGYRB-10 AT 1430 HOURS, TUESDAY, MARCH 12, 1994.  MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE YERMO YARD FACILITY, INSPECTED THE CAR, AND DEVELOPED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE FROM AROUND THE CLOSURE, AND, AS THE PRODUCT CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE CAR.  AMBIENT TEMPERATURE WAS APPROXIMATELY 85 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.  THE PROTECTIVE HOUSING COVER HAD A KEEPER/CLOSURE PIN SEAL, UPH 345991, WHICH WAS REMOVED TO ACCESS THE VALVES.  PRODUCT WAS LEAKING FROM THE LIQUID LINE, PAST THE BALL VALVE, WHICH WAS CLOSED, AND PAST THE AND PAST THE 3 1/2 INCH LINE PLUG, WHICH WAS TIGHT.  THE INTERNAL PRESSURE OF THE CAR WAS DROPPED UTILIZING THE VACUUM RELIEF VALVE, WHICH STOPPED THE LEAK AT THE LIQUID LINE.  THE LIQUID LINE PLUG WAS REMOVED TO VERIFY THE BALL VALVE WAS CLOSED.  TEFLON TAPE WAS PLACED ON THE THREADS OF THE PLUG PRIOR TO REPLACING AND RE-TIGHTENING.  THE CAR WAS THEN LEFT IN PLACE TO ALLOW THE INTERNAL PRESSURE TO REBUILD.  THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE CAR WAS RE-INSPECTED AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT WAS FOUND LEAKING PAST THE THREADS OF THE LIQUID LINE PLUG.  THE INTERNAL PRESSURE OF CAR WAS AGAIN DROPPED AND AGAIN THE LEAK STOPPED.  THE PLUG WAS REMOVED AND THE THREADS RE-TAPED.  ADDITIONAL FORCE WAS USED TO RE-SECURE THE PLUG.  THE CAR WAS ALSO INSPECTED PRIOR TO DELIVERY TO THE ATSF INTERCHANGE, AND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF LEAKAGE.  CONTACT WITH THE SHIPPER DEVELOPED THIS PRODUCT IS LOADED INTO THE CAR UTILIZING A VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM, WHICH, ALLOWS LITTLE OR NO PRESSURE BUILD UP IN THE CAR.  WITH THE DAYTIME AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AT YERMO REACHING APPROXIMATELY 115 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, PRODUCT EXPANSION WOULD BUILD SUFFICIENT PRESSURE TO FORCE THE LIQUID THROUGH A DEFECTIVE VALVE.
