The flight originated out of Waterloo Regional Airport (ALO) with the ground handling of Livingston Aviation.  The ground handlers failed to recognise 2 heaters that were loaded and considered hazardous material.  There were a total of 4 heaters, 2 of which were unused and not considered hazardous material in their original package.  The other 2 heaters had been used and filled with kerosene.  The aircraft then flew without the knowledge of the heaters being in the cargo hold.  At the point in which the equipment for the football team was unloaded the ground handlers at Missoula International Airport/Johnson-Bell Field noticed that there was kerosene fuel that had leaked out of one of the heaters.  The ground handler for Sun Country Airlines at the time of unloading for this flight was North Star Express.  Sun Country Airlines mechanic was then informed about the incident. The mechanic then notified Sun Country Airlines maintenance control and advised the mechanic on what to do with the proper procedures that Sun Country Airlines has in place for a liquid flammable spill.  The mechanic then cleaned the spill up that was contained in the cargo hold of the aircraft per Sun Country Airlines and Boeing task card procedures.  The aircraft was inspected for damage and released for a ferry flight back to MSP where it underwent further inspection.  Upon initial investigation, the company has determined that the vendor for ground handling in ALO failed to detect that they loaded undeclared DG/HAZ onto the aircraft.  No employee working the flight was made aware of the heaters on board prior to landing in MSO.  A full investigation into the matter has been launched and a VDRP has also been filed with the MSP local FSDO.  Please contact Heidi De Hoogh as documented below for additional information as our investigation continues.","Sun Country Airlines shall complete a full investigation into the matter that includes comprehensive fixes and followup audits regarding this incident.  At a minimum, employees will be trained and counseled.  New procedures and processes will be enhanced for vendor communication, training and working with brokers for private charters.  A full report will be available once the investigation is completed by contacting Heidi De Hoogh.",No,BOX METAL,Metal box,BOX MTL,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,SUN COUNTRY AIRLINES,US,

A response crew was summoned, when they arrived donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and entered the trailer.  A 5 gallon container had tipped on its site against the trailer wall and leaked approximately 1 pint of liquid onto the floor.  The spill was cleaned up with a suitable absorbent material and the container overpacked into a salvage container, along with a shovelful of gravel that had been stained under the trailer.  The trailer was then dispatched back to Cincinnati so that the load could be reworked and secured properly.  State of Indiana was notified and assigned incident number 26129 to the file, which they closed immediately due to the small amount leaked and the fact that it was already cleaned up.",The contents of the load were found to be improperly blocked and braced.

Material spilled out from the front of the can. Authorities contacted and spill cleaned up. No injuries, prop damage, or envt impact. Driver was following to close to the vehicle in front of him. EE stated he was traveling approximately 50-75 feet behind the car directly in front of him. EE was approaching a green light at the intersection.  The light turned yellow and he anticipated making it through the light.  The vehicle he was traveling behind stopped at the light. EE had to apply the brakes to avoid a rear end collision.  The abrupt stop caused the material in the roll off can to shift forward breaching the tarp cover and spilling out on to the road. The roll off can contained approximately 20 cubic yard bags of sludge/solid material.  1-2 bags of material spilled between the R/O can and cab with the remaining falling on the ground. Driver called 911 to dispatch police & fire dept. PSC Industrial services division arrived 1 hour after the spill was reported to clean up the spilled material. Authorities closed off the right lane and traffic was directed through the left lane for approx 3 hrs. Spill was cleaned up and all lanes of traffic reopened at 9:45pm and the authorities left the scene. Secondary cleanup continued until 11:30 pm. Eight (8) 55 gallon drums of material were generated in the clean up.    Time Line of Events  6:40pm incident occurred, and driver called his supervisor  Driver calls 911 and police & fire dept are dispatched  PSC industrial services group dispatched (JACA) to clean up site.

The incident was not the result of an equipment failure. Moving forward internal recommendations have been made to require the generator to use bags that are 6 mil in thickness. Use of a roll off can with a front splash guard. Ultimately, additional defensive driver training will prevent a reoccurrence of any future incidents.    Direct Cause  Driver was following to close to the vehicle in front of him. EE stated he was traveling approximately 50-75 feet behind the car directly in front of him.    Root Cause  EE was approaching a green light at the intersection.  The light turned yellow and he anticipated making it through the light.  The vehicle he was traveling behind stopped at the light. EE had to apply the brakes to avoid a rear end collision.  The abrupt stop caused the material in the roll off can to shift forward breaching the tarp cover and spilling out on to the road.    Contributing Factors   The roll off can contained approximately 20 cubic yard bags of solid material.  The roll off can had a splash guard on the rear of the can.  A can with a front splash guard may have contained the material from shifting and spilling out during an unexpected stop.

Shipper representatives, Hepaco, Inc., responded and found approximately 10 pounds of  material had leaked out of NAHX 93904 on the master retarder at DeButts yard, account metal dump hose damaged.  The discharge tube between the B and C hopper chutes became dislodged from the fittings after the master retarder grabbed the car, causing the tube to drop and become lodged in the master retarder spilling approximately 10 pounds of residue material that was left in the tube after being unloaded. Hepaco wrapped the exposed outlet ends to keep any more residual commodity from leaking onto the ground. Visual inspection revealed no obvious defects to pipe to indicate that it was struck by a foreign object. Suspect retaining bolts on the pipe locking ring were loose and when the master retarder grabbed the car to apply a normal brake, the pipe shook loose from the retaining rings and fell into the retarder from the vibration of the car being grabbed which is normal. The dislodged pipe was damaged, car will have to be Home shopped for repair.    All spilled material was recovered and will be returned to the shipper for further handling and disposal.  The loaded move of this car was covered by a hazardous waste manifest, the return residue move which was involved in this release was not moving under a waste manifest due to the limited amount of material remaining in the car.",No additional comments.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Norfolk Southern Railway Company,US,

On Tuesday, 12/20/2011 PTRA was given the permission from the shipper to use a local ER comapany to repair and clean the car. M&M Protection inspected the car and found that the manway gasket was not installed prior to shipment thus causing the car to leak when the product shifted during transport.

MDE blocked the outlet to the stormwater rentention pond, and contacted FCC Environmental of Baltimore, Maryland to respond to perform the cleanup.  FCC Environnmental responded to recover released fuel and utilized vacuum trucks to recover free liquid from impacted stormwater pond(s).  Heavy rainfall at the time of the incident flushed storm sewer system, and FCC Environmental recovered diesel fuel and water from impacted storm drains, and proceeded to recover residuals from the stormwater retention ponds.  Absorbent boom, stay dry, and absorbent material were used to absorb free product within lot.  FCC Environmental proceeded to recover residuals, and returned the following day to containerize spent absorbent material, and excavate impacted soils.

The tank was brought back to the terminal.

BNSF investigation of car movement records of CRDX 6046 revealed that in transit CRDX 6046 was stopped in Dilworth, MN on 11/17/2011 with a bottom outlet mechanical problem. Local mechanical responders reportedly wired closed a partially open bottom hopper outlet on 11/21/2011. A small amount of product spillage under CRDX 6046 was shoveled, followed by local disposal.   After the aforementioned 12/15/2011 notification, a response contractor was requested to have a vacuum truck go to Dilworth railyard and locations entering the railyard to vacuum up any product spillage found (later reporting that an estimated 3000 lbs. was vacuumed). This captured material was earmarked for appropriate disposal. Also, BNSF mechanical personnel were requested to inspect CRDX 6046 at its Decker, MT location and report on the operation of its bottom outlets. Inspection revealed that number 1 and 4 bottom outlet door gate systems would not close properly to securely lock shut due to capstans needing replacement and door gates out of adjustment.  CRDX 6046 was directed to a repair facility after the consignee unloaded and released it.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of bottom outlet door gate systems.,Yes,HOPPER,Rail hopper car for solid materials only,HOPPER R,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,22000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The float was carrying 16 totes of product name Alpha 1427 residue.  The trailer was covered with a tarp designed for the sides to lift up by straps secured over the top rail. During travel one of these straps had been wrapped around a tote valve an worked itself loose and went underneath the rear tires of the trailer and broke the valve off.  This left a trail of liquid approximately 3 miles on the north side of the westbound lane of I-70.  Unit stopped at mm38 after being flagged by another employee.Driver immediately called authorities and local Baker Hughes Management.  Interstate 70 was never closed down. CO DOT provided barriers daily for clean up crews to work in a safe zone. Barriers and signs were used to notify drivers to slow down and travel only in the left hand lane westbound for 3.5 miles.    Clean up was coordinated between Baker Hughes, CURA and CO DOT.  CURA Emergency Services contracted a local company ECOS Enviromental & Disaster Restoration to clean up the spill.

There were ten 300 gallon totes of this material on the trailer and it was reported that the neck of the tote was damaged due to a load shift. ERTS dispatched an environmental contractor to the site to cleanup the released material. After further investigation the environmental contractor determined that the load shift was due to improper preparation for transport. The environmental contractor collected the released material and containerized all of the waste for transportation and disposal.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Ashta Chemicals, local, state and/or federal agencies as applicable were notified via CHEMTREC report 2011-12-24-00025. SWS Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a faulty vacuum relief device mounted on top of the manway. SWS personnel placed a protective covering over the device and decontaminated the tank car. The shipper's representative, Margrett Coots - 440-997-6815 / 440-813-4826, was informed of the source of the leak and arranged for replacement and requalification.     On December 30, 2011 Rescar, SWS Environmental, and CSXT personnel returned to the site to replace the vacuum relief device and requalify the tank car. GATX 90975 was then released from hold status and placed back into transportation.    This incident did require a special switching move.

Vernon hooked up the trailer and began to pressure the trailer when a WR Grace unloading operator noticed a drip coming from the sump.  Everything was shut down.  It was determnined that the sump had a hole in it and was dripping HCL through it and onto the unloading rack ground.  The drip was washed to the WR Grace sump and rubber band was placed over the hole and secured with ties.  The leak stopped.  The trailer was later offloaded successfully and was sent immediatly to the cleaning rack.  The trailer was sent to the shop for repairs.  The repairs were completed and the trailer is back in service.","As noted in the initial report, the tank was within a current, specified HM183 test interval. As the trailer was in dedicated service for HCL, material is loaded  on a ""closed system"" basis. This closed system loading process as well as the nature of the product make internal pre loading inspection difficult to not possible. There was no leakage at the time of loading the cargo tank that was noted.   Post mortem inspection of the cargo tank by the repair facility confirmed that a lining breach in the outer visible failure area of the sump was the root cause of incident. The exact cause of the lining failure is not known at this time however may be possibly  attributed to a disbonding of the lining system with the metal in the area of the sump that occurred over time, or simply a pinhole in the original lining system that existed from the time of the lining application.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,UNIVAR USA,US,

The loader shut down the load and called for the manager. After assessing the situation, the level in the trailer was checked. The high level Scully shutdown was retested twice to ensure it was working properly. The Scully probe was checked to ensure it was set for the proper gallon amount to prevent overload. After this TM started the load back up and attempted to get the meter working using the Scully as a fail safe. During this process the Scully shut down failed and material started coming out of the dome of the trailer. A code yellow was announced and loaders responded to the area with spill response equipment. Sand was applied to the area and cleaned up and placed in a container for disposal.

Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

However, the digital level indication did not match up with the level float and the off load was being managed using only the digital level indication. The off load was stopped at 95% on the digital level gauge while the level in the tank was actually near hydraulic. When the off loading line was blown out it caused a small release of acid out the tank overflow line which resulted in a small spill to the paved area around the tank.The off loading line was immediately isolated and actions were taken to contain spill. The estimated quantity that was released is 57 gallons and of that, an estimated 3-5 gallons reached a nearby process sewer before being dammed off for recovery. The material spilled on the pavement was soaked up with sand/gravel and Oil Dri, and placed in a container, where it was later neutralized, prior to disposal.",We have made the following changes in our procedures to ensure this type of incident does not happen: Train operators to ensure that both level gauges are operating correctly before unloading into storage drum.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,EXXON MOBIL,US,

Upon arrival the driver opened his back door and observed the drum leaking. The driver immediately unstrapped it from the wall of the trailer and flipped it over noting that the drum was relatively light. The driver noticed that there was a bolt protruding from the floor of the trailer that the drum had been loaded on top of and as a result it consequently punctured the bottom of the drum resulting in the unintentional release. For as much of the contents that released there was very little to clean up because the spilled material evaporated rather quickly.

Driver was west­ bound on State Highway 198, just west of the town of Coalinga, in Fresno County. The driver looked in the mirror and saw his pull trailer leaning to the right, as he came to a curve going to the left. The trailer kept leaning to the right. The trailer went all the way over, onto its side. A few seconds later, the truck starting leaning to the right too. Truck 23 also laid over on the right side.    There never was a leak from the liquid load in the pull trailer cargo tank.    700 pounds  or 45½  gallons of sulfuric acid leaked from the truck cargo tank. This was determined by re-weighing the load, following the incident, in Truck 22 at Verdegaal Brothers' truck scale.    When Verdegaal Brothers' HazMat responders arrived at the scene with a vacuum tanker, the crew connected a hose to vacuum the sulfuric acid from the three-inch bottom outlet, which was towards the top of the overturned vehicle. The sulfuric acid was to be vacuumed into Truck 22, which was also a vacuum tanker.   With the responders created a vacuum from Tank 22, sulfuric acid did not transfer.  The sulfuric acid liquid level was below the level of the three-inch bottom outlet, because the truck was on its side.    There is a ball in a cage in a canister at the front of the cargo tank. This is designed to prevent the cargo tank from being overfilled. When the three-inch valve and cam lock at the rear was opened, in the first attempt to vacuum the contents, the cargo? Tank was vented to ambient pressure. Vacuum was started from another truck, to remove the sulfuric acid from the cargo tank. When the vacuum was started, the ball was no longer in position at the top of the cage and sulfuric acid started to siphon out through the canister and bottom hose to the ground.  When this started to occur, Verdegaal Brothers responders shut off the air valve on the green three-inch line. The toggle switch on the air line, which opens the top valve, was at the open position. This was not initially noticed because the switch was on the side of the truck lying on the ground. With closing the air switch and valve, sulfuric acid stopped siphoning out and no additional acid was released.    With the help of two tow trucks, the pull trailer, still with its load of sulfuric acid, was unhitched and pulled upright. The sulfuric acid in the trailer was transferred into Truck 22. Truck 23 was righted on its axles after the sulfuric acid was vacuumed out of the cargo tank. Truck 23 was towed to Verdegaal Brothers' yard in Hanford. The driver was not injured.  State Highway 198 was partially closed to traffic from approximately 10 AM to 6 PM.","The air actuation switches have since been reversed, to where the off position is to the rear. It was not considered when the switches were mounted that the truck would tip over,and the forward momentum would cause the switch to flip to the open position.  By reversing the switch,it is less likely to open if the cargo tank is on its side and moving forward.  The switch is also spring loaded with pressure to keep it in the closed position.    Drivers are currently instructed if there is a problem, break the air line from the switch to the valve, with a pair of dykes or a knife,or pull it off with their hand, and the lack of air pressure will prevent the air vent on top from opening.    Drivers have since been instructed that is forbidden for loaded company trucks to travel on State Highway 198 between Coalinga and San Lucas.    Verdegaal Brothers drivers have subsequently received four hours of truck driver simulator training at College of Sequoias, on driving skills.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,64416,VERDEGAAL BROTHERS INC.,US,
