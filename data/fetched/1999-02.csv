This tank is used to store Dripolene. During storage, a water layer forms in the bottom of the tank. Mobil Chemical periodically contracts Bealine Service Company to remove the water layer from Tank 677 and transports back to Mobil's Houston facility for re-processing. The water is gravity fed from tank 677 into a Bealine Vacuum Tank Trailer. It normally takes 3 to 4 hours to load a trailer. Bealine driver, Tim Watkins, arrived at the Lyondell/ Citgo facility at approximately 8:30 pm on 2/7/99. The Lyondell/ Citgo guard contacted a Lyondell/ Citgo chemical pumper by radio. Mr. Watkins was instructed to proceed to Tank 677. At approximately 9:00 pm, the chemical pumper arrived at tank 677 and gave Mr. Watkins his paperwork, a two way radio and asked Mr. Watkins to contact her when he was finished loading. At approximately 00:15 hours on 2/8/99, while loading trailer 275, material overflowed from the manway. The cause of the spill was mechanical failure of the gauging device combined with human error. During loading, Mr. Watkins stated that he periodically monitored the level in the trailer. The vacuum tanker is equipped with a float gauge. The float gauge stuck giving the driver a false reading on the amount of material in the tank. Mr. Watkins states that he saw the material begin to overflow from the manway and immediately shut off the flow to the trailer. Lyondell personnel were contacted by radio and the area was secured. Allen Timme, Senior Environmental Engineer for Lyondell/ Citgo was contacted and responded to the scene. Mr. Timme took command and took action to protect exposure in the hot zone. Mr. Timme also monitored the decontamination and remediation of the area. After taking immediate action to mitigate the situation, Mr. Watkins contacted the Bealine dispatcher. At the time of the spill, we believed the spilled material was water saturated with Benzene and therefore there was no release of a reportable quantity of a hazardous substance. However, the following morning, Mr. Timme advised Richard Cirillo at Bealine that he had assumed a worst case scenario, i.e., that the spilled material was dripolene and not saturated water. Using the worst case scenario, Mr. Timme calculated that approximately 403 lbs. of benzene had been spilled. (4 barrels x 42 gallons per barrel =168 gallons x 7.5 lbs. per gallon = 1260 total lbs. x 32% = 403 lbs of benzene). The reportable quantity for benzene is 10 lbs. Upon making this determination, Mr. Timme stated that he had notified the National Response Center (report No. 473199), Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (report No. 990266) and further contacted or attempted to contact Harris County Pollution Control, LaPorte, Pasadena and Galena Park LAPC.

COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS CONTACTED BY RMMCC REPORTING A LEAKING CONTAINER AT THE  ICTF INTERMODAL FACILITY, LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA. THE ABOVE 20 FOOT CONTAINER WAS IN THE WALL OF A DOUBLE STACK CAR ALONG WITH AN ADDITIONAL 20 FOOTER. A SMALL POOL (ROUGHLY ONE GALLON )  OF LIQUID WAS ON THE PAVEMENT UNDER THE RAILCAR  AND THE INTERIOR OF THE DOUBLE STACK CAR WAS COVERED WITH THE LIQUID. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO REMOVE THE CONTAINER  FROM THE CAR, AND 'DIAPER' IT TO PREVENT ANY ADDITIONAL LOSS OF PRODUCT WHILE IT WAS MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK FOR INSPECTION. ONCE THE TEAM WAS ASSEMBLED, THE REAR DOORS WERE OPENED. THE LADING CONSISTED OF DOUBLE STACKED 55  GALLON METAL DRUMS.  THE TOP TIER DRUMS WERE LEANING TOWARDS THE REAR DOORS, AND AS LATER DISCOVERED,WAS DUE TO THE  CARDBOARD UTILIZED AS BILEVEL SEPARATION. THE REAR BULKHEADD, WHILE IT APPEARED TO BE WELL CONSTRUCTED, WAS NOT IN CONFORMANCE  WITH THE RECOMMENDED PROTOCOL ADDRESSED  THE ARR BOE 6C FOR THE ACTUAL WEIGHT OF THE LADING.ONCE THE BULKHEAD WAS REMOVED, IT WAS EDIDENT THE CARDBOARD UTILIZED FOR THE BILEVEL SEPARATION WAS INADEQUATE. THE WEIGHT OF THE DRUMS HAD CRUCHED THE CARDBOARD, ALLOWING THEM TO CANT TO THE REAR. ANOTHER FACTOR THAT AFFECTED THIS MOVEMENT WAS THE PLACEMENT OF PALLETS IN THE NOSE OF THE CONTAINER TO FILL A VOID FOR THE TOP TIER. THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE, NOR IS IT AN APPROVED METHOD PER BOE 6C FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. REMOVAL OF THE DRUMS COMMENCED IN ORDER TO LOCATE THE LEAKING DRUM. THE FIRST DRUM AGAINST THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CONTAINER, BOTTOM TIER, WAS DAMAHGED AND HAD LEAKED APPROXIMATELY 30 GALLONS OF PRODUCT. BOTH THE UPPER AND LOWER ROLLING HOOPS HAD BEEN ABRADED FROM THE ADJACENT DRUM. ANOTHER DRUM WAS LOCATED FUTHER IN THE LOAD AND WAS IN THE SAME CONDITION. THE ENTIRE LOAD HAD SHIFTED, AND ROTATED DURING TRANSIT. A TOTAL OF 15 DRUMS HAD LEAKED FROM ABRASIONS TO THE ROLLING HOOPS. AN ADDITIONAL 31 DRUMS WERE FOUND TO BE IN SUCH POOR  CONDITION THAT THEY WERE DEEMED UNFIT FOR FUTHER TRANSPORT. ALL OF THE LEAKING AND DAMAGED DRUMS WERE PLACEDINTO OVERPACKEDS TO SECURE THEM. AS THE ENTIRE LOAD WAS TO BE RETURNED TO THE SHIPPER, A REPLACEMENT CONTAINER, HJCU 742813, WAS BROUGHT IN TO FACILITATE THE  REROAD. ONCE THE RELOAD WAS COMPLETED, THE CONTAINER WAS RELEASED FOR BILLING. THE RAILCAR AND ORIGINAL CONTAINER WERE CLEANED PER THE MANUFACTURERS RECOMMENDATION.
