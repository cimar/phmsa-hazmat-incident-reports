I then tried to tighten the valve plug to see if it was loose.  It was slightly loose but not enough to cause a leak.  I took the plug out and installed some more Teflon tape on the threads and then reinstalled the plug.  I then released the car for service at 1145 hrs.

The 1-cup of material in the protective housing and sides of the car  evaporated and did not require cleanup. There was not any impaction to the ground. The leak was  secured and the car released for transport. This incident did require a special switching move.

There is a curb surrounding the waste storage area. This curb causes a slight, but sharp drop down as you are moving the drum, The employee navigated that drop, and felt the drum ""bounce"". As he was placing the drum behind the truck, he heard liquid running, and noticed liquid being released from the bottom of the drum. When the drum was jarred, it appears that the foot of the drum dolly had punctured the bottom of the drum.  The employee laid the drum on it's side, and positioned the hole so no more liquid would run out. The employee used absorbent pads to stop the liquid, however some if the liquid got into a trench and catch basin.  A Clean Harbors field service crew was called in to complete the clean up. The flied service crew. blocked off the drains from the catch basin, and used the appropriate intrinsically safe pump to remove the liquid and placed that liquid into a new drum. The area was rinsed off, and the rinsate was also placed into that drum. The sludge in the bottom of the catch basin was removed, and placed into a drum along with the absorbent material and used PPE.

Employees offloading supplies from the truck noticed a solvent small. They inspected the truck and found a 3 gallon plastic carboy (31H1) with a small leak. Upon further investigation it was determined that there was a small crack in the drum on the bottom of the container. The leaking drum was overpacked into a 30 1H2 drum to continue transportation to the treatment storage and disposal facility.     The drum leaked less than 1 pint of mixed solvents while in transit due to the crack. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent and the drum was overpacked into an appropriate 30 gallon drum along with the other container of the same material that had not leaked. The duration of release is anticipated to be a small drip from the drum for about 2 hours with no more than a quart leaking.   The Veolia safety manager was immediately notified upon discovery of the spill. The final root cause of the incident was determined to be that a drum had a small  crack in it due to the age of the container. The container had been at the shipper location for quite a while as they had issues with their previous vendor and then switched over to Veolia as a new vendor. The container was inspected prior to shipping and did not have any issues. It appears that the leak was caused when the container was in transit as a very small crack seemed to occur during normal transportation when discovered at end of the trip.","The cause of a spill was that a crack developed in a 3 gallon drum during normal transportation. Veolia employees must continue to inspect drums when handling prior to and during transportation and notify management upon discovery of a leaking container. Veolia will continue to review the causes of spills with employees the best method to overpack a leaking container or to prevent any further leaking of containers. In this particular case, the container was inspected and appeared to be in safe condition to transport as offered. During the investigation, it was discovered that the container was old as the shipper had issues with their previous waste vendor.

CORP DANGEROUS GOODS,1020 Delta Blvd,Atlanta,GA,30354,Carrier,We received a shipment from LHR via ATL of 7 skids. While offloading the shipment from the truck I noticed that one of the skids contained multiple boxes with the Limited Quantities label. There is nothing on the AWB indicating that the shipment is DG in limited quantities. There is no shipper's Dec either and none of the boxes have a UN number. The AWB states in the nature and quantity of goods box that this is a shipment of beauty products. This may be a potential undeclared dangerous goods incident. I have taken photos of both the AWB and the boxes labeled with the limited quantity marks.,"It is difficult to pinpoint one singular issue as to the root cause, there were numerous errors here. The Agent did not declare as dangerous goods, the labels were not noticed on the door by the warehouseman or by the builder who built the flight. It also appears the shrink wrap was very cloudy which could have made it difficult for anyone to spot any HAZ labels. The Agent has not tendered the freight correctly, there are also no hazardous class labels which may have been more obvious to spot.  To conclude this incident, I would suggest the Agent is responsible for presenting the incorrect paperwork and incorrectly labelled cargo. For our part if anything, we could have checked over the cargo with more attention, but I would not say the warehouseman did his role to the best of his ability. As can be seen in the photograph, it would not have been easy to see through the cloudy shrink wrap, there were no DG classification labels and nothing flagged up on the HHT device. The builder would have also had no triggers to alert him the consignment was hazardous, because of this his eye would not necessarily have notice the limited quantity labels either.",No,,,,No,,,,ZZ,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"delta Air Lines, Inc.",US,

The  other end (2”) was connected directly to the customer tank.   • The driver opened the internal valve (and cracked open the external) to begin the unload. o The Schneider trailer has two valves that must be opened to allow for product flow (an internal and external valve).  The internal valve works on hydraulics and is either all the way open or all the way closed.   o The external valve is a hand turn wheel that can be partially opened to get the desired flow rate.  Consistent with our training he ‘cracked open’ the external hand wheel to allow product to slowly fill the hoses and check for product leaks.   o Air pressure was at 15psi (standard air pressure tolerance) • He walked the hose line to the customer tank and didn’t observe any leaks and validated that the customer tank meter was showing that it was receiving product (trickling).   • Robert walked back to the trailer and proceeded to open the external valve the rest of the way. • As soon as the valve was fully open the fitting (one of the camlock arms) connected to our hose broke allowing the hose to release which spilled 20-25 gallons of product before driver was able to shut it down.   •  (Refer to illustrations below) • The camlock arm snapped off at the base where it pivots allowing the hose to become disconnected.    • The driver was startled when the release occurred, and instinctively lunged backwards out of the way, allowing for some product to get under the face shield.   • He quickly shut the internal valve on the trailer to stop product flow and ran to the safety shower.   • The safety shower was ice cold, and the driver stood in for as long as he could tolerate, got out to warm up, called Schneider, and stated he had asked for an ambulance. He got back in the shower one more time and waited for ambulance. o Driver was treated and released the same day without restrictions   Root Cause • The camclock ear failed o There was not a cause visible to the human eye - assume it is metal fatigue. ¿ We learned that driver leaves this fitting attached to the hose for a duration of one month intervals, of which he replaces the gaskets inside the fitting.  In between deliveries the hose and the attached fitting are hanging from the hose rack allowing it opportunity to come in to contact with other parts of the vehicle. Standard practice would be to put into a fitting box.   o There is no trend to this type of failure- first incident   Contributing Factors • Driver was storing his fittings improperly • Driver had difficulty tolerating the temperature of the safety shower","Corrective Actions: • Driver has been coached on properly storing fittings  • We are reviewing this specific fitting at a company shop to ensure there are no missed contributing factors or root cause cause  o Update: Per our shop technician no visible damage could have been seen as part of a visual inspection. Camlock arm failed- no specific root cause/many causal factors- potentially age of the camlock, general use and storage, general wear and tear.  • A fleet macro will be sent reminding drivers not to transport their hoses with fittings attached and to carefully visually inspect camlocks for any signs of damage Submit DAR to Ecolab to request their customer review the water temperature for their emergency shower",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

The weather at the time of the accident was clear, although it apparently rained the day or night before. The accident occurred at 7:07 a.m. Reliable knows this because the truck is equipped with GPS. Between 7:07 and 7:08 a.m., the GPS shows the truck went from 42 mph to 4 mph. At 7:08 a.m., the ignition on the truck turned off. It appears the driver was driving within the speed limit.  The accident occurred when the front wheel of the transport tanker went onto a soft roadside shoulder. The shoulder gave way and allowed the truck to roll down an embankment. Gasoline from the truck began leaking almost immediately and went directly into the Jackson River. The puncture was 1-1/2"" +/- in diameter along the top center of the tanker shell about 2' behind the manhole lid for compartment #1. The driver immediately applied spill pads to capture product leaking from the tanker into the river. There was damage to the front/right corner of the tanker, but no puncture or tear (see attached photo). First responders deployed sorbent booms in the river. DEQ called in W.E.L., Inc., an environmental response contractor. WEL deployed additional booms, and then maintained the booms until cleared for removal by DEQ days later. DEQ determined no soil or other remediation was required. Reliable has calculated that 1,470 gallons were released into the river.","Speed was not a factor.

The shipment originated at Brenntag Southwest in Houston, TX and was transported to Pittsburg, TX in a cargo tank vehicle by Unden Bulk Transportation. The bill of lading number was 129176. Two equipment operators(EO) were coordinating the:unloading of the truck. One EO was stationed with the truck at the remote unloading connection located West of the Administration building. The other EO was stationed at the tank itself, located at the lake. The remote unloading point is connected to the product storage tank by approximately 800 feet of 4-inch diameter CPVC product transfer piping located underground. Both the product storage tank and piping are consignee-owned. The EO atttie truck was responsible for making sure the truck loaded with what we were expecting(sodium hypochlorite 10%, or bleach, seeing that the truck was safely and correciiy hooked up to the connection point The EO at tank was responsible for making sure the valves at the tank it self were lined up correctly. Once the bleach was being moved to the tank, EO at truck contacted EO at tank on the radio to confi,rn that we did have flow to the tank. EO at tank confirmed that indeed, there was bleach flow to the tank. EO at truck and shift supefvisor saw the local level Indicator increase in value. Shift supervisor returned to the EPS office and received a call from maintenance supervisor that a mechanic had noticed what appeared to be a water leak on the Ash Pond side of the road directly West of the Bleach tank. EO at the tank would not have been able to see this from his vantage point at the tank. Shift supervisor called EO at the tank and asked him to walk up the hill and put eyes on the leak. After a short time, he then called to EO at the truck to shut the bleach off at the truck as the leak turned out to be a bleach leak. Shift Supervisor then went to the lake area to check on the leak and several olhers began showing up to inspect. Calls to Environmental Coordinator and plant manager were made. The truckwas relocated to the unloading site adjacent to the product storage tank and the balance of the load was transfei,ed without incident. Calculations performed as to loss of material were done and reportable quantity called in by plant env coordinator to NRC, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality(TCEQ), and Titus Fire Dept.",Bulk tank fill pipe was immediately put out of service. Risk analysis to be perfonned on the replacement of piping forthe remote fill station to continue usage with upgrades on piping and installation practices to be investigated.

The temperature in Winnipeg at that time was around-33 degrees F. After the rail car was loaded, it was pressure tested to 40 PSI for 10 minutes. The rail car was released to the CN Railway later that day. The rail car arrived in International Falls at 00:31 CST on February 23rd. The high temperature in International Falls on February 23rd was 39 degrees F. Border Chemical received a call from Mr. Jared Ginter, Safety Director, Boise White Paper, LLC, at approx. 12:15 CST on February 23rd notifying us that the rail car appeared to be dripping sulphuric acid. Mr. Ginter indicated that the leak was very slow, and he had placed a pail under the rail car to capture the dripping sulphuric acid. We had an experienced driver(Mr. Gerald Parisien-31 years with Border Chemical delivering and handling sulphuric acid) in the area at the time and diverted him to International Falls to investigate the situation. Mr. Parisien arrived on site at approx. 14:00 that day. After donning his PPE, Mr. Parisien climbed up on the rail car and immediately noticed sulphuric acid slowly Ieaking from under the eductor pipe cap and determined that this was a non-accident related release. At that time Mr. Parisian phoned our office and spoke with our plant superintendent, Mr. Greg Zahayko. Based on the area of the leak, Mr. Zahayko determined that due to the extreme temperature fluctuation, pressure had built up in the railcar and this had forced the sulphuric acid up the eductor pipe, causing the leak. Mr. Zahayko had Mr. Parisien tighten the eductor pipe cap approx. ^ tum, and that stopped the leak. Mr. Ginter supplied some Iime to Mr. Parisien, and he spread the Iime under the rail car to neutralize any residue that might have leaked onto the ground. Mr. Ginter disposed of the small amount of acid captured in the pail that was placed under the rail car. Mr. Ginter estimated that approx. 1.5 gallons of sulphuric acid had leaked from the rail car.","In the future when loading sulphuric acid in rail cars during extreme cold weather events, we will ensure that all gaskets on the rail cars are replaced with new gaskets, and not reuse existing gaskets.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BORDER CHEMICAL COMPANY LIMITED,US,

Went over the acid loading procedures with all 5 other RIVR drivers to make sure they understood them and that they are NEVER to touch the loading screen until the spout is in the dome.  2.)  Had an one hour meeting with the driver involved.  We went over the procedures to determine what went wrong.  Driver admits he was thinking steps ahead of himself.    3.)  Driver was given a 3-day suspension and warned that ANY further problems at Chemtrade will result in permanent ban from their property and immediate termination from GTI.  4.)  Phone meeting was held 2/2 with Bobby Lensing at GTI and Craig Tylenda (Chemtrade RIVR Plant Manager).   Follow up meeting will occur next week (to be determined by Plant Manager at Chemtrade) after they have reviewed the incident.  5.)

I proceeded to contain the leaking paint by puting it in hazardous waste bag, tied bag and contents with zip ties and did this twice due to the bag being ripped. After containing the leaking hazmat I then put it in a yellow drum and kept in in the hazmat cage, so I could continue processing the damaged hazmat. DescribePack: Upon inspection of the damaged hazmat I saw it rapidly leaking from the bottom of its metal pail.

It had leaked onto the floor but did not seem to be currently leaking. My inspection of the area I concluded that the can was put onto the IC rollers and tipped over while being pushed. Leaking paint came out of the seam of where the handle connects to the metal pail. Paint leaked on the rollers and onto the floor. Someone stepped in the puddle on the floor and left footprints across the floor for about 5 yards. The can actively leaks out of the handle seam when slightly tipped over. I cannot assess how much has leaked because I cannot open the metal can. Can was moved into the hazmat cage for processing. DescribePack: The seam of where the handle connects to the 5gallon metal pail leaks paint. Reasoning unknown. Small dent on bottom does not seem to be significant enough to affect where the paint is leaking out. cannot inspect further to asses what caused damage or how much leaked due to the type of metal can. it cannot be opened at the facility. Do not have the correct tools.

The driver believes he fell asleep, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. The vehicle crossed two lanes of traffic , ran off the left side of the interstate, struck the concrete median barrier, overturned and crossed into the eastbound lanes of I255. Emergency vehicles responded, extricated and transported the driver to the hospital, controlled traffic, shut down the interstate, and cleaned up any hazardous materials from the roadway. There was diesel fuel on the roadway, primarily from the saddle tanks of the tractor, but there was also a small amount of leakage from a dome on top of the cargo tank. On site environmental responders estimated approximately 15 gallons of diesel fuel had leaked onto the roadway. By 0950, the crashed vehicle had been cleared, scene cleaned up, interstate opened back up, and all emergency vehicles had left the scene.  Emergency response efforts included stopping and securing the dome drip leak by using cribbing for stabilization and diking the fuel spill to contain the spill area to mitigate damages. Another tractor/tanker trailer combination was brought on scene to transfer the hauled product from the crashed tanker to its final destination.","We recommend to remind drivers to ensure they have the proper rest.
