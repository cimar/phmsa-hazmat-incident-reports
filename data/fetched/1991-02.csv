THE DRIVER IN THIS CASE DID PERFORM A WALKAROUND INSPECTION BUT FAILED TO CHECK THE TOP OF THE CARGO TANK.  ONCE LOADED, OUR VEHICLE LEFT THE LOADING AREA AND PROCEEDED ONTO THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY TO GO TO THE SCALES TO BE WEIGHED.  AT THE FIRST INTERSECTION (BUCKEYE RD.

UPON ACCELERATION AND TURNING ONTO S DIXIE OUR DRIVER NOTICED LEAKAGE ON THE REAR OF THE TRAILER.  HE PULLED ONTO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO INSPECT THE CARGO AND FOUND THAT THE REAR FUSIBLE CAP HAD NOT BEEN INSTALLED AND APPROXIMATELY THREE (3) POUNDS OR LESS THAN ONE HALF (1/2) A GALLON OF WASTE WAS SPILLED.  HE INSTALLED THE CAP, THEN RETURNED TO THE LOADING AREA.  HE NOTIFIED THE PATCHEM PERSONNEL AT THE LAODING AREA AND THEY IN TURN NOTIFIED BP OIL.   A CREW FROM BP OIL RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT TO CLEANUP THE WASTE.  THE WASTE WAS SCRAPED UP INTO A BUCKET AND RETURNED TO THE LOADING AREA.  THE WASTE WAS SCRAPED UP INTO A BUCKET AND RETURNED TO THE LOADING AREA.  CALLS TO REPORT THE SPILL, AS NOTED ABOVE, WERE PLACED.

THE DRIVER WAS WARNED ABOUT PERFORMING AN IMPROPER WALKAROUD INSPECTION BUT NOT LOOKING ON TOP OF THE TANK FOR UNSAFE CONDITIONS.  THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS BEING ATTRIBUTED TO DRIVER ERROR.
