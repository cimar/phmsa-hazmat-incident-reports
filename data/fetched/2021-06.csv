The car was isolated and (Linde Inc., NRC, IDEM and were notified.  CHEMTREC Report # 2021-060300364. RMS, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the car venting from the normal venting relief valve vent and valve cabinet. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Michael Bolton 716-435-1606. Contractor personnel opened the cabinet housing and observed ice fall from the valve and the normal venting valve reset and the leak stopped and the product that fell to the ground evaporated quickly so there was no remediation cleanup. The leak was secured by RMS and a Linde Inc. Technician and the car was released for transport pending an OTMA1. This incident did require a special switching move. 7.1 is required.

During the inspection of air waybill 006-44026032, 20.25 liters of an unregistered pesticide (DDVP Sniper) was found concealed within food items contained in this shipment.  When CBP referred this pesticide to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), they refused it.  Based on EPA’s refusal, and the evidence that some of the pesticide containers leaked into the dried leaves concealing them, the entire shipment must be re-exported.  Please see the attached CBP Form 4647.  To the best of my knowledge, all of the pesticides have been removed from the food items and placed into two boxes.  These boxes will need to be properly labeled (the manufacturer states this pesticide to be toxic and flammable) and checked for leakage prior to transport.  I double bagged the bottles exhibiting obvious signs of leakage.  The prohibited items that I previously removed for destruction will be returned to the shipment for re-export tomorrow.  I notified the consignee, Mr. Azubuike Amadi, on June 3, 2021.

He discovered a leaking tank car that was venting a small amount of hydrochloric acid from the top of the car around the valve area. The PUC Inspector notified General Manager at the Bellefonte office that there was an issue with the car. The GM then notified Operations about the issue. Operations STO then responded to Lock Haven to observe the tank car and relieve responsibility from the PUC Inspector for keeping anyone from getting near or injured from the leaking car. The STO took control of the situation once he arrived on the scene from the inspector at that point. While the STO was enroute, the Superintendent was in contact with Univar which is responsible for this loaded car since it was not delivered to PVS, which is where the car was destined for. The Superintendent was able to confirm that North Shore Railroad would need to contact a remediation company to deal with this incident as Univar did not have a response team for such incidents anymore and contacted Enviroserve which was the old Northridge Group we used in the past to deal with hazardous material incidents. He was able to get Enviroserve to dispatch a crew to respond almost immediately from Winfield to Lock Haven. While Enviroserve was responding, the STO  applied track protection to track 5 in Lock Haven for the responding crew.  Enviroserve did respond within an hour and a half to the location at Lock Haven to begin sizing up the situation and begin correction of the issue with the car. Enviroserve’s crew was on scene for about 1 hour and 45 mintues from the time of arrival to the time of departure. Enviroserve corrected the loose bolts that held the vapor housing valve onto the car. It was the bottom flange bolts for the valve that were discovered to be loose. Enviroserve tightened three of the bolts which needed at least ¼ turn to snug up. The fourth bolt needed to be tightened at least ½ a turn to snug up. After the housing was tighten up, Enviroserve then cleaned the outside of the car to remove any residual hydrochloric acid from the outside skin of the car to prevent any injury. It was then agreed that the situation was remediated. After the response crew cleared the track, and the STO then removed the track protection. Both Enviroserve and the STO both left the scene shortly thereafter back for their respective terminals. The GM was contacted by the STO that the issue was resolved and to let him know to keep an eye on the car on future movements to make sure there are no other leaks are discovered with this car.

He stated that they had chemical cars spotted around track 8.  10:15   Slick personnel are on location at this time. After meeting with PTRA rep, we began walking between tracks until the odor was located. Upon locating the odor on empty/residue car number DOWX 34008, Slick personnel gained clearance to climb the car and investigate the cause. After opening the protective housing, I noticed that you could hear air escaping from inside the car around valves. After checking both valves, all bolts on both valves were extremely loose with four bolts with approx .25 inches gap between the nut and the flange. After tightening all the bolts on the valves, there was no more odor coming from the car. At this point, I checked all other bolts and found them to be tightened so we resealed the protective housing and notified Kirk of the findings. Track was released and placed back into service. 12:30   Slick personnel have released the car back in service at this time. 13:30   Slick personnel are parked, and equipment has been placed back into service  Seal # 009549",Notified the shipper and consignee of the issues.

The leaking car GATX36400 had been isolated at the PTRA Pasadena Yard Rail Yard on Track #4. M&M’s emergency response personnel arrived at 2030hrs and begin an assessment of the car. Visual observations indicated a steady flow of Methanol leaking from under the protective dome housing on top of the car. M&M’s Hazmat Team climbed onto the car, opened the protective housing dome lid and observed the 3inch (”) Stainless Steel liquid valve to be in the full open position. Methanol was observed leaking from the 3” valve up through the threads around the 3” Stainless Steel plug. Hazmat Team members closed the 3” liquid valve and the leak immediately stopped. The 3” plug accompanying the valve was checked and found “not” wrench tight. The plug was tightened and secured. M&M personnel stood by and verified that no further leaks were found. To assure a safe and secure load M&M requested the railcar be moved to a siding until daylight to verify that all leaks were repaired. On June 7th, 2021 at 0900hrs. M&M personnel rechecked GATX36400 and verified that there were no active leaks. Mr. Higbie was notified that GATX36400 was releasable for shipment.

The drum was transported to the Safety-Kleen facility located in Springdale, AR. where the drum was placed in 10 Day storage. Springdale, AR. experienced a uptick in temperature causing the warehouse to become much warmer that than when the drum was originally placed. The drum became pressurized due to the heat and the gasket between the open-top lid and the upper drum shoulder failed resulting in the material leaking and running down the drum creating a very small pool of material on the pallet on which the drum sat and the warehouse floor. The cause of the release was found to be from lack of head space in the drum. This leak was discovered during a daily facility walk conducted every morning. The closure ring on the drum was torqued stopping the release. The drum and area affected by the release was remediated by warehouse personnel.",Safety-Kleen Systems management contacted the generator and discussed the necessity of proper head space left in drums. The management team will re-iterate the importance of container inspections prior to accepting drums / containers into our transportation network.

The truck/trailer arrived at the Norlite location from the Veolia, Schenectady, NY location. Liquid was observed coming out the back of the trailer upon arrival in the parking lot at the Norlite facility. The Veolia driver was notified of the leak by Norlite employees and he immediately notified Veolia. The Veolia safety manager and NYDEC were notified of the spill by the Veolia driver. Clean up operations were performed by trained Veolia employees.    Upon inspecting the trailer, employees found debris under the drum that caused the drum to be punctured. It was assumed the leak started on the way into the Norlite facility due to the rough road entering the facility and large leak on the bottom of the metal 55 gallon container. The drum was overpacked into an 851A2 salvage drum to contain the leak and offered to Norlite for proper disposal. Soil that was impacted was also cleaned up.      The drum leaked about half of its contents of mixed solvents due to the hole in the bottom of the drum.  The duration of release is anticipated to be about 60 minutes with about 200 pounds of material leaking. On 6/08/2021 the Veolia safety manager notified the National Response Center to report the spill (Report#1307227). The results of the investigation is that a drum had a hole in it due to sharp debris under the drum that was not cleaned when loading the containers into the trailer. The container was inspected prior to shipping and did not have any issues. The NYDEC was also notified of the spill and responded to it. They were notified around 5:45 PM by Veolia (Spill#2102181).","The cause of a spill was a debris on the floor of a trailer where a 55 gallon drum was placed. The debris and drum were in the front corner of the trailer. While loading it and preparing it for transportation, employees did not clean the debris up. Veolia employees must continue to inspect trailers for debris prior to loading drums onto them. We also had a meeting on June 10, 2021 to review safety procedures and assuring proper housekeeping is done in trailers and at the facility. In addition, we reviewed the protocols for shipping drums to Norlite and also have implemented that drums doing to Norlite will be placed on pallets to prevent this from happening again as well as be safer for employees having to move the drums at the Norlite facility.    Veolia will continue to review the causes of spills with employees to prevent any further leaking of containers. In this particular case, the container was inspected and looked as if it was OK to transport as offered. During the investigation, it was discovered that the container was damaged when being transported across a rough road at the entrance to the Norlite facility. The spill was also reported to the customer/shipper and more care will be used in the future to prevent a similar issue from happening again.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

As a result, approximately 660 gallons of jet fuel released to the concrete surfaces of the runway, aged asphalt surfaces of a parking lot, inside nearby airplane hangar, surrounding soil surfaces of the before mentioned, a water filled ditch, and in a nearby private pond. A representative from National Interstate Insurance (NII) retained Cura Emergency Services, LC (CES), who dispatched a crew from EnviroServe (ES) to provide an assessment. At approximately 7:30 p.m. CDT, a crew from ES arrived on-site. Their assessment noted sand deployed for site containment by local fire department personnel. ES deployed absorbent boom and pads for additional containment, then demobilized, scheduling to return the following day for continued action.  On June 26, 2021, a crew from ES returned to the site. The crew delineated the site and determined an area of approximately 100,000 square feet in need of remediation.

NS then pulled the cars from the refinery and placed them at the Wilds Yard in Wood River.  At the time NS pulled the cars from Phillips 66 and placed them in the Wilds Yard they were not venting.  All four cars were spotted to the industry switch track and interchanged for pickup by Kansas City Southern Railroad (?KCS?) at 7:00 am CT on 5/27/21.  KCS did not arrive for pickup of the cars until 6/2/21. KCS hooked up to the cars in the afternoon of 6/2/21 and, in the process of releasing the brake system, discovered that GATX 231130 was venting.  KCS unhooked, pulled away, and the conductor requested medical assistance and was taken to a local hospital, but was not admitted.  The other three cars (TILX 101963, TILX101981 and TILX 101944) began venting on 6/3/21.  NS mobilized its hazardous materials incident response team to assist the Wood River Fire Department with emergency response on 6/2/21. Phillips 66?s fire department, Madison County Emergency Management/Madison County Hazmat, and the Wood River Police also responded. Remedial measures including water curtains and air scrubbing units were used to mitigate the release from 6/3/21 to 6/7/21.  On 6/7/21 and 6/8/21 responders replaced/repaired components of the pressure relief devices (?PRDs?) on the tank cars.  At 7:00 pm CT on 6/8/21 all four tank cars were moved back into the Phillips 66 refinery.  The tank cars began venting due to Phillips 66?s spent sulfuric acid undergoing a polymeric reaction, which created overpressurization that released through the PRDs on the four tank cars.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,Yes,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,975000,NORFOLK SOUTHERN,US,

The caller requested a contractor to inspect the lid to see if it only requires replacement or to advise if product needs to be transferred into a new tote due to damages to the tote. ERTS dispatched Patriot Environmental to conduct cleanup operations. On July 14, 2021 at 1045 EST, Patriot arrived onsite and confirmed 1 cup of product released to the top of the tote and dried there. The contractor stated the tote cap was inspected and found to be very loose but not damaged. The crew wiped down the impacted area of the tote with soda ash and water solution and re-tighten the cap. They then got a forklift to perform a slosh test to confirm security. Once confirmed there would be no more release the crew left site.

The car was isolated and the shipper, National Response Center, and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2021-0610-00023). Marion Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found Hydrochloric Acid adjacent to the pressure relief device. Upon further inspection, all other service equipment was properly secured, and 60 psig was observed via accessing the vapor valve. The pressure was relieved from the car, and the fill port was open and liquid product was observed approximately 6 inches above the shell of the tank car. This confirmed the tank car was offered in transportation without the required outage. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Mr. Doug Nestler of Univar, phone 408-221-4964. Contractor personnel secured the car, cleaned and neutralized all spilled material and arranged to have product unloaded from the car.

The hook up is 4 feet off the ground, goes up another 4 feet, then over 25 feet, then up another 8 feet and the elbow goes in to a building. • Driver was following protocols when uncapping their line.  He was uncapping the fill line away from him.  He released one of the camlock ears slowly and as he started to remove the cap product sprayed out like it was under pressure and he quickly locked that camlock back down.  1-2 cups released.   o Presumably this residue that was in the line was under pressure from sitting in the heat.   • He immediately started showering down as all his PPE was covered with these droplets including his hard hat and face shield.  He believes as he was taking off his PPE that it rinsed off his hard hat on to his chest, ran down to his stomach, then must have transferred to his bibs and impacted his ankle.  Nothing else in between was impacted.  None of this was known on the initial shower.   • Driver then was told that the last delivery the tank was filled to capacity and they had to do a wet break and is likely how some product was in the line.  However, my challenge to that is that the fill line is vertical with no shut off so when that last one delivered anything in the line should have come out.  Perhaps with the 25 feet of horizontal piping it took some time for that to get down to the connection point.   • That said, he felt comfortable popping the cap off in to his bucket this time around and roughly ½ cup came out (not under pressure this time) in to his bucket.   • As they started unloading he noticed some burning sensation and told the plant who told him he could shower again which he did with soap.  Afterwards now he feels fine, just some redness on the impacted areas. Triage Now was notified and determined that he didn't need to go in unless his symptoms got worse.  • He finished that unload and the next one before calling in which I coached him on.  He felt because the plant was ready to continue and he felt ok that he could report it afterwards.  I told him that we didn’t want him making that determination especially after the shock of having it happen isn’t the best time to be making any self-diagnosis.  He agrees that with that mentality.   • He did have on all the correct PPE at the time of the incident  (chemical suit, chemical boots, chemical gloves, hard hat, face shield, goggles.",The customer has shut down the delivery tank until a fill line shut off is installed on the tank.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

The force of the tote falling off the truck caused the body to burst releasing all the contents of the package. Upon discovery of the release, inert material was used to absorb and contain the liquid. TAS Environmental was then contacted and requested to provide emergency response services. A crew was dispatched to the location and arrived about 17 hours after the incident occurred. The crew used a skid steer loader to scrape the top layer of impacted soil and absorbent. All waste generated was removed from the site and staged for disposal.","In order to prevent an incident like this from happening again, our company has improved operating procedures in the following ways. Two straps rather than one are used per tote and are placed on the outside edge rather than the middle. This puts less stress on each strap, and it prevents the tote from buckling under tension and causing the straps to move from side to side. Strap protectors will, also, be used to provide an additional layer of protection against any edges that might cause wear. Additionally, our stock of backup straps was increased to ensure worn ones can always be immediately replaced.",Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,PINE ISLAND CHEMICAL SOLUTIONS,US,

The source of the odor was unknown at the time of initial report. The KCS Environmental& Hazmat Department mobilized a railroad qualified response contractor to investigate the odor. Upon arrival, the response contractor Identified residue tank car UTLX 208596(PETROLEUM DISTILLATES, N.O.S., UN1268, Haz Class 3, PG I) as the source of the odor. The release was emanatlng from the recloslng pressure relief device(PRD). The PRD's O-Rings were in poor condition, thus allowing vapor to escape. Estimated release Is 0.01 gallon. New O-Rings were installed. The remaining closures, fittings and valves were checked for securement and after verifying the car was secure, UTLX 208595 was released. Shipper is responsible for OTMA to shop for PRD requalificatlon. File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated based on the best information available at the time of filing. This shipment was offered as a'bulk' shipment, aka one car load, therefore the exact amount offered In this package Is not known to the carrier. This carrier does not have access to mass balance data which can exactly quantify this value.","The Kansas City Southern Railway(KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases(NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can caus6 personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adJacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases(a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper Is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.(Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

The forks of the forklift were tilted upwards roughly 3-5 inches instead of being flat. The point of the left fork punctured the poly bladder of the tote. This slit caused acid to leak out of the tote. The slit was 1-3 inches above the base of the tote, 1-3 inches above the 1 st metal ring around the bottom of the tote that sits on the base, and bent the metal framing that runs diagonally in the middle of the tote. The slit allowed for 2 streams of acid to leak from the tote. The 11ow pressure of the release was about equivalent to a drinking fountain. All individuals working on the 10-Day clock stopped work, notified project manager who was still at the facility, and created a barrier with oil dry around the damaged tote to contain the release enough for someone to employ sausage boom. Boom was then placed around approximately 15ft x 12ft area of concrete on the dock. A pump was utilized to pump the product out of the damaged tote into a new, compatible tote with the same specs as the damaged tote. Soda ash was used to neutralize the leaked phosphoric acid on the concrete. Personnel utilized properly rated tyvek suits with boot covers, properly rated gloves, and respirators to remove the material. Soda ash was poured onto the concrete and slowly mixed in with the acid to neutralize the pH and solidify the liquid. The dean up debris was scraped and shoveled into 55 gallon poly drums as well as all used pig pads, boom, and PPE. No more than 50 gallons of acid leaked from the damaged tote. The hole in the tote was less than one inch in' depth and approximately 2.5 inches in diameter. The leak did not go outside of the 15ft x 12ft area and was contained to just the concrete on the 10-Day dock. No injuries occurred from the release. The release was contained within 15 minutes of the tote being damaged. Material was repacked within 30 min. Spill","covered forklift safety and spill response procedures and included all personnel of the Technical Services Department out of the Wood River office. A forklift training refresher course will help prevent future incidents of this type. This material shipped with waste code D002(RQ= 100 lbs.). Phosphoric Acid Solution(75%) weighs about 13.1 lbs/gallon. That said, the 50 gallons that leaked weighs about 655 lbs., which is over the RQ for this material. However, this event is exempt from RQ reporting as the material did not enter environment(the material leaked onto concrete and was contained fully within 15 minutes). Reporting is also excluded under the definition of'Release' at 40 CFR 302.3. Finally, EPCRA also exempts this release under 40 CFR 355.31(a) as there was no exposure beyond the boundaries of the facility.",No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,HERITAGE ENVIRONMENTAL SRVS,US,

Once shutoff the estimated amount spilled was 5-8 gallons that was then cleaned up by the Greenwood facility team. Upon further investigation, the end of the connected hose had a crack in the fitting that allowed the Sodium Hypochlorite to leak out once pressurized.","All hose were inspected for each tanker onsite at JCI Jones Chemicals in Beech Grove, IN.
