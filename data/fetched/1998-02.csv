DRIVER MISSED THE ENTRANCE TO THE FACILITY AND WAS FORCED TO DRIVE APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE PAST THE ENTRANCE TO CHANGE DIRECTION. DRIVER ENTERED THE FACILITY - HOWEVER WHEN ENTERING FACILITY FROM THIS DIRECTION, THE TRUCK PASSED OVER A ""DIP"" IN THE ROAD. THIS ""DIP"" JARRED SEVERAL CONTAINERS HOLDING THE PRODUCT ABOVE. AS DRIVER BACKED INTO THE BAY DOOR OF THE GARAGE, EMPLOYEES NOTICED A LIQUID LEAKING FROM THE TRUCK. BEING A SMALL SPILL, THE DRIVER AND GARAGE EMPLOYEES MADE A CONTAINMENT BERM OUT OF ""OIL-DRY"". THIS CONTAINMENT BERM, ALONG WITH THE SECUREMENT OF THE CONTAINERS STOPPED THE FLOW OF THE SPILL. THE REGULATORY DIVISION OF TAYLOR LABORATORIES WAS IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED. ONCE ON THE SCENE, TAYLOR LABORATORIES, INC. EMPLOYEES THOROUGHLY COVERED THE SPILLED LIQUID WITH SODIUM BICARBONATE TO NEUTRALIZE THE SPILL. SODIUM BICARBONATE WAS SPRINKLE NOT ONLY ON THE GROUND BUT WAS SPRINKLED ON THE INSIDE OF THE TRUCK, ONTO THE CONTAINERS, AS WELL AS ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRUCK. ONCE THE SPILL WAS NEUTRALIZED,THE ""OIL-DRY"" AND SODIUM BICARBONATE WAS SWEPT UP AND PLACED IN PLASTIC BAGS (THESE BAGS WERE THEN TAKEN TO TAYLOR LABORATORIES, INC. FOR TREATMENT). THE CONTAINERS IN QUESTION WERE PLACED IN SEALED PLASTIC BAGS FOR TRANSPORT BACK TO TAYLOR LABORATORIES, INC. FOR TREATMENT. ONCE GROUND BELOW THE TRUCK WAS CLEARED, THE TRUCK WAS MOVED APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET AND THE FLOOR OF THE TRUCK WAS GIVEN ANOTHER COAT OF SODIUM BICARBONATE TO ENSURE THAT ANY RESIDUAL ON THE BOTTOMS OF PALLETS IN THE TRUCK WOULD BE COMPLETELY NEUTRALIZED. THE CONTENTS OF THE TRUCK WERE THEN PROPERLY LOADED AND SECURED. ONCE THE TRUCK WAS MOVED, THE GROUND WAS COMPLETELY RE-SWEPT TO ENSURE THAT NO CONTAMINATE REMAINED. CLEAN WATER WAS THEN POURED AROUND THE CONTAINMENT AREA (THIS WOULD SHOW ANY AREAS THAT CONTAINED ANY RESIDUAL SULFURIC ACID - IF THE WATER ""BUBBLED"" IT INDICATED SOME SULFURIC REMAINED. ANY AREAS THAT SHOWED SIGNS OF RESIDUAL WERE TREATED WITH SODIUM BICARBONATE. THE ENTIRE AREA WAS THEN TREATED WITH PH STRIPS TO ENSURE THAT THE ENTIRE ARE OF  THE SPILL HAD BEEN NEUTRALIZED TO A PH WITHIN A RANGE OF 6-8. ONCE THE AREA WAS CLEAN AND CLEAR, THE TRUCK WAS RETURNED TO TAYLOR LABORATORIES, INC. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT TWO EMPLOYEES FOLLOWED BEHIND THE TRUCK TO OBSERVE ANY SIGNS OF LEAKAGE WHILE IN ROUTE. ONCE AT TAYLOR LABORATORIES, INC., THE CONTENTS OF THE TRUCK WERE CAREFULLY REMOVED AND BROUGHT INSIDE THE FACILITY FOR CLEAN-UP. THE TRUCK WAS THEN IMMEDIATELY SENT TO A LOCAL CLEAN-UP SHOP FOR PROPER CLEANING INSIDE AND OUT (AS IS REQUIRED BY 49 CFR 177.858, ACCIDENTS INVOLVING CLASS 8, CORROSIVE MATERIALS). IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE PROPER AUTHORITIES WERE CONTACTED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.

ALL CONTAINERS APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION. LACY'S DRIVER IMMEDIATELY TELEPHONED LACY'S TERMINAL IN PEDRICKTOWN, NJ TO REPORT LEAKAGE. THE DRIVER WAS TRAVELING PAST LANCASTER, PA ON ROUTE 30 WEST JUST BEFORE WHERE 30 & 283 MEET. LACY'S TRACTORS ARE EQUIPPED WITH CELLULAR TELEPHONES JUST FOR THIS TYPE OF SITUATION. LACY'S TRAILER CONTAINED BOTH HAZARDOUS AND NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE. UNKNOWN WHAT WAS LEAKING AT THAT TIME. LACY'S IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED SAFETY KLEEN. SAFETY KLEEN (TREVOR BAILER) INFORMED LACY'S THAT THEY WOULD RESPOND AND HANDLE THE SITUATION. LACY'S DRIVER ISOLATED THE VEHICLE AND WAITED FOR RESPONSE PERSONNEL. DRIVERS ARE TRAINED NOT TO STOP BY STORM DRAINS OR STREAMS, PULL OVER IN A SAFE AREA AND CONTAIN THE SPILL USING THEIR SPILL CONTROL KIT. SAFETY KLEEN NOTIFIED ALL APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL (FIRE, EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND DEP). IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE SPILL RESPONSE TEAM THAT TWO CONTAINERS WERE LEAKING. THEY WERE OVERPACKED. THE CONTAINERS WERE PICKED UP FROM THE GENERATOR PORTER INSTRUMENTS, 246 TOWNSHIPLINE ROAD, HARTFIELD, PA BY SAFETY KLEEN, TRANSPORT #1. LACY'S EXPRESS PICKED THEM UP AT SAFETY KLEEN IN WEST CHESTER, PA IN ORDER TO TRANSPORT TO EAST CHICAGO, IN. ACCORDING TO THE RESPONSE TEAM THE CONTAINERS APPEARED TO BE GOOD HOWEVER THEY WERE BADLY RUSTED BUT PAINTED OVER SO YOU COULD NOT EASILY DETECT A BAD CONTAINER. ALSO THERE WERE METAL SHAVINGS IN THE CONTAINERS. WHEN TESTED THE MATERIAL WAS ABOUT 98% WATER. JEFF YORTY FROM THE PA DEP WAS ON THE SCENE. WILLIAM GURNEY, GENERAL MANAGER OF LACY'S EXPRESS CONTACTED MR. YORTY CONTACTED MR. YORTY THE FOLLOWING DAY AS A F FOLLOW UP TO SEE IF ANYTHING ELSE WAS NEEDED FROM LACY'S END. MR. YORTY SAID EVERYTHING WENT WELL BUT WAS BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION BECAUSE OF ALL THE RESPONDERS THAT WERE NOT NEEDED. CLEAN UP WAS COMPLETE BY THE RESPONSE TEAM HMHTTC AND THE DRIVER WAS ON HIS WAY BY 8 PM THAT EVENING. THERE WAS NO FURTHER LEAKAGE.

BOTH DRIVERS PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE LAIDLAW (FS) DRIVER FOUND A SAFE PLACE TO PARK HIS TRUCK AND TRAILER. AT THIS TIME THE LAIDLAW DRIVER WAS INFORMED THAT THE TANKER #305 (VIN#5431ARCO) WAS SPATTERING FLUIDS AND THAT MATERIAL WAS RECEIVED ONTO THE AUTOMOBILE OF STEVE MORRIS WHILE THE VEHICLES WERE IN MOTION. THE LAIDLAW (FS) DRIVER CONFIRMED THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM AND ASSESSED THAT THE WING NUTS ON THE FRONT DOME LID HAD BECOME LOOSE DURING TRANSIT AND APPROXIMATELY ONE GALLON OF MATERIAL HAD LEAKED FROM THE DOME LID IN THE CROWS NEST. THIS WAS THE SOURCE OF THE MATERIAL BEING BLOWN IN A FINE MIST FROM THE TOP OF THE TRAILER. THE LAIDLAW (FS) DRIVER IMMEDIATELY ATTEMPTED TO CLEAN THE VEHICLE OF MR. MORRIS WITH ABSORBENT PADS AND MR. MORRIS WAS INFORMED OF THE TRUCK NUMBER AND DRIVERS NAME. MR MORRIS WAS GIVEN A CONTACT NUMBER FOR THE COMPANY AND INFORMED THE DRIVER THAT HE WAS GOING TO A CAR WASH IMMEDIATELY AND WOULD CONTACT THE COMPANY AFTER HIS VEHICLE WAS CLEANED. THE LAIDLAW (FS) DRIVER PROCEEDED TO CLEAN THE MATERIAL FROM THE CROWS NEST AND SIDES OF THE TANKER AND TIGHTENED THE WING NUTS ON THE DOME LID. AT THIS POINT THE DRIVER BELIEVED THAT THE MATERIAL WAS SAFE TO MOVE AND PROCEEDED TO A PHONE. THE DRIVER CONTACTED SAN ANTONIO AT 12:30 P.M. AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT. THE DRIVER INDICATED THAT THE TANKER WAS OPERATIONAL AND HE WOULD PROCEED TO SAN ANTONIO, MAKING FREQUENT STOPS TO CHECK THE DOME LID WING NUTS. COMPLETION OF THIS DELIVERY WAS MADE TO LAIDLAW ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES (SAN ANTONIO), INC. WITH NO FURTHER LOSS OF MATERIAL. UPON RECEIPT AT THE FACILITY TANKER 305 WAS REMOVED FROM SERVICE (FEBRUARY 25, 1998). THE TANKER WAS SENT FRUEHAUF TRAILER OPERATIONS, INC. FOR MECHANICAL EVALUATION AND RE-CERTIFICATION ON MARCH 2ND DURING RE-CERTIFICATION THE FRUEHAUL'S STAFF WAS CONSULTED ON THE SUSPECT DOME LID'S MECHANICAL INTEGRITY AND WAS ASKED TO GIVE OPINIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A THREE WING NUT SECURING SYSTEM (REFERENCE PHOTOS 1-4) FRUEHAUF INDICATED THAT THE FASTENING SYSTEM WAS ADEQUATE TO PROVIDE A SECURE AND TIGHT SEAL OF THE DOME GASKET TO THE TANKER. FRUEHAUF COULD NOT DETECT ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE FRONT DOME LID OR GASKET ON TANKER 305 NOR COULD THEY DEVELOP ANY THEORIES THAT WOULD SUBSTANTIATE THE ABILITY OF THE WING NUTS TO BECOME LOOSE IF PROPERLY SECURED. TANKER 305 WAS RE-CERTIFIED ON MARCH 6TH AND RELEASED TO SERVICE ON MARCH 9TH . THE LAIDLAW (FS) DRIVER MADE A STATEMENT REFLECTING THAT THE DOME LIDS WERE SECURED BEFORE DEPARTING THE SHIPPERS SITE.
