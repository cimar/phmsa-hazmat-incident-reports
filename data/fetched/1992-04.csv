THE HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INVOLVED WAS N-SERVE 24 NITROGEN STABILIZER, A FERTILIZER ADDITIVE, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS A COMBUSTIBLE LIQUID.  OUR TRUCK CONTAINED A 300 GALLON CAPACITY STAINLESS STEEL MINI-BULK TANK WITH 140 GALLONS OF N-SERVE 24 NITROGEN STABILIZER INSIDE. WHEN THE TRUCK OVERTURNED THE MINI-BULK TANK ALSO TURNED OVER AND BEGAN LEAKING N-SERVE 24 NITROGEN STABILIZER OUT OF THE FILL HOLE COVER GASKET. APPROIMATELY 116 GALLONS OF N-SERVE 24 LEAKED ONTO 2 PALLETS OF CALCIUM NITRATE FERTILIZER (80 X 50 LB. BAGS = 4,000 LBS.)

OUR NEW LONDON, MO LOCATION MANAGER AND 2 EMPLOYEES ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 6:30 PM TO CLEANUP THE MATERIAL UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE ST. CHARLES COUNTY HAZMAT TEAM.  THE HAZMAT TEAM HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY THE O'FALLON POLICE DEPARTMENT WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE TRUCK WAS DISPLAYING 1993 PLACARDS. OUR EMPLOYEES REMOVED ALL CONTAMINATED MATERIAL FROM THE TRUCK BOX AND PUT IT IN PLASTIC RECOVERY BAGS.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF N-SERVE 24 NITROGEN STABILIZER WAS FOUND IN AN INDENTATION OF THE RAODSIDE DITCH WHEN THE TRUCK WAS UPRIGHTED.  THE N-SERVE 24 AND THE CONTAMINATED SOIL FROM THIS INDENTATION WAS CLEANED UP AND PUT IN 3 PLASTIC RECOVERY BAGS.  ALL CONTAMINATED MATERIAL WAS CLEANED UP BY 11:30 PM AND THIS MATERIAL WAS HAULED TO OUR NEW LONDON, MO WAREHOUSE.  THE MATERIAL WILL BE STORED THERE UNTIL ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE MADE FOR RPOPER DISPOSAL. THERE WAS NO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS PACKAGING FAILURE IN THIS INCIDENT.

LYLE GOETTSCH'S BURMEISTER FARM.  THE UNIT CONSISTED OF A GMC 3/4 TON PICK-UP PULLING A 1450 NURSE TANK ON A STANDARD RUNNING GEAR. THE DRIVER PROCEEDED FROM THE PLANT TO THE FARM USING THE COUNTRY ROAD SYSTEM WHICH ARE GRAVEL ROADWAYS.  IN SPRING OF THE YEAR THESE ROADS TEND TO HAVE SOFT SPOTS AND LOOSE GRAVEL AREAS DUE TO THE WINTER FREEZING AND THAWING CYCLES. MR. LAFRENZ CRESTED A SMALL HILL AND MY THEORY IS THAT THE PICK-UP GAINED A LITTLE SPEED AND THEN HIT A PATCH OF LOOSE GRAVEL.  THE TRAILER STARTED TO FISHTAIL WHICH CAUSED THE LIQUID TO MOVE IN A SIDEWAYS DIRECTION THUS ENHANCING THE FISHTAIL OF THE TRAILER THUS CAUSING EXCESSIVE SIDEWAYS MOVEMENT OF THE LIQUID CAUSING THE TANK TO TURN OVER. MR. LAFRENZ STATED HIS SPEED WAS 20-25 MPH AND IT WAS ALL HE COULD DO TO KEEP THE PICK-UP STRAIGHT.  HE LET THE DRAGGING ACTION OF THE OVERTURNED TANK STOP THE UNIT AND THE SHORT DISTANCE OF THE TRACKS CONFIRMS HIS SPEED STATEMENT. WHEN MR. LAFRENZ DETERMINED IT WAS SAFE FOR HIMSELF TO REMAIN ON THE SITE HE RADIOED FOR ASSISTANCE.  THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED ALONG WITH THE COUNTY SHERIFF DEPARTMENT AND MYSELF.  THE SITE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS SECURED AND PRODUCT ESCAPING FROM THE DAMAGED VALVE WAS CONTROLLED.
