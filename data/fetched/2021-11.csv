At 1815 EST E3 arrived onsite and confirmed that approximately 270 gallons of product was released over a span of 30 miles. Due to heavy rain the ETA onsite determined the material would not be recoverable. A vac truck was utilized to collect as much impacted rain water as possible. The remaining 5 gallons in the tote was also collected. The impacted trailer floor was cleaned and decontaminated. EnviroServe sprayed the impacted pallets with water and citric clean then wiped them down and used them for spacers while reloading the trailer. Once the trailer was reloaded and secured the unit departed site.

He requested assistance and transferred the contents of the tote into another tote.  Once the contents of the container were transferred, Veolia employees then sent the non-leaking tote (IBC) to the Stablex facility in Quebec, Canada so it could be offloaded and properly disposed of. The Veolia employee investigated the source of the leak and it was apparent that the leak was at the bottom outlet valve of the tote. The age of the tote was estimated to be about 7 years based on the UN specification markings. It is assumed that the corrosive liquids degraded and damaged the IBC and allowed liquid to leak out around the outlet valve. It is estimated that about 1/2 a liter of liquid leaked into the box van. No liquid made it outside of the box van and the liquid on the truck floor was cleaned up. The empty IBC was also sent for proper disposal at an authorized facility.","Veolia will continue to monitor shipments from this customer as well as others to see if there are any additional issues and will also be more vigilant with any totes that appear to be in a degraded condition.

While the operator of the forklift was maneuvering the load, the pallet grazed one of the two 5 gallon poly jericans which caused a small pin size puncture resulting in a leak.  The employee did not initially notice the leak and the container leaked for roughly 10 minutes when the employee smelled an odor.  Roughly 0.5 gallons had leaked during that time span.   Once the spill was identified, the absorbent pads and oil dry was placed on the spilled material.

After completing all checks consistent with FMI Miami and BJ Cecil Trucking requirements, driver left the property en route to FMI Safford. Driver drove approximately 75 miles SE on US 70 where the driver stopped to make a left hand turn, heading East on Norton Rd. The liquid surging in tanker from the stop, caused the Pressure Relief Device (PRD) to activate which resulted in a small amount of SA released on to the roadway. Driver turned East on Norton Rd. for roughly 1 mile where driver was approaching the intersection of Norton Rd. and Reay Rd. Driver slowed and noticed a mist coming from tanker. Driver immediately pulled over to investigate and confirmed SA leaking from tanker.Emergency response was activated. Driver contained area and tanker. Driver discovered the leak originated from PRD valve and communicated to emergency response team. AZ DPS arrived onsite and made a report. The duration of the release is estimated to be less than two minutes. The only know release of acid occured on the stop sign of US-70 and Norton Rd. as well as where the driver ultimately stopped on Norton Rd., near Reay Rd. A total of <4 gallons released. In-house Emergency Crew arrived on site and saturated all areas, several times, where SA was released on to the roadway with water and soda ash. Tanker was also saturated and treated to neutralize SA. PRD Valve was removed and replaced with a new PRD valve by Emergency Crew. Driver was cleared to proceed to offload location, FMI Safford.  Per our RI:  The failed PRD valve was brought into our shop and bench tested. The result was the PRD failed due to a weak spring.","Actions preventing recurrence of this issue has already been taken by the company. The PRD valve that failed was one of two devices installed on our tankers. The remaining tankers in our fleet have ""Girard"" PRD's.

The substance was found on the underside of the unit and the top and sides of the bottom   stack unit and smelled strongly of a paint/epoxy odor. US Ecology was contacted to respond/remediate and found a pallet of 7   gal buckets of UN1263 paint (hazardous) had one bucket on the bottom with corner damage and a small hole from which approximately 6.5 gal of product had leaked out.  US Ecology returned to SSE with a forklift and removed cargo from the unit to gain access to the leaking area. They were able to isolate the source of the leak as a metal pail of ""Milesi"" paint on the bottom layer of a pallet that had creased and split open at the bottom of the bucket, most likely from heavy cargo placed on top of the entire stack; it appears approximately 6.5   gal of paint had leaked out of the 7   gal bucket.

On the behalf of the shipper, United Pumping was contacted and dispatched to complete inspection and any necessary remediation.  Inspection of the parking stall revealed approximately 10   15 gallons of product lost outside of the unit while Interior inspection revealed a palletized shipment to include IBC totes in a 2 X 2 offset pattern. Longitudinal and doorway securement was provided by the use of Tygard. The source of the leak was determined to be originating from a 330   gallon tote loaded with Corrosive Material carrying a class 8 UN 1824 placard. Approximately 50 gallons of the product were lost before the completion of the remediation. The cause of the leak was the result of failed packaging within the IBC tote which also resulted in contaminating cargo directly adjacent to the tote. As a result, the container required extensive cleaning on both the interior and exterior before allowing to out gate.","Inspect packages before, during and after loading for potential damage.",No,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4000,BNSF - BNSF Railway Company,US,

Then, while attempting to transfer the client waste to the Ingenium trailer, the employee failed to recognize that the truck's lift gate was not level and pushed the cubic yard box with the cans atop onto the lift gate. This action resulted in the pallet jack shifting which in tum, caused the waste colorant cans to fall, one of which released its contents. The employee immediately obtained assistance and took appropriate measures to contain the spill. The released material was promptly removed from the parking lot surface. At no time did any spilled material reach any storm drains. The spilled material was appropriately packaged into a cubic yard box for transport and the generator was notified of the incident.   As a result of Ingenium's internal investigation, it was determined that the involved employee was a trainee who acted, of their own accord, outside of their current level of training.","After a thorough internal investigation, Ingenium's Corrective Action Team issued the following corrective actions to prevent a recurrence:   1. The involved employee was counseled regarding the the proper preparation of waste containers for transport, the proper movement of waste from the client site to the Ingenium trailer, the proper procedures for utilizing mechanical assistance devices, and the proper process for loading waste onto the trailer.   2.

The material was picked up on November 10, 2021 by Clean Earth as part of a sub-contracted milk run transport from the generator's facility at 625 W. Illinois Avenue, Aurora, Il. It was held at a 10-day in-transit location in Gary, Indiana. On November 12, 2021, Clean Earth stopped at the R3 Environmental Management facility in Elgin, Illinois (with the IBC on board), then proceeded to the DS Container facility at 1789 Hubbard Ave., Batavia Illinois. During the transport from Gary, IN and at the stop in Elgin, Illinois, no sign of failure of the tote or release of material was noted. When the shipment stopped at the Batavia, IL location, the driver discovered that material was actively Ieaking from an approximately 6 inch long crack in the bottle of the IBC Some of the release material escaped from the vehicle and pooled in an area of asphalt pavement beside the vehicle. Plastic sheeting and vermiculite was initially used to control the spread of the material that had exited the vehicle. A hazardous material response contractor(HazChem Environmental Corporation, Addison, IL) was contacted to assist in clean-up of the incident. At 1043 notification was made to 911 dispatch,. At 1100 the Batavia Fire Department arrived on the scene. At 1135 a representative of the Batavia Water Department arrived and confirmed that no surface water or surface water conveyances had been impacted by the release. At 1150, HazChem arrived on site and under the direction of R3 Environmental, commenced with clean-up. Clean-up entailed neutralization of spilled waste, collection of contaminated debris, transfer of remaining waste in the failed tote to a new tote, dismantlement of the old tote for disposal, and pressure washing the affected asphalt area. The pressure wash water was also collected for disposal.","pressure on the bottle of the tote.
