AFTER EXINTING THE TRUCK THE DRIVERS NOTICED THAT SOME LIQUID MATERIAL WAS LEAKING FROM THE TRUCK ONTO THE ASPHALT PARKING LOT.  UPON OPENING THE TRUCK DOORS, THE DRIVERS NOTICED THAT FOUR CONTAINERS APPEARED TO HAVE LEAKED AFTER CROSSING OVER THE SPEED BUMPS IN THE PARKING LOT. APPROXIMATELY TWO GALLONS OF WASTE MATERIALS LEAKED INSIDE THE TRUCK FLOOR.  THE LIDS AND LID RINGS OF THESE DRUMS WERE APPARENTLY DEFECTIVE WHICH ALLOWED THE LIQUID WASTE MATERIAL TO SLOSH OUT OF THE DRUMS AFTER CROSSING THE SPEED BUMPS.  THE AFFECTED AREAS OF THE PARKING LOT WERE DECONTAMINATED WITH A DECONTAMINATION SOLUTION.  THE REMAINDER OF THE SPILLED MATERIAL INSIDE THE TRUCK WAS ALSO ABSORBED WITH ABSORBENT MATERIALS AND THE FLOOR WAS DECONTAMINATED.  THE FOUR LEAKING DRUMS WERE PLACED IN UN APPROVED ""SALVAGE DRUMS""  AND SECURED IN THE TRUCK.

AFTER CALLING THE 800 NUMBER PROVIDED BY THE SHIPPER ON THE BILL OF LADING IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TRAILER SHOULD REMAIN AS IS UNTIL TERRA SAFETY MANAGER DALE UHL COULD COME E DOWN ON MONDAY A.M.  ON MONDAY, MR. UHL DECIDED TO CALL THE SIOUX CITY FIRE DEPT., SPILL TEAM TO THE SCENE, AFTER THEY UNLOADED THE TRAILER IN THE YARD DOWN TO THE POINT WHERE THE SHIPMENT BEGAN, THEY DETERMINED THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY HEAVY FREIGHT BEING LOADED ON TOP OF THE NUMBER 1 TOTE.  THE PRO-NUMBERS LOADED ON TOP OF THE TOTE WHERE 836-01205-2 AND 120-94149-4 TOTALING 445 LBS. AFTER REMOVING THE AFFECTED TOTE FROM THE TRAILER, THE TOTE WAS WRAPPED IN PLASTIC AND SET ON THE DOCK.

UHL WAS CALLED AND CAME BACK TO THE C.F. DOCK.  AFTER INSPECTION, HE CALLED THE LOCAL TERRA FACILITY AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ALL 3 TOTES WOULD BE TAKEN TO THEIR FACILITY TO BE DRAINED AND REPACKAGED.  MR. BOB PICKS WITH TERRA ALSO CAME TO THE C.F. DOCK THAT EVENING.  HE SAID THAT THESE TOTES SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN USED AS THEY HAD BEEN FILLED WITH A DIFFERENT PRODUCT PREVIOUSLY AND THAT THE TOTES WERE NOT IN GOOD SHAPE.  HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD SEEN AN INSTANCE WHERE AN OLD TOTE HAD ACTUALLY SPLIT IN HALF. THAT NEXT MORNING MR. PICK CAME TO THE C.F. DOCK AND ACCEPTED DELIVERY OF THE SHIPMENT. HE STATED AT THIS TIME THAT THE AGE OF ONE OF THE TOTES WAS OVER 10 YEARS, AND THAT THEY ALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAID THAT THE FACILITY THAT SHIPPED THESE TOTES WAS RECENTLY PURCHASED BY TERRA WAS NOT QUITE UP TO TERRA STANDARDS YET. THE FINAL ANALYSIS APPEARS TO BE THAT THE SPILL/LEAKAGE WAS A RESULT OF IMPROPER PACKAGING.  TWO OF THE TOTES WERE LEAKING ON THEIR OWN WHILE THE THIRD TOTE, EVEN THOUGH IT HAD TWO OTHERS SHIPMENTS OF FREIGHT ON TOP OF IT, MAY HAVE COMPRESSED DUE TO THE AGE OF THE TOTE RATHER THAT THE WEIGHT ON TOP OF THE TOTE.

THE FLAT CAR WITH THE CONTAINERS WAS BEING SET OUT AT THE BACK TRACK LOCATED WITHIN THE CITY OF BEAUMONT.  MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO BEAUMONT AND MET WITH JESSE PEREZ, MANAGER, COMPLIANCE MEASUREMENT, AND TRANSLOADING ENVIRONMENTAL, THE RAILROAD'S HAZARDOUS MATERIAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR.  DEVELOPED THE CONTAINERS INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT WERE ACTUALLY INTERMODAL TANKS ON CHASSIS, WHICH WERE LOADED ON A ARTICULATED FLAT CAR.  AS THE IM TANK WAS LEAKING PRODUCT FROM THE TOP AREA OF THE TANK AT A RATE OF 25-30 DROPS PER MINUTE, WHICH WAS POOLING ON THE FLAT CAR.  DUE TO THE EXTREMELY HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE AREA, THE PRODUCT WAS VOLATILIZING OFF BEFORE ANY REACHED THE GROUND.  INSPECTION OF THE TOP PORTION OF THE IM TANK DEVELOPED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAKING TO BE FROM THE SAFETY RELIEF VALVE.  THE SRV WAS SITUATED BEHIND THE MANWAY, ON THE LOW END OF THE TANK, AND DUE TO THE ANGLE OF THE TANK, THE PRODUCT LEVEL WAS AGAINST THE VALVE. A DRAIN LINE WAS ATTACHED TO THE TANK'S AIR LINE VALVE, AND DRAPED OVER THE SIDE OF THE TANK AND FLAT CAR, THEN INTO A 55 GALLON DRUM PLACED ADJACENT TO THE CAR.  THE AIR LINE VALVE WAS OPENED.  AS THERE WAS NO PRESSURE IN THE TANK, THIS ALLOWED THE PRODUCT TO GRAVITY FLOW INTO THE DRUM UNTIL THE LEVEL EQUALIZED.  THE DRAIN LINE WAS THEN ATTACHED TO A POGO PUMP, WITH THE TUBE PORTION OF THE PUMP EXTENDED THROUGH THE AIR LINE VALVE INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE TANK.  AFTER REMOVING A TOTAL OF 55 GALLONS FROM THE IM TANK, THE LEAK A THE SRV HAD CEASED, AND THE MANWAY WAS OPENED.  THE PRODUCT LEVEL WAS LOW ENOUGH AT THIS TIME POINT THAT IT WOULD ALLOW FOR REMOVAL OF THE SRV WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL LOSS OF PRODUCT.  THE SRV WAS REMOVED AND INSPECTED UPON FIELD COMPRESSING THE SEAT OF THE SRV, IT WAS NOTED THE GASKET AT THE SEAT APPEARED TO HAVE HEAVY GROOVES AND RE INSTALLED TO PROTECT THE LADING WHILE ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO LOCATE THE SHIPPER.  SINCE IT WAS A WEEKEND, ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THE SHIPPER AND CONSIGNEE OF  RECORD MET WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS.  ON MONDAY MORNING, CONTACT WAS MADE WITH GUSTAVO KOMEL, MILLER INTEMODAL, CHANNELVIEW, TEXAS, THE OWNER OF THE IM TANK, WHO ARRANGED TO OVERNIGHT A REPLACEMENT SRV.  UPON RECEIPT OF THE REPLACEMENT SRV THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE DEFECTIVE SRV WAS AGAIN REMOVED AND THE NEW SRV INSTALLED.  THE FLAT CAR WAS THEN RELEASED FOR MOVEMENT ONTO THE CONSIGNEE.   NOTIFICATIONS WERE MED TO CHEMTREC FOR REPORTING  PURPOSES AND ATTEMPTS TO LOCATE THE PRINCIPLE OWNER OF THIS SHIPMENT, ALONG WITH MILLER INTERMODAL, THE PRINCIPLE OWNER OF THE IM TANK.  DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCT, AND THE MINIMAL AMOUNT RELEASED, WHICH DID NOT MEET THE REPORTABLE QUANTITY, NO FURTHER NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE.

MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE COLTON RECEIVING YARD, LOCATED THE TANK CAR IN YARD TRACK 1153 AND OBSERVED THE TANK CAR LEAKING A STEADY STREAM OF PRODUCT FROM THE CENTER BOTTOM PORTION OF THE CAR, ESTIMATED TO BE 8-10 GALLONS PER HOUR.  BILLING INFORMATION OF THIS CAR SHOWED THE CONTENTS TO BE A RESIDUE, AND NOT A FULLY LOADED CAR. THE LEAK APPEARED TO BE AT THE WELD THAT ATTACHES THE PROTECTIVE SKID PLATE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK CAR.  THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS NOTIFIED, DUE TO THE TOXIC NATURE OF THE PRODUCT VAPORS.  ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH ECOLOGY CONTROL, UNION PACIFIC'S HAZARDOUS MATERIAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR, TO RESPOND A TEAM AND EQUIPMENT TO ASSIST IN THE REMEDIATION.  DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE TANK CAR IN THE RECEIVING YARD, ACCESS WAS LIMITED, WHICH REQUIRED MOVING THE TANK CAR.  AS THERE WAS A HOSPITAL DIRECTLY NORTH OF THE RECEIVING YARD, IT WAS DETERMINED THE TANK CAR WOULD HAVE TO BE MOVED EAST, WHICH WOULD PLACE THE CAR ADJACENT TO THE MAIN SWITCHING YARD.  THE HIGHWAY PATROL CLOSED INTERSTATE 10 AND THE CEDER AVE., OVERPASS WHILE THE CAR WAS BEING MOVED, WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY 6AM.  THE AREA WHERE THE TANK CAR WAS TO BE SET, WHICH INCLUDED THE REPAIR SHOP, WAS EVACUATED, AND ONCE THE TANK CAR WAS SET TO YARD TRACK 905 AND ENTRY TEAM REMOVED THE VALVING FROM THE PRODUCT LIQUID LINE ON THE TOP OF THE CAR, AND PLACED A CONTAINMENT SYSTEM TO CAPTURE THE LEAKING PRODUCT UNDERNEATH THE CAR. DURING THIS PROCESS, THE LEAK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR STOPPED AND RESTARTED SEVERAL TIMES.  A VACUUM TRUCK WAS BROUGHT IN AND SET UP WITH A PVC ""STINGER"" TO ACCESS ANY FREE PRODUCT THROUGH THE TANK CAR'S LIQUID LINE.   NO PRODUCT WAS OBTAINED DURING THIS PROCESS, WHICH FURTHER CONFIRMED THE TANK CAR LINER HAD FAILED, AND IT APPEARED THAT THE LIQUID WAS BETWEEN THE TANK LINER AND THE TANK SHELL.  SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO PUTTY THE WELD AT THE SIDE PLATE, WHICH ONLY RESULTED IN THE LEAK MOVING TO OTHER AREAS OF THE WELD.  AT THIS POINT, ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH LOCAL GATX TANK CAR REPAIR SHOP TO RECEIVE THIS CAR.  THE REPAIR SHOP HAS A CONTAINMENT PIT THAT WOULD ACCOMMODATE THE LEAKING TANK UNTIL IT COULD BE PURGED.  A MAKESHIFT CONTAINMENT SYSTEM WAS CONSTRUCTED UNDER THE TANK CAR TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER SPREADING OF PRODUCT DURING THE MOVE.  THE TANK CAR WAS THEN MOVED AS A SINGLE UNIT WITH A YARD SWITCH ENGINE, AND SET TO THE GATX CONTAINMENT AREA BY 11 PM. TWO 55 GALLON DRUMS OF FREE PRODUCT WERE CAPTURED DURING THIS EVENT, AND WERE DELIVERED TO THE DOW TERMINAL ISLAND FACILITY, PER THEIR INSTRUCTIONS.
