THE CREW CONTINUED WITH THE TRAIN TO A NON-POPULATED AREA AT PORT CHICAGO, BNSF MILE POST 1163.4, TO MAKE AN INSPECTION.  LOCAL AUTHORITIES ASSISTED BNSF PERSONEL WITH AN ASSESSMENT. THE LEAD FLAT CAR WAS TRANSPORTING CONTAINER NOSU 442707 WHICH CONTAINED 76 DRUMS OF ETHYL MERCAPTAN, A PUNGENT ODORIZER MOST COMMONLY USED IN NATURAL GAS.  UPON INSPECTION OF THIS CONTAINER, NO PRODUCT WAS FOUND TO BE LEAKING THROUGH TO THE EXTERIOR OF THE CONTAINER.  THE CONTRA COSTA FIRE DEPT RELEASED THE TRAIN TO CONTINUE THE 25 MILES TO ITS DESTINATION WHERE THE CONTAINER COULD BE SAFELY LIFTED OUT OF THE WELL IN THE FLAT CAR AND FURTHER ASSESSED IN A PAVED AND LIGHTED AREA. ********************** THE CONTAINER WAS DERAMPED AND PLACED IN THE HAZ MAT CONTAINMENT PIT AT THE RICHMOND INTERMODAL FACILITY.  ONCE AT THE PIT, INSPECTION REVEALED NO EXTERNAL SIGNS OF LEAKAGE, BUT THE FOUL STENCH WAS STILL PRESENT.  THE SHIPPER REQUESTED THAT THEIR CONTRACTOR HANDLE THE LOAD AND REMEDIATION. IN ADDITION, THE BENEFICIAL OWNER DISPATCHED A TEAM TO ASSIST WITH THE RESOLUTION EFFORTS.  IN THE INTERIM, THE RICHMOND FIRE DEPT AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY HEALTH DEPT ARRIVED AT THE PIT TO REVIEW PROGRESS AND PROVIDE INPUT TO THE RESOLUTION PLAN BEING DEVELOPED.  DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT RELEASING ADDITIONAL ODOR, THE CONTAINER WAS NOT PERMITTED TO BE OPENED TO ASSESS THE CONDITION OF THE LOAD.  READINGS TAKEN ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTAINER WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR FOUND LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE THE LOWER EXPLOSIVE LIMIT (LEL) FOR THE PRODUCT. FOLLOWING A JOINT MEETING ON 2/5, THE CONTAINER WAS TAKEN FROM THE RAMP TO A REMOTE SITE FOR OPENING AND ASSESSMENT.  SEVERAL METHODS WERE ATTEMPTED TO CONTROL THE ODOR AND REDUCE THE VAPORS. **************************************** ENTRY WAS PERMITTED ON 2/6.  OVERALL, THE LOAD WAS IN GOOD CONDITION AND BLOCKING AND BRACING WAS SECURE.  ONE DRUM IN THE SECOND ROW FROM THE NOSE OF THE CONTAINER WAS FOUND TO HAVE A THREE INCH LONG HAIRLINE CRACK IN THE BOTTOM CHIME.  THE DRUM HAD BEEN ROTATING WHILE IN TRANSIT AND HAD WORN THE BOTTOM CHIME FLAT (FOR ABOUT A ONE-HALF INCH WIDE BY TWENTY-EIGHT INCH LONG LENGTH OF THE DRUM'S CIRCUMFERENCE) ON THE STEEL 'TUNNEL' PLATE IN THE CONTAINER FLOOR.  THIS PLATE ADDS REINFORCEMENT TO THE CONTAINER IN THE REGION WHERE A HITCH WOULD BE ON A TRAILER.  A SHIM BETWEEN THE PLATE AND DRUMS IS NOT USUALLY NECESSARY.  MOST OF THE 16 DRUMS IN THE FIRST FOUR STACKS HAD MARKS INDICATING ROTATION, THOUGH.  ALL DRUMS WERE CLEANED AND RELOADED INTO ANOTHER CONTAINER FOR EXPORT.  THE CULPRIT DRUM WAS RETURNED TO THE SHIPPING FACILITY AT THE SHIPPER'S REQUEST.  RESULTS OF THE FLAT CAR'S RIDE QUALITY HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY EVALUATED.  ************** ITEM 23E PROVIDES TRAIN DELAY COST FOR SEVEN TRAINS DELAYED FOR THE INITIAL INSPECTION AT PORT CHICAGO.

THE FERRIC CHLORIDE CONTAINED IN THE TRAILER LEAKED OUT AND RAN OFF OF THE ROADWAY INTO A DITCH OF THE WESTBOUND SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. THE HIGHWAY WAS CLOSED DUE TO THE ACCIDENT FROM 0800 TO 1830 HOURS.  THE DRIVER RECEIVED BROKEN RIBS, A COLLAPSED LUNG AND FACIAL CUTS IN THE ACCIDENT.  HE WAS REMOVED FROM THE TRUCK AND TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BY AMBULANCE.  THE PRODUCT IN THE DITCH WAS RECOVERED BY PUMPING IT INTO ANOTHER TRUCK BROUGHT TO THE SCENE, THEN THE TRUCK AND TRAILER WERE RIGHTED AND TOWED TO THE IMPOUND YARD OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL IN BARSTOW CALIFORNIA.
