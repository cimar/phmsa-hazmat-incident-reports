AT APPROXIMATELY 1430 HOURS ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2002, THE DRIVER OF A SOUTHEASTERN LNG TRUCKING TANKER TRANSPORTING LNG FROM ATLANTA GAS LIGHT COMPANY'S RIVERDALE PLANT TO CHATTANOOGA GAS COMPANY'S LNG PLANT NOTICED THE VEHICLE BEHIND HIM FLASHING HIS LIGHTS.  WHILE FOLLOWING THE TANKER, THE DRIVER HAD NOTICED THAT THE BACK DOORS AT THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE HAD FROSTED OVER AND A SLIGHT CLOUD WAS COMING FROM THE DOORS.  THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE FOLLOWING HAD DIALED 911 ON HIS CELL PHONE.  AS THE TANKER DRIVER PULLED OVER, HE REALIZED THAT, MORE THAN LIKELY, THE VALVE LOCATED INSIDE THE DOORS HAD VIBRATED SUCH TO CAUSE IT TO OPEN SLIGHTLY.  ONCE STOPPED, HE PREPARED TO OPEN THE DOORS AND CLOSE THE VALVE.  AT THAT TIME, THE POLICE ARRIVED ON SCENE AND TOLD HIM TO GET AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE.  THE POLICE NOTIFIED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAZMAT UNIT, CLOSED THE 3500 BLOCK OF AMNICOLA HIGHWAY, AND BEGAN EVACUATING APPROXIMATELY 250 PEOPLE (ACCORDING TO NEWSPAPER REPORTS).  WHEN HAZMAT ARRIVED, CHIEF NICHOLS NOTIFIED CHRIS YOUNG, SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CHATTANOOGA LNG PLANT.  MR. YOUNG, UPON ARRIVAL, DISCUSSED A PLAN TO CLOSE THE APPARENTLY OPEN VALVE WITH CHIEF NICHOLS.  AFTER BEING OUTFITTED IN PROTECTIVE GEAR, MR. YOUNG, ACCOMPANIED BY TWO FIRE FIGHTERS, CLOSED THE VALVE.  THE TANKER THEN RESUMED ITS ROUTE TO THE CHATTANOOGA LNG PLANT WHILE THE ROAD WAS RE-OPENED.  ROAD CLOSURE IS ESTIMATED AT ONE HOUR.  ONCE AT THE PLANT, 8286 GALLONS OF LNG, AN APPROXIMATE FULL LOAD WAS OFF-LOADED. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT NO MORE THAN 5 GALLONS LEAKED FROM THE OPEN VALVE.
