ON WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1999 OUR DRIVER WAS IN THE PROCESS OF FILLING THE 4000 GAL TANK AT BBS LOBSTER CO. WHEN THE POCKET HE WAS PUMPING FROM RAN DRY. HE LEFT THE NOZZLE IN THE TANK AND WENT BACK TO THE TRUCK TO OPEN ANOTHER TANK POCKET. WHEN HE RETURNED, HE REALIZED THE TANK WAS OVERFILLING. HE SHUT THE NOZZLE OFF AND WENT TO THE TRUCK TO GET SOME ABSORBENT PADS TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL. HE USED WHAT PADS HE HAD TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL AND THEN RETURNED TO THE  OFFICE TO GET MORE PADS. HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT THE CONTAINMENT DRAIN VALVE WAS OPEN. WHILE HE WAS AT THE OFFICE, WE RECEIVED A CALL FROM BBS LOBSTER SAYING THAT OIL WAS SPILLING INTO THE WATER. WE IMMEDIATELY SENT SEVERAL PEOPLE DOWN WITH SEVERAL BUNDLES OF ABSORBENT PADS AND OIL BOOMS. WORKING WITH BBS PERSONNEL, WE BOOMED OFF THE AREA NEAR THE POUND AND BEGAN SOAKING UP THE OIL. IT WAS A COOL, WINDY DRY DAY WITH A WIND SPEED OF 15-20 MPH BLOWING OUT OF THE NORTHWEST. THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND WAS SUCH THAT IT CONTAINED MOST TO THE OIL IN A SMALL COVE NEXT TO THE POUND. A SMALL AMOUNT OF OIL WAS CARRIED OUT TO SEA BY THE TIDE. IT IS UNCERTAIN HOW MUCH OIL WAS CARRIED OUT TO SEA AND HOW MUCH REMAINED IN THE COVE. THE TOTAL SPILL WAS ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN 50-75 GALLONS. I NOTIFIED THE EPA OFFICE IN BANGOR, MAINE ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND THEY ADVISED ME TO CALL THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. I NOTIFIED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WHILE AT THE SITE AND FILLED OUT A REPORT OVER THE PHONE. THEY INDICATED THAT NO OTHER REPORT WOULD BE NECESSARY, AND THAT THEY WOULD NOTIFY THE COAST GUARD. THE COAST GUARD REPRESENTATIVES ARRIVED AT THE SITE THAT AFTERNOON. BY THE TIME THEY ARRIVED THE SPILL HAD  BEEN COMPLETELY CLEANED UP. THEY DID AN INSPECTION OF THE AREA AND WERE SATISFIED THAT WE HAD DONE A THOROUGH JOB OF CLEANING UP THE SPILL.THEY INDICATED THAT SOMEONE FROM THEIR INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT WOULD VISIT US TO DISCUSS THE INCIDENT AND FILL OUT A REPORT. APPARENTLY THE CONTAINMENT VALVE HAD BEEN RECENTLY REMOVED DURING CONSTRUCTION OF AN ENCLOSURE AROUND THE STORAGE TANK TO ALLOW WATER TO DRAIN OUT.

BRENNER OIL COMPANY WAS MAKING A ROUTINE DELIVERY OF HEATING OIL TO THE RESIDENCE OF MATT BORDEAUX.  THE HOMEOWNERS WERE NOT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF FUEL DELIVERY.  THE HOME HAS TWO HEATING OIL TANKS - ONE OUTSIDE OF THE RESIDENCE (UNDERGROUND),  WHILE THE OTHER TANK IS LOCATED IN THE BASEMENT.  ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE, THE HOMEOWNER MARKED WHICH TANK SHOULD BE FILLED.  HOWEVER, THE HOMEOWNER MARKED THE WRONG FILL PORT FOR DELIVERY, RESULTING IN FUEL OIL BEING DELIVERED TO THE TANK IN THE BASEMENT, WHICH WAS ALREADY PARTIALLY FULL AND HAD A LOOSE BUNG AT THE TOP.  LESS THAN 150 GALLONS WAS SPILLED FROM THE HEATING OIL TANK INTO THE BASEMENT.  MOST OF THE FUEL OIL WAS CONTAINED IN THE BASEMENT.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF FUEL OIL (ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 25 GALLONS) FLOWED INTO THE BASEMENT'S SUMP PUMP, AT WHICH TIME IT WAS PUMPED OUTSIDE ONTO THE HOMEOWNER'S CONCRETE DRIVE.  AS SOON AS BRENNER WAS NOTIFIED BY THE HOMEOWNERS OF THIS PROBLEM, A SPILL RESPONSE COMPANY AND AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SITE.  THE SPILL RESPONSE TEAM PLACED ABSORBENT BOOMS AND OIL DRY IN THE BASEMENT AND ON THE CONCRETE DRIVE AND PROCEEDED WITH CLEANING UP THE RESULTANT DEBRIS INTO 55 GALLON DRUMS.  AFTER THE DEBRIS WAS REMOVED, THE BASEMENT AND CONCRETE DRIVE WERE WASHED AND SCRUBBED WITH A HIGH PRESSURE HOT WATER JET, WITH THE WASH LIQUIDS CAPTURED BY A VACUUM TRUCK.  SEVERAL INCHES OF TOPSOIL WERE REMOVED IN THE AREA WHERE FUEL OIL PONDED NEXT TO THE CONCRETE DRIVE.
