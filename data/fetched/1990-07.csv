WAS CONTRACTED BY GENERAL ELECTRIC SERVICE CENTER LOCATED AT 156 CIRCLE FREEWAY DRIVE, CINCINNATI, OHIO TO FURNISH A TANKER AND ONE DRIVER TO ASSIST IN THE REMOVAL OF PCB OIL FROM A TRANSFORMER AND TRANSPORT THE PRODUCT TO THE GENERAL ELECTRIC SERVICE CENTER IN CINCINNATI, OHIO.  THE TRANSFORMER WAS LOCATED AT THE TIMET CORPORATION, 100 TITANIUM WAY, TORONTO, OHIO. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, PCB OIL WAS BEING PUMPED FROM A BELOW GROUND LEVEL TRANSFORMER INTO THE TANKER, WHICH WAS PARKED ON THE FLOOR ABOVE. SEE ATTACHED DIAGRAMS 1 AND 3.  THE MATERIAL WAS BEING PUMPED WITH A PACER CENTRIFUGAL PUMP WITH A 20 FOOT SECTION OF HOSE FROM THE TRANSFORMER TO THE PUMP AND A 40 FOOT SECTION OF HOSE FROM THE PUMP TO THE TANKER. DURING THE PUMPING PROCESS, OIL WAS FOUND TO BE SEEPING FROM AROUND THE PUMP'S FILLER PLUG (SEE PUMP SPECIFICATION SHEET ATTACHED).  TONAWANDA TANK TRANSPORT SERVICE, INC. PERSONNEL SHUT THE PUMP OFF, CLOSED THE VALVE AT THE TRANSFORMER AND TIGHTENED THE FILLER PLUG.  THE TOP OF THE FILLER PLUG BROKE OFF (SEE ATTACHED DIAGRAM 3) ALLOWING PCB OIL TO ESCAPE INTO THE VAULT AREA.  AN ESTIMATED VOLUME OF 10 GALLONS WAS RELEASED AND THREE OPERATORS WERE SPRAYED WITH MATERIAL. PERSONNEL AND THE AFFECTED AREAS WERE CLEANED UP IMMEDIATELY.  ALL SURFACE AREAS WERE WASHED DOWN TWICE BY GENERAL ELECTRIC PERSONNEL USING POWER CLEANER 155.  ALL CLEANING MATERIALS AND CONTAMINATED CLOTHING WAS PLACED IN 55 GALLON DRUMS FOR DISPOSAL BY GENERAL ELECTRIC. THE PERSONNEL SPRAYED WITH OIL EXPERIENCED SLIGHT SKIN IRRITATIONS. SHOWERS WITH SOAP AND WATER ELIMINATED THIS EFFECT AND NO ONE HAS REQUIRED ANY MEDICAL ATTENTION OR TREATMENT. THIS INCIDENT WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF THE FAILURE OF THE PUMP DRAIN PLUG. IT IS UNDETERMINED IF THE FAILURE WAS THE RESULT OF AN INHERENT PRODUCT DEFECT OR STRESS FROM REGULAR USE.  REGULAR PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE IS PERFORMED ON THE PUMP AND A PRE-ASSIGNMENT INSPECTION PRIOR TO USE ON JULY 9, 1990 REVEALED NO MECHANICAL PROBLEMS. WE HAVE AUTHORIZED SOME ADDITIONAL CLEANING OF THE CONTAMINATED AREA AND, PENDING THE RESULTS OF THE TESTS TO BE CONDUCTED THIS WEEK, EXPECT TO DECLARE THE SITE CLEARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 40 CFR, PART 761 PCB SPILL CLEANUP POLICY. FINALLY, WE ARE WORKING IN CONCERT WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC SERVICE CENTER PERSONNEL AND OUR OWN CONSULTING FIRM TO ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES TO LIMIT THE POSSIBILITY OF FUTURE PROBLEMS. WE HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED REVISED STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES WHICH WILL 1) PROVIDE FOR AMPLE PLASTIC SHEETING TO COVER THE ENTIRE AREA OF POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION DURING PUMPING OPERATIONS, 2) MANDATE THAT ALL HOSES BE DRAINED PRIOR TO THE REPAIR OR ADJUSTMENT OF PUMPS, HOSES, ETC. DURING PUMPING OPERATIONS, AND WE ARE INVESTIGATING EQUIPMENT CHANGES TO REDUCE THE RISKS OF MECHANICAL FAILURE.",,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10000,,US,

THE GROUND CREW APPLIED SAWDUST TO THE SPILL AND THE PLANE WAS FLOWN BACK TO MIA AIRPORT WHERE THE ACID SOLUTION SPILLED WAS NEUTRALIZED BY OHM CORP.  THE PLANE WAS DISASSEMBLED TO THE AIRFRAME IN THE CARGO SECTION TO INSURE THROUGH CLEANING AND FACILITATE INSPECTION FOR ANY POSSIBLE CORROSION.  THE PLANE WAS INSPECTED BY THE FAA APPROVED REPAIR STATION NARCAM IN MIAMI AND THE FAA LOCAL INSPECTOR AFTER CLEANING AND WAS RELEASED FOR USE.  THE HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATED IN THIS OPERATION WAS DISPOSED OF IN AN APPROVED EPA ROUTE BY THE OHM CORP. PACKAGING USED FOR THE SHIPMENT WAS DOT APPROVED SPEC 34 DRUMS PALLETIZED 36 TO A PALLET AND STRETCH WRAPPED, THE PALLET PATTERN USED IS 4X3 STACKED 3 HIGH ON A PALLET.  THE AIRLINE LOADS 4 PALLETS, SINGLE PALLET HIGH ON A UNITIZED LOAD DEVICE AND NETS THEM FOR SAFE TRANSIT.  THE CAUSE OF THE LEAKAGE WAS PUNCTURES TO THE LOWER LIP AREA OF THE DRUMS.  THE THREE DRUMS WERE PUNCTURED BY THE CARDO NET ANCHOR CLIPS SOMETIME DURING THE FLIGHT. THE PALLETIZED LOAD MUST HAVE SHIFTED SIGNIFICANTLY IN TRANSIT AS THE DRUMS NEEDED TO LEAVE THE PALLET TO BE PUNCTURED BY THE ANCHORS. PALLETIZED LOADS THAT ARE LOADED 4 PALLETS TO A UNITIZED LOAD DEVICE AND ARE RESTRAINED WITH A NET USUALLY DO NOT SHIFT IN THIS MANNER.  WE WILL REVIEW THE USE OF ADDITIONAL STRETCH WRAP ON THE PALLETS AND PROVIDE A PROTECTIVE CARDBOARD SHEET FOR THE BOTTOM.  THIS WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION AGAINST PUNCTURES AND LOAD SHIFTS.  OUR PLANT PERSONNEL IN ARGENTINA VISITED THE AIRPORT A DAY LATER AND SAID THAT AT THE AIRPORT THE FREIGHT WAS NO LONGER PALLETIZED AND STRETCH WRAPPED AND ONLY ONE PALLET WAS PRESENT.  THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE WHY THIS WAS SO.  THE CARRIER SAID THE FREIGHT WAS MOVED AS IT WAS GIVEN TO THEM BY PEPSI, SO WE HAVE REPORTED THE INCIDENT AS PACKED THAT WAY. ADDENDUM: WHILE THIS IS THE SAME SHIPMENT OF DRUMS THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE MIAMI SPILL ON 7/6/90 THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THAT INCIDENT WAS NOT THE SAME AS FOUND WITH THE PUNCTURED DRUMS.  THE ENTIRE SHIPMENT WAS INSPECTED AFTER ARRIVAL TO OUR PLANT IN ARGENTINA AND THE FOLLOWING WAS FOUND:  SOME IMPACT DAMAGE TO SOME CONTAINERS AND SMALL CRACKS IN THE HANDLE AREA OF 4 DRUMS.  SINCE THIS WAS ALL TOP SURFACE DAMAGE IT RESULTED IN NO SPILLAGE. (IT IS SIMILAR TO THE DAMAGE SEEN IN MIAMI, LAB TESTING SHOWS THE HANDLES CRACK AT 10 TO 12 FT DROP HEIGHT).  WHILE IN OUR OPINION SOME POOR JUDGEMENT WAS USED REGARDING THE CHOICE MADE ON THE REMAINING 37 DRUMS SUITABILITY FOR SHIPMENT AFTER THE MIAMI FALL, THE LEAKERS SHOW NO SIMILAR DAMAGE AND WERE PROBABLY NOT PUNCTURED BEFORE LOADING.  WE HAVE NO WAY TO DETERMINE IF THE LEAKERS CAME FROM THE GROUP OF PAILS THAT WERE DROPPED IN MIAMI OR NOT,  BUT THE PUNCTURES ARE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT FAILURE MODE THAN THE RUPTURES IN MIAMI, AND IF PUNCTURED IN MIAMI THEY WOULD HAVE EMPTIED BEFORED RELOADING.",,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Reusable molded polyethylene container without overpack RHNA*,34,No,,,,ZZ,,,387,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,36225,,US,

AFTER COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP, HE STARTED TO PULL TRUCK TO THE NORTH.  THIS VEHICLE PROCEED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AT SPEED CAUSING MR BRANAM TO APPLY HIS BRAKES SUDDENLY.  MR BRANAM PULLED INTO AN ABANDONED TRUCK STOP THAT SETS ON THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE INTERSECTION TO IONSPECT THE LOAD.  UPON INSPECTION, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT UPON BRAKE APPLICATION, A TRANSFORMER NEAR THE REAR OF THE TRAILER SHIFTED ABOUT 6-10"" FORWARD.  A TIE DOWN CHAIN THAT HAD BEEN PLACED BETWEEN TOW CEREMIC BUSHINGS CAUSED ONE OF THESE BUSHINGS TO BREAK WHEN IT CAME INTO CONTACT/STRUCK THE CHAIN. ASKAREL WAS FLOWING OUT OF THE BROKEN BUSHING INTO THE CONTAINMENT PLAN. A SMALL AMOUNT OF ASKAREL WAS ALSO DRIPPING ONTO A PIECE FO WOOD USED TO BLOCK AND BRACE, FLOWING TO THE END ON THE WOOD AND ONTO THE GROUND.  LESS THAN 1 PINT WAS RELEASED ONTO THE GROUND.  MR BRANAM PUT HIS PROTECTIVE CLOTHING ON AND PROCEEDED TO WIPE THE WOOD WITH PAPER TOWELS TO KEEP THE MATERIAL FROM DRIPPING ONTO THE GROUND.  THE TRAILER PAN HAD A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF WATER IN IT CAUSED BY RUNNING THROUGH A RAIN.  THE OIL RUNNING OUT OF THE TRANSFORMER WAS FLOATING ON THIS WATER.  MR BRANAM RELEASED AIR FROM HIS TRACTOR AIR BAGS TO ALLOW THE TRAILER TO REST LOWER IN THE FRONT. THIS BROUGHT ALL LIQUID MATERIAL TO THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER AND PREVENTED ANY FROM POSSIBLE LEAKING OUT THE TAILGATE ON THE PAN.  ALL DEBRIS DRUMS WERE FULL WHICH PREVENTED MR.
