VERTEX PROCEDURES/INVESTIGATION: VERTEX HAS A RAIL CAR PROCEDURE/ CHECKLIST FOR RELEASING CARS TO THE RAILROAD (RR). THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURE IS FOLLOWED BY THE OPERATORS WHEN UNHOOKING/RELEASING A CAR TO THE RR. ALL PRODUCT VALVE ARE UNBOLTED AND REMOVED FROM THE CAR. BLIND FLANGES WITH GASKETS ARE THEN ON THE CAR. IN THE CASE OF AN HCI CAR, VAPORS COME OUT OF THE CAR UNTIL THE BLIND FLANGE IS TIGHTENED DOWN, DUE TO THE VAPOR PRESSURE OF THE PRODUCT. TYPICALLY, THE CAR VENT WHEN THE PRODUCT VALVES ARE UNHOOKED. THE BLIND FLANGES ARE TIGHTENED IMMEDIATELY TO STOP THE CAR FROM VENTING OFF AFTER UNHOOKING THE UNLOADING VALVES. IT IS OBVIOUS WHEN THE BLIND FLANGES ARE NOT TIGHT, BECAUSE VAPORS ARE VISIBLE. BEFORE THE OPERATORS LEAVES THE TOP OF THE CAR ALL BLIND FLANGES ARE CHECKED FOR TIGHTNESS. THE AIR VALVE ON THE CAR IS VERIFIED TO BE OFF AND DOME BOLTS ARE VERIFIED TO BE TIGHT IF THE PRODUCER REQUESTS IT SEALS ARE APPLIED TO THE CAR. TIMELINE/WEATHER: THIS RAIL CAR WAS CLOSED UP ON 1/27/03, RELEASED TO THE UNION PACIFIC RR ON 1/29/03. THE HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE AREA THOSE THREE DAYS WERE 50- 58F. THE CAR WAS NOT PULLED FROM THE DUPO AREA UNTIL 2/6/03. ON 2/2/03, THE TEMPERATURE ROSE TO 67F, AND ON 2/3 IT WAS STILL 64F, HIGH AND RAIN, HIGH HUMIDITY. HAD THIS CAR HAD A LOOSE FLANGE DURING THAT PERIOD, VENTING WOULD HAVE BEEN VISIBLE. CONCLUSION: IN VERTEX OPINION, THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS A LOOSE FLANGE ON THE RAIL CAR. IT APPEARS MOST LIKELY THAT SOMEONE VANDALIZED OR TAMPERED WITH THE CAR DURING TRANSIT. FROM 1/29/03 TO 2/14/03 THE RAIL CAR WAS NO LONGER IN VERTEX CAR. VERTEX IS NOT AWARE OF ANY MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION WHICH RESULTED IN THIS LOOSE FLANGE.",,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

RUTLEDGE,OPERATIONS MANAGER,,,,,,"AT APPROXIMATELY 7:10 THIS MORNING, KEVIN DUNN WAS OFFLOADING OFF-ROAD DIESEL AT LEHIGH CEMENT IN LEEDS, ALABAMA INTO A LOCOMOTIVE FUEL TANK WHEN HE NOTICED THAT THE PUMP HAD LOST PRESSURE.  HE IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE PUMP AND WENT TO INVESTIGATE.  HE DISCOVERED A PUDDLE OF FUEL UNDER THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF HIS TRUCK.  HE REMOVED BAGS OF SORBENT MATERIAL FROM HIS TRUCK AND STARTED BUILDING A DAM TO STOP THE FUEL FROM REACHING A DRAINAGE GRATE, WHICH RAN THE LENGTH OF THE AREA WHERE HE WAS PARKED.  HIS QUICK ACTIONS KEPT ALL BUT A VERY SMALL AMOUNT (ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 5 GALLONS) FROM ENTERING THE DRAIN.  KEVIN CALLED BILLY PUCKETT WHO THEN CALLED ME.  I GOT THERE JUST AFTER TWO TRUSSVILLE WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES WHO BILLY HAD DISPATCHED WITH MORE OIL DRY MATERIAL.  WE ALL IMMEDIATELY STARTED SPREADING THE MATERIAL.  WHEN IT APPEARED THAT THE SPILL AREA WAS UNDER CONTROL, I STARTED TRACKING THE DRAIN AND DISCOVERED WHERE IT DISCHARGED TO DRY CREEK, WHICH FLOWS PAST THE PLANT.  DIESEL HAD REACHED THE CREEK AND CREATED AN OBVIOUS SHEEN.  DRY CREEK DISCHARGES TO THE LITTLE CAHABA, WHICH FLOWS DIRECTLY INTO LAKE PURDY.  I NOTIFIED JOEL YEAGER, LEHIGH'S PLANT ENGINEER AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO HIM.  I ALSO BORROWED SOME ABSORBENT 'SOCKS' FORM HIM TO PLACE IN THE CREEK IMMEDIATELY WHILE WE WAITED FOR SOME TO BE DELIVERED FORM TRUSSVILLE.  WE PLACED THE SOCKS A THE OUTFALL AND THEN PLACED THREE BOOMS ACROSS THE CREEK OF TIED TOGETHER SOCKS TO TRAP ANY FUEL THAT GOT TO THE CREEK.  AFTER THE SITUATION WAS SECURE I NOTIFIED ADEM AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC).  THE NRC TOOK A REPORT OVER THE PHONE AND ADEM SENT PAUL ROGERS FROM THE BIRMINGHAM OFFICE. PAUL WAS SATISFIED THAT WE HAD MANAGED THE SPILL TO ADEM'S SATISFACTION AND SUGGESTED THAT WE LEAVE THE BOOMS AND PADS IN PLACE UNTIL AFTER THE NEST RAINFALL EVENT, RAIN IS PREDICTED FOR THURSDAY OF THIS WEEK.  ALL OF THE FUEL UNDER THE TRUCK WAS PICKED UP BY THE OIL DRY AND WAS SHOVELED INTO DRUMS AND DELIVERED TO TRUSSVILLE FOR DISPOSAL.  THIS MATERIAL CAN GO INTO THE DUMPSTER.  LEHIGH'S ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER WAS SICK BUT I TALKED TO HIM BY PHONE AND HE WAS SATISFIED AS WAS JOEL YEAGER.  CLOSE INSPECTION OF THE TRUCK REVEALED THAT A RUBBER HOSE UNDER THE TRUCK (TRUCK# 2308) HAD BEEN RUBBING AGAINST THE DRIVESHAFT OF THE TRUCK AND HAD WORN A HOLE IN THE HOSE.  RE-ROUTING OF THE HOSE OR BETTER RESTRAINT OF THE HOSE ON THIS AND OTHER TRUCKS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY UPGRADED SHOULD BE DONE IMMEDIATELY TO PREVENT ANOTHER INCIDENT LIKE THIS.  ONLY APPROXIMATELY 20 TO 50 GALLONS OF FUEL WAS LOST.
