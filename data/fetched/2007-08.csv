Vehicle lost approximately 4000 gallons of diesel fuel and caught fire resulting in the death of the driver.  Haz mat team was immediatly called in by Flying J safety department, at which time HMHTTC Response Inc's Chicago office mobilized to the site with 4 responders, 1 vac truck and a frac tank. Sand birms were initially installed to prevent migration of the spill. Vac work started and continued until 1724 hrs on 8/3/2007 with 5,000 gallons of fuel/water recovered, 2,000 gallons of which was diesel fuel. On 8/8/07, HMHTTC crew of 5 with excavator, skid steer and 3 dump trucks returned to site for excavation. Over time frame of 8/8 to 8/10/07, 464 tons of contaminated soil were excavated from area of 200'L X 5-13'W X 5-8'D on the side of the road. 547 tons of backfill were used to restore excavation site. At the request of IEPA, 19 soil samples were also taken during this time and delivered to a certified lab for testing for BTEX and PNA's along with a VOC of nearby well water. Liquid/solids from frac tank and excavation were properly disposed of. HMHTTC crew also powerwashed a small amount of smoke residue from the siding of a nearby house at 1749 E. State Highway 33, Wheeler IL 62479 and replaced 4 cherry trees that were destroyed in the accident. As of 1200 hrs 8/10/07, excavation and restoration of site has been completed.","At this time, still awaiting accident reconstruction report to make recommendations.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,238374,Flying J Transportation LLC,US,

An employee was attempting to push the IBC to back of the trailer by placing another IBC in front of it and pushing it with a forklift that was on the ground.  We believe the pressure of being pushed is what caused the IBC to crack.  Material in the IBC was a Waste Corrosive Liquid Spent Acids carrying the following EPA Waste Codes, D002, D006, D007, D008, and D011.  After the rupture occured the drum was then tilted to stop the flow of liquid.  Approximately 60 (sixty) gallons of material was spilled in the trailer and onto the ground.  Absorbent was immediately put down and the spill contained to the property.  Cleanup consisted of using absorbent to stabalize free liquids and a neutrilizer was used to wash down the trailer and pavement.  The cleanup effort created 2 (two) cubic yard boxes of debris.  The remaining material in the tote was transfered into 3 (three) 55-gallon poly UN rated drums.",It is against company policy to use a tote to push another tote.  Employees are provided a pallet jack to use to move drums to the back of a trailer.  Due to the space it is impossible to get a forklift into a trailer to move containers.  Both employees involved were given a verbal warning as it was the first incident for each employee.  All employees have be retrained on proper loading procedures.

Upon opening a transport unit, an employee noticed a small amount of liquid material on a van trailer floor.  He immediately notified his supervisor of the spill and an in house emergency response crew was dispatched to identify the source of release and to take all necessary corrective actions.  Upon review of the paperwork, the emergency response crew donned appropriate protective equipment and entered the trailer.  An inspection of the non-bulk packages in the trailer identified that a single 5-gallon UN 1H1 container of Class 3 liquid material has developed a pin-hole near the top half of the container and began to seep out.  The response crew immediately used a chemically compatible absorbent material to contain approximately 1 gallons of liquid that was release to the floor of the trailer.   The leaking drum was placed in a suitable salvage drum and all of the absorbent was collected and placed into appropriate container for disposal at an approved hazardous waste management facility.  All of the released material was contained in the van trailer and no offsite impact occurred.",  Our investigation determined that the cause of the incident was deterioration of the container on storage and insufficient inspection prior to transportation.,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc",US,

A new Buna 20 inch gasket was installed and the manway cover was properly secured. All spillage had evaporated and no ground impact was evident. Also, the bottom outlet cap (BOC) was found to be less than tool tight and the bottom outlet valve's (BOV) operating handle was not pinned. The BOC was tool tightened and the BOV handle was pinned.

Mr. Nagy advised the release was indeed a liquid release and not ""venting"". Consignee's representative on hand advised T. J. Mannas that the release was due to the liquid ""fill"" line valve being open less than 1/8 turn, due to the ""securement strap"" for the operating wheel of this valve not being in place and this valve vibrating loose during transit. Consignee representative had tightened the valve and leak stopped. ""Securement strap"" was properly placed against the operating wheel of the ""fill"" valve. Car was released for transportation.

The train dispatcher and crew were notified and the outbound train was brought to a stop on the main line track at Mile Post SG425.8 (Oak Street) in Greenwood.  CSX Transportation immediately implemented their emergency response plan.  CSX management and the local fire department were contacted to respond to the scene.  Chemtrec was notified (Report Number 2007080100070) and the shipper; Transammonia was informed of the suspected release.  In addition, Hepaco Environmental was contacted by CSX to respond and secure the container.  Once on site, the first responders were able to detect a very slight intermittent odor from the ground next to Tank Car GAMX9296.  As a precautionary measure, the Greenwood Fire Department notified the nearest residence (Maxwell Children's Home) of the incident and issued a voluntary evacuation.  The residents followed the advice of the fire department and relocated to another building on the property.  After obtaining the appropriate personal protective equipment, the first responders along with Hepaco representatives opened the protective housing cover of the container and found the release was being emitted from the liquid eduction line gate valve.  Although the valve was properly closed and the plug was tool tight, intermitted vapors bypassed through the threads of the plug.  Hepaco removed and reapplied teflon tape to the plug.  The secondary closure plug was replaced and tightened with a wrench securing the container.  After ensuring all agencies involved (Greenwood Fire Department and South Carolina DHEC) were satisfied that the rail car would no longer release any vapors, it was decided to forward the train to Monroe Yard in Monroe, North Carolina, where the car would be set off awaiting an FRA Movement Exemption.  Upon arrival, the tank car was once again reinspected to ensure proper securement.  Hepaco was requested to continue daily inspection of the railcar until the shipper obtained an FRA Movement Exemption.  On August 2nd, Transammonia obtained FRA Movement Exemption Number FRA-07080235.  After properly stenciling the tank car and adding the exemption information into the waybill, the car was released to destination.  The car arrived at final destination (Honeywell - Hopewell, VA) without further incident on August 9th.

CSX management immediately implemented their emergency response plan and isolated the area around the tank car.  Chemtrec was notified (Report Number 2007080300209) and the car owner; Dow Chemical was informed of the release.  CSX contracted Hepaco Environmental to respond and secure the container.  Once on site, Hepaco representatives found the top operated bottom outlet valve open approximately 1/4 turn.  The valve was then properly closed and the bottom outlet was re-checked for signs of leakage.  Unfortunately, closing the top operated bottom outlet valve did not contain the leak.  Hepaco loosened the bottom outlet auxiliary valve and plug, re-applied teflon tape to the threads, then tightened both with a wrench and the leak subsided.  Dow Chemical was informed that the car may have a defective bottom outlet valve and that they must apply for a FRA Movement Exemption.  The car was placed in bad order status and moved to the car shop repair track.  Approximately two gallons of product was released from the container.

The damage to the drum was due to a puncture by a nail.  United States Environmental Services, Inc. applied absorbent pads to contain the free liquid on the impacted surface.  The damaged drum and the cleanup materials were placed into an over-pack drum.  One over-pack drum containing the damaged drum and cleanup materials was generated as a result of the incident.

While the driver was waiting for a vendor to be towed, the police stopped to direct traffic around the truck.  After the unit sat for awhile on the incline, the officer noticed a drip started coming from the barrel of the cargo tank.  A bucket was put under it and the local hazmat response team was called out.  The drip stopped when they were able to coast the unit to a flat surface.  It was just a couple of miles to the consignee so it was decided to get another tractor hooked to the load, take it to the consignee and get the trailer offloaded as soon as possible.  This was okayed by a gentleman that was a member of the local hazmat team that responded and also worked at the consignee.  This was done successfully.",The trailer was washed and inspected to determine what caused the product to drip from the cargo tank.  The shop found that the gasket on the washout cap had a cut in it allowing product to leak out and get into the insulation and slowly start to drip out.

This stain appeared to have emanated from the manway area. BNSF contract responders inspected UTLX 640566 and reported finding two of eight manway securement bolts at the 3 and 5 o'clock positions only finger tight; and the manway gasket was partially hanging outside of the manway lip. The combination of the loose manway cover securement and the misaligned manway gasket prevented a good seal and contributed to the product release during rail movement. The product outage was deemed sufficient. Responders correctly repositioned the manway gasket and properly secured the manway lid.

BNSF and contract responders inspected GATX 61316 and found the blind flange atop the liquid eduction line was the product leak source. This four bolt blind flange had two C-type washers that encompassed two bolt heads and nuts each. One C-type washer was corroded and allowed one bolt head to be pulled through this washer. This allowed the bolt's compression and the flange securement to loosen. The compromised flange sealing combined with internal tank car pressure build-up due to high ambient temperatures, allowed product to be forced out from under the blind flange. Responders changed out two bolts and applied new individual washers to the bolted connections over the C-type washers, resecuring the blind flange by 0330 hrs. CDT, 8/17/07. BNSF cable seal numbered 001251 was applied atop the secured blind flange. A BNSF environmental contractor neutralized all spillage on the tank shell and onto a very small amount of ground impact spillage.

The flatcar was setout of the train and JBHU 222697 was removed from the flatcar. Inspection of JBHU 222697 revealed eight 5-gallon steel pails loosely wrapped on a pallet with flammable labeling at the rear of the load near the doorway. This shipment was not itemized on the hazardous material billing received and on file. One bottom pail on the pallet had a cut on its sidewall towards the bottom of the pail which appeared to be from a forklift tine. This cut allowed all product within to ooze out. The compromised pail was overpacked and returned to the load after JBHU 222697 was cleaned. JBHU 222697 was reloaded onto the same rail flatcar after its platform was cleaned of all spillage. After arriving at its rail destination (in Portland, OR), JBHU 222697 was noted that not all the former spillage at the rear of the container and chassis was removed. The interior lading was inspected and found to be secure. Shipper contractor cleaned the remaining dried spillage and JBHU 222697 was released to be outgated from the BNSF intermodal facility at Portland.    The material in the pail was labeled as being manufactured by Superior Stone Products, Inc. and identified as Superior Transparent Flowing, a polyester adhesive and filler.

At the time of the release, an employee was loading non-bulk containers of hazardous waste into a tractor trailer at a 10-day transfer facility operated by Clean Harbors Environmental Services (CHES) in Reidsville, NC.   While loading a pallet of cargo onto the trailer utilizing a forklift, an employee punctured a 55 gallon metal drum containing Flammable Liquid, UN1993 that was already in the trailer with the fork-lift fork that was protruding past the pallet being loaded.  The fork punctured the metal drum releasing all of its contents within seconds.      Upon realizing that a release had occurred, the employee immediately evacuated the area and notified his supervisor.  The area was blocked off and all sources of ignition were eliminated.  An in-house spill response crew was dispatched an arrived to the location shortly  They retrieved and reviewed the shipping papers and determined that the material in the drum was Waste Flammable Liquids, n.o.s 3 UN1993, PGIII    After reviewing the shipping papers, the response crew utilizing appropriate personal protection equipment and company health and safety policies and procedures entered the trailer and commenced the clean up operations.  At the time of the release, the trailer was parked in a concrete containment pad and any material that was released from the trailer was confined to the pad.  All of the released material was absorbed using a compatible absorbent and placed in to appropriate containers for future disposal at a permitted hazardous waste disposal facility.      The clean up operation was completed without any further incidents and no of-site impact occurred.",Human error contributed mostly to this release of hazardous materials.  The driver of the forklift as well as all other employees at this location were reminded of proper cargo handling and fork lift operation.

AFFAIRS MANAGER,"18000 72nd Ave S., #217",KENT,WA,98032,Carrier,"Driver was proceeding westbound on I-80 approximately 25 miles southwest of Winnemucca, NV, when he noticed a mist trailing his vehicle in the rearview mirror. Driver pulled off freeway at Exit 158 (Cosgrove Rest Area), turned left under the freeway overpass, and proceeded to the rest area where he parked the vehicle.    Of the estimated <100 gallons of ferric chloride solution that spilled to the roadway, the majority of it was located under the overpass. A thin trail of material was also spilled on the access road to the rest area. No material was released to the land or waterways. The active leak ceased when the driver parked the vehicle.    The driver notified a Nevada Highway Patrol officer that was in the vicinity, and the NHP closed the rest stop and access road. Vehicles that were parked in the rest area were not allowed to leave because they would have to have driven through the spilled material (the rest stop has only one road as a means of ingress/egress). Drivers of the quarantined vehicles were transported to Winnemucca and were provided with hotel rooms for the duration of the cleanup.    An emergency response contractor was brought in to neutralize the spilled material with sodium bicarbonate solution and water. The roadway was pressure washed and decontamination liquids were collected with a vactor truck. The remaining liquid on the tanker was offloaded into poly totes, and all materials were transported to PSC's hazardous waste facility in Fernley, NV.     Upon inspection, a small corrosion hole was found in the bottom 90-degree elbow of the tanker's standpipe. It is assumed that liquid movement in the tank had allowed material to enter the standpipe, and the material was released through the hole. The tanker has been taken out of service, and is currently being repaired in Tacoma, WA.

The cargo tank leaked gasoline contents for approx 4 hours before the tank contents were fully removed. Sand dikes were contructed to contain the released gasoline. After the tank was set upright with crane trucks, pooled product was immediately recovered, and within 10 days, contaminated soils were removed from the shoulder area and disposed. Approx 100 gallons reached the storm drains, which were completely cleaned the next day.

Both of these tank cars were cordoned off and yard operations were ceased. The local F.D. responded and inspected both tank cars, finding only a very slight odor near these railcars and departed after this determination. BNSF and shipper responders inspected these two tank cars and reported finding a slight vapor release from the pressure relief device (PRD) atop GATX 201606 (a DOT 112J340W tank car). Shipper responder replaced both o-rings in the PRD of GATX 201606 which ended the vapor release/product odor by 2240 hrs. PDT, 8/19/07. Responders also reported that the inspection of GATX 201590 revealed that it was not leaking product; and all valves and fittings were secure. Rail operations in the railyard were resumed after GATX 201606 was secured.   On 8/22/07 (at approximately 1700 hrs. PDT), an ammonia odor was again reported in the Riverbank railyard. Rail operations were ceased and five loaded tank cars of anhydrous ammonia in the railyard were identified as possible odor sources. BNSF and shipper responders inspected these tank cars finding four of them secure and the fifth, GATX 201606, again as the odor source.

UTLX 203199 was reported to be continuously leaking from the top protective housing while sitting in the yard, product flowing down the sides of the rail car. The local yardmaster called the shipper and responded Gary Turner at 1600 hrs.Their inspection found the liquid line valve leaking at the base where it is threated to the nipple. The valve was removed, teflon tape was applied to the threads and the valve was secured. On 08/03/07 the car was noted to be leaking again from the top protective housing. Re-inspection by the shipper determined the valve threads were gouged and damaged at the liquid induction threaded nipple. The product pressure increased under the direct heat and high humidity and created a slow but consistent release of the product from the damaged threads. The valve was removed by the shipper and replaced with a new pipe cap. The car was observed later and no further leaks or releases were noted.

Mark Leong to report incident as well as calling the Hawaii Petroleum’s warehouse supervisor Kimo Grace as well as his warehouse worker Lionel Haili to assist in clean up, Michael also called Shirleen Nases the dispatcher to notity the Coast Guard.  6:35AM Michael arrived at spill event at Hilo Pier 3 and assisted Allen in containing, absorbing as well as cleaning pier. During our cleaning of the pier Allen and Michael reviewed incident, while Allen was checking connections of suction hose that runs from trailer to truck he saw that product was starting to spray from hose connection at truck which fell of just as he was about to grab it. Allen then immediately shut off the product at the trailer. He then started trying to contain what he could, after that he radioed Michael.  6:40AM Sheldon Lehman and Mike Thomas from CIC arrived, we reviewed situation and Sheldon immediately started deploying sorbant sweep from pier 3 all the way around pier 2 1/2 to the end of pier 2 to for containment while Mike brought around CIC’s boat. We then tied sorbant sweep to the back of the boat to form a V then pulled the sweep around the harbor to pick up ary product that had escaped before the containment was set up around the pier.  6:42AM Michael called National Response Center to report incident and spoke to Rawls who after having received required information assigned Report # 847236.  6:45AM Kimo arrived with more sorbant pads and assisted in cleaning pier.  6:45AM Michael called Shirleen to verify Coast Guard was called.  6:47AM Michael called State Department of Health Heer to report Spill.  7:00AM Michael received call from HEER Elizabeth Galvez to gover incident and she assigned case # 20070829-0659.  7:10AM Lionel Haili arrived and started assisting Kimo in the pier clean up.  8:55AM Called John Ross the LEPC Civil Defense.  9:00AM Primary containment completed around piers but cruise ship was coming in and Sheldon was concerned with the extra movement of water that would occur when the bow thrusters were used to dock so he suggested we deploy a secondary containment just in case any product got by the first containment as well s running sorbet sweep along the shore line as a precautionary measure.  9:05AM Petty Officer Fallon of the Coast Guard called for an assessment so I brought him up to date on incident.  9:15AM Kimo and Lionel completed cleaning what was on pier 3 and went back to warehouse.  9:30AM Liz Galvaz from HEER requested pictures so I picked up our digital camera and took pictures of CIC boat pulling sorbant sweep outside piers searching for any possible signs of product as well as the sorbant deployed around pier.  10:00AM Seconda",We have reviewed fueling operations manual as well as adding back up security for all fittings.

The checker sent the driver, Quality Carrier, into our office to report it. I immediately went out to assess the situation. The tank container showed no visible sign of damage. The drip was moving at a rate of one drop every five seconds. I had the driver notify his dispatcher and I notified the owner of the tank, Diageo Relay. I notified the Terminal Manager of the situation and he had the tank container segregated in a safe area, away from cargo and human traffic.  The owner sent in Broomall Truck repair service under the advice of Quality Carrier.  Harry Broomall arrived at 1600hrs and checked all the seals on the tank container. After a few adjustments, he stopped the drip.  I checked the tank container again after an hour and there were no signs of dripping.  I notified the owner that the problem was solved.

This search resulted in the inspection of tank car RAIX 6398. The car was located on bowl track 30 and was leaking product from two locations on the top of the tank. The one leak was from beneath the liquid valve flange and the second leak was from the pressure relief valve. The tank was ina shell full condition. The leakage was estimated at about ten gallons per hour and was evaporating as it reached the ground.    The car was relocated onto the drip pans on track 105 at the Livonia yard without incident.    Robinson contacted United States Environmental Services (U.S.E.S), a response contractor and Mr. Joey Dugas of DOW Chemical, the responsible party. Arrangements were made and approximately 2000 gallons of product was removed from the overloaded tank car into a cargo tank truck. DOW will arrange for transportation of both the tank car and the cargo tank truck back to ODFJELL Terminals Houston, at Bayport, TX the point of origin.    After the tank car was relieved at the 2000 gallons of product, U.S.E.S personnel were able to tighten three of the four ecurement bolts on the liquid valve flange approximately three quarters of a turn each.    Supplemental: On Thursday, 8/9/07 Tank car RAIX 6398 was a gain inspected while on track 105 at the UPRR Livonia, LA rail yard by Mgr, Robinson. The car was found to be leaking a small amount of product from the liquid valve flange.

Local Trainmaster, Steve Makoski investigated with a CSXT Special Agent and smelled the odor and heard hissing coming from PROX 89215, Load UN1017 (Chlorine) on meadows yard track #6. The TERP (Transportation Emergency Response Plan) was initiated, and the area near the tank car was isolated. A CSXT Emergency Response Contractor was called to respond, and the consignee was notified. The local fire department and the county hazmat team also responded. The entry team comprised of the Hudson County HazMat Team, CSXT contractor, REACT Environmental Services and the consignee Kuehne Chemical Co. made entry and inspected the railcar. A vapor leak was detected between the PRD (Pressure Relief Device) at the base were the PRD is mounted, B-end right side. Unsuccessful attempts to tighten the stud nuts did not stop the leak. A chlorine âceC-Kitfl (capping kit) was applied to the PRD to mitigate the vapor leak. The car was expedited by CSXT personnel into the Kuehne Chemical Co. facility for emergency off-loading.

While being unloaded with a fork lift at the dock a damp spot was noticed on the floor of the trailer. I (Larry McGillvray) was notified of the apparent leaking shipment. At that time that the spill was noticed the fork lift was shut off untill the leaking product could be identified.We identified the product and found that it was hazardous so the proper paper work was pulled and Chemtrec hotline was called for proper clean up and precautionary measures to be taken for clean up. We followed the clean up requiements and put the leaking containers in an over pack drum for proper disposition. The leaking containers had strarted leaking because of the pressure exerted on the bottom box from the weight of the boxes stacked on top of it. The weight forced the bottom containers to crush under the weight and split on the underside of the plastic bottles against the boards on the pallet.,Use proper loading requirements so that the bottom boxes are not subject to over stress due to too much weight being placed on top of them causing them to be crushed under the load.,No,BOX MULTI-WALL,"Paper, multi-wall box",4M,No,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

Car was located on the north end of track 308 Settegast Yard, Houston, TX. Check of waybill information indicated the car to be a residue empty last containing Sulfuric Acid, Class 8, Corrosive, UN1830. Upon being notified, Manager responded, and requested the RMCC make shipper notification via Chem-Trec.    Upon arrival and inspection of the car, Manager determined the car to be loaded, and noted a failed rupture disk within the safety vent assembly. Less than 1 gallon of product had been released with no impact to drains or waterways, and no reported injuries.    Upon replacement of the rupture disc, the affected areas were neutralized with a sodium bicarbonate solution. The car was then set out pending correct billing of the car. Cause of the release was due to hydraulic surge of the product while the car was being handled.    At 2047hrs, Employee #2, Plant Manager for Southern lonics, was contacted, advised of the release, incorrect billing, and corrective actions taken.    Employee #2, advised that he would have the billing corrected, and would have the car billed back to his facility for off loading and further handling of the car. On 8-24 car FXE 418018 arrived Southern lonics for off loading without further incident.    Cause of the incorrect billing was due to a miscommunication internally within Southern lonics.

Southwest airbill number: 90403876. The description of shipment on this airbill shows to be Biological Substance Category “B”. The leak appeared to come from these coolers but the agents were not 100% sure due to no noticeable evidence other than they were on their side. The smell seemed to be a formalin solution. It appeared that an undetermined amount of liquid had leaked out from one of these coolers and seemed to look more like condensation rather than a spill. After the bin was unloaded, the Pilot notified the Station Manager to call the 3E Company for information on the substance. The cargo freight agent (Edwin Borganic) was notified of the possible spill and he inspected the coolers. He stated that he could not tell that anything had spilled or leaked out of the coolers.

Minimal release was the result of a storage tank receiving design flaw due to an inadequate delivery hose tie-down. Product was being delivered by a delivery hose placed into the top of the storage tank. Pumping action caused the hose to jump and pull out of the top of the tank. 3-5 gallons of product was released onto the floor of the indoor storage area, before the driver was able to shut off the pump and stop the release, The consignee cleaned up the spill immediately.  The driver reported the spill at the time of the spill. This report was not filed within 30 days of the incident due to the incomplete understanding of the reporting requirements by the temporary supervisors on duty at the time. The incident occurred during a transition time after the departure of an experienced supervisor and before the hiring of a permanent replacement. (The temporary supervisors thought the reporting requirements for release were those applicable to spills greater than the reportable quantity (RQ), of which this quantity was less than the RQ.)  On 10-19-07, upon review by senior management, this release was determined to be reportable, although there was no package failure, due to the unintended nature of the release. This report is therefore being filed within 30 days of discovery that it is reportable as an unintended release.","1) We are working with the consignee to improve their process I equipment to ensure a secure hook-up of delivery hose to storage tank.  2) Refresher training for drivers and supervisors, primary and back-up, in reporting requirements completed week of October 22, 2007.  3) Sales, maintenance and driver personnel are being trained to recognize and address safe delivery concerns at customer locations.
