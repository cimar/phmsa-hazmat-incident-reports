OF GRAYS RD. IN SPARROWS POINT, MD. ENROUTE FOR BLUE PLAINS WASTE WATER PROCESSING PLANT IN WASHINGTON, DC. SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER THE DEPARTURE, A HS PROCESSING EMPLOYEE NOTICED SEVERAL DISCHARGES OF MATERIAL ON THE ROADWAY WHERE THE TRUCK HAD MADE TURNS. AMERICAN TANK TRNASPORT WAS ON THE SCENE BY 8:00 PM WITH A CLEAN UP CREW. THE SPILL IS BEST DESCRIBED AS A SPRAY OF MATERIAL THAT CAUSED A SHEEN ON THE ROADWAY IN FRONT OF THE PLANT AND AT THE INTERSECTION OF GRAYS RD. AND WISE AVE.  SPEEDI-DRY ABSORBENT WAS SPREAD ON THE SHEEN AND COLLECTED. LATER DURING THE CLEAN-UP EFFORT, THE BALTIMORE COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TO ASSIST IN THE CLEAN-UP.  THEY CALLED IN THE HAZMAT TEAM TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION.  THE HAZMAT TEAM DIRECTED THE FIRE DEPT. TO SPREAD SAND ONTO THE 2 AREAS.  THE NEXT MORNING WE CLEANED UP THE SAND AT YOUR DIRECTION. WE ESTIMATED THE SPILL TO BE MORE THAN 8-10 GALLONS OF MATERIAL.  IT WAS SPREAD INTO A SHEEN, THEREFORE NO PUDDLING EXISTED.  THE MATERIAL WAS LISTED A <1% ACID. THE TRAILER WAS THROUGHLY INSPECTED FOR SIGNS OF LEAKAGE (FAILED RUPTURE DISC, FAILED AIR INLET VALVE, POOR SEAL ON RUBBER DOME, ETC.).  NO MECHANICAL REASON WAS FOUND FOR THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIAL.  THE DRIVER OF THE UNIT CLAIMS NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE SPILL. IN ORDER TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING AGAIN, IT WILL BECOME MANDITORY FOR ALL DRIVERS TO CONDUCT A ""SLUSH TEST"" BEFORE LEAVING THE LOADING AREA TO ASSURE THAT ALL VALVES AND DOMEWAYS DO NOT HAVE LEAKS.

DRIVER WAS MAKING A DELIVERY @ 955 DILLON ST.  HE WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 10 MPH, STOPPED (IN ORDER TO BACK INTO THE DOCK), AND THOUGHT HE HEARD/FELT SOMETHING FALL IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK AT THAT TIME.  BACKED INTO DOCK, OPENED OVERHEAD DOOR AND DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THE PLASTIC DRUMS HAD FALLEN AND WAS EMPTYING OUT ON THE TRUCK FLOOR.  THE AREA WAS SECURED AND NO ONE WAS ALLOWED INTO THE TRUCK.  DRIVER CALLED SAFETY DIRECTOR TO REPORT SPILL.  CHICAGO TERMINAL MANAGER WAS NOTIFIED AND SENT OVER TO SCENE TO ASSESS THE SITUATION.  CALLS WERE MADE TO ILLINOIS DOT AND LOCAL FIRE OFFICIALS FOR CLEAN UP RECOMMEDATIONS.  TOLD TO USE LIME AND WATER TO NEUTRALIZE ACID.  HAD A POWER WASHING COMPANY REPORT TO SPILL LOCATION AND POWER WASH THEIR DOCK.  JOB COMPLETED SAME DAY.  TOOK TRAILER AND REMAINING FREIGHT BACK TO TERMINAL.  SORTED THROUGH FREIGHT - SEPARATED DAMAGED FROM UNDAMAGED.  UNDAMAGED FREIGHT WAS LOADED ONTO ANOTHER TRUCK AND DELIVERED. DAMAGED FREIGHT WAS SET ASIDE UNTIL SHIPPER'S COULD BE CONTACTED.  CLEANED TRAILER WITH SEVERAL APPLICATIONS OF LIME AND WATER, THEN SENT TRAILER BACK TO ROCKFORD TERMINAL TO BE STEAM CLEANED SEVERAL TIMES AND TO CHECK FOR FLOOR AND WIRE DAMAGE.  NO DAMAGE TO WIRES UNDER TRAILER.  FLOOR STAINED A LITTLE.  CLEANED UP WELL AND HAD BEEN PUT BACK INTO SERVICE.  SHOULD BE NOTED: WHEN THIS SHIPMENT WAS PICKED UP AT ORIGINAL SHIPPER'S DOCK, TODD DRIVER HAD TO REQUEST THAT CONTAINERS BE CLEANED OFF AND LIDS BE TIGHTENED.  CLEAR LIQUID WAS ON TOP OF DRUMS, AND ALL OF THE CAPS ON THE DRUMS WERE LOOSE.  DOCK PERSON TIGHTENED LIDS. ALL 6 (SIX) BARRELLS WERE STRETCH WRAPPED TO EACH OTHER, BUT WERE ONLY ANCHORED TO THE SKID AT ONE LOCATION.  TODD DRIVERS HAVE BEEN ALERTED TO THIS SITUATION AND HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO RE-WRAP SUCH TYPES OF SHIPMENTS AND ANCHOR THE STRETCH WRAP TO ALL FOUR CORNERS OF THE SKID.  PLASTIC BARRELLS/DRUMS HAVE A GREATER TENDANCY TO ""WALK OFF"" OF SKIDS THAN DO STEEL DRUMS.  OUR DRIVER FELT THAT HE HAD SECURED THE LOAD WELL ENOUGH, BUT OUR INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT IT WAS NOT.  DRIVER HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED ON PROPER CARGO SECUREMENT AND ENCOURAGED TO SEEK ASSISTANCE WHEN IN DOUBT.  EVEN THOUGH LIDS WERE TIGHTENED AT THE TIME OF PICK UP AND THEY EWRE THREADED THE LID FLEW SEVERAL FEET WHEN THE DRUM FELL OVER.  THE DRUM ITSELF REMAINED INTACT.  WE FEEL THAT THE LID SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAY IN PLACE, CONSIDERING THIS WAS NOT A SEVERE ACCIDENT OF A TREMENDOUS BLOW OR SHOCK TO THE CONTAINER.  THE LIDS HAD BEEN TIGHTENED, THE FREIGHT SAT ON OUR DOCK OVER THE WEEKEND, AND THE RODE ON OUR TRUCK FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT 5 MINUTES.  THESE DRUMS ARE REUSABLE.  THEY ARE TO BE RETURNED FOR REFUND WHEN EMPTY.  WE WONDER IF THIS ONE HAS BEEN IN THE SYSTEM TOO LONG?

AFTER FILLING COMPARTMENT NUMBER TWO OF THE TRIALER WITH UNLEADED PLUS, I HAD THE DRIVER INCREASE THE R.P.M'S TO BLOW THE HOSES CLEAR OF PRODUCT.  IN DOING SO, THE SURGE OF AIR INTO THE COMPARTMENT CAUSED APPROXIMATELY ONE TO THREE GALLONS OF GASOLINE TO BE RELEASED FROM THE TOP OF THE COMPARTMENT.

THE STATION LEASEE IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  I CALLED L.I.C.

HOWEVER, THEY SPREAD SPEEDY DRY ON THE TWELVE BY SIX FOOT SPILL AREA.  AT 1:30P.M., ONE MAN FROM TYREE SHOWED UP AND UNCOVERED THE STORM BASIN.  HE THREW SIX ABSORPTION PADS IN, AND PULLED THEM OUT.  HE REPEATED THIS PROCEDURE, THEN LEFT FIVE MORE PADS IN THE WELL.  IN HIS OPINION, APPROXIMATELY A GALLON OF GASOLINE GOT INTO THE BASIN.

A CALL WAS PLACED TO CHEMTREC DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE FUMES OF THE LIQUID WERE GETTING STRONGER AND NON-RESTRICTED PAPERWORK ACCOMPANIED THE SHIPMENT.  CHEMTREC FAXED THE MSDS FOR THIS SHIPMENT THAT ROHM AND HAAS FILED WITH THEM.  THE MSDS STATED THAT THE TOXICITY WAS A '3' AND THE DOT CLASSIFICTION WAS ""CORROSIVE MATERIAL"".  AT 0900 ON NOVEMBER 23, 1991 A CALL WAS PLACED FROM JOY SMITH (BURLINGTON PERSON ON DUTY AT THE MDW STATION) TO JIM ANGELO TO INFORM HIM OF THE PROBLEM.  THE CONTAINER WITH THE LEAKING SHIPMENT WAS PUSHED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING TO LIMIT THE FUMES INSIDE. AT THAT TIME JOY WAS INSTRUCTED TO TURN THE HEAT OFF IN THE OFFICE SO NOTHING WOULD BE DRAWN INTO THE OFFICE, TO OPEN ALL THE DOCK DOORS, CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED THE EPA. THE HAZMAT SQUAD OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ALONG WITH THE EPA SHOWED UP AND REFUSED TO LET ANYONE BACK INTO THE SITE.  ILLINOIS DOT HAZMAT TROOPER WAS ALSO ON SITE.  THEY THEN PROCEEDED TO CONTAIN THE SPILL WITH SODA ASH. DUE TO THE FREEZING TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE, THE LIQUID SLOWED AND STOPPED FLOWING.  WHEN THE SALVAGE CREW CONTAINED THE BARREL, THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL AND THE LOWER SIDES DID NOT HAVE ANY HOLES. THE LIQUID 'APPEARED' TO BE LEAKING FROM THE SEAMS OF THE TERMINAL WITH AN SIR METER TO CHECK THE TERMINAL FOR SAFETY.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE AIR QUALITY WAS SAFE & COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT & EPA COULD BE RESUMED AT THE TERMINAL RATHER THAN IN THE COMMAND BUS.  AT THAT TIME THE PHONES WERE FORWARDED TO THE ORD STATION.  OHM CORP, A HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL COMPANY, WAS CALLED FOR THE CLEAN UP AND FINAL CONTAINMENT PROCESS.  AT APPROX 1800, NOVEMBER 23, 1991 THE SUPERVISOR OF OHM ARRIVED TO SET UP THE NEEDED TEAM.  AT APPROX 1900 NOVEMBER 23, 1991 THE CREW FROM OHM ARRIVED. THE SPILL WAS COVERED WITH LIME TO NEUTRALIZE THE SPILL WHICH HAS A PH OF 1.8 TO 3.0.  AFTER THE INSIDE OF THE BUILDING WAS CLEANED, THE CREW MOVED TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING TO CONTAIN THE REMAINING BARREL AND CLEAN UP THE ULD.  AFTER THE OUTSIDE WAS CLEANED UP, EVERYTHING WAS PLACED IN 3 SALVAGE BINS AND PLACED INSIDE THE ULD.  THE ULD WAS BROUGHT INSIDE, COVERED WITH PLASTIC & PLACED IN THE BACK OF THE DOCK IN A SECURE AREA FOR FURTHER PROPER DISPOSAL.  ON MONDAY NOVEMBER 25, 1991 THE PHONE CALLED STARTED.  THE FIRST CALL WAS PLACED TO THE BUREAU OF DANGEROUS GOODS, RUSS BOWEN TO INFORM HIM OF THE ENTIRE INCIDENT.  HE STARTED TO IMPOUND THE REMAINING 2 PIECES OF THE SHIPMENT, FAX ALL THE PAPERWORK TO HIM VIA REGISTERED, RETURN-RECEIPT MAIL, FILL OUT A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL INCIDENT REPORT AND FAX THAT TO HIM.
