Straps over the pallet of adhesives did not tear but it weakend the cardboard allowing the strap to sink down some allowing containers to slide out or the strap and shrink wrap.  10 containers opened upon impact with the ground spilling part of the 5 gallons of adhesive that they held.    Bergen County Police responded and a local hazmat crew.  They spread stay dry and shoveled the stay dry and the spilled adhesive into large containers.    The spill was contained on the macadam in lanes 2 and 3 of a 4 lane highway. The highway never completely shut down and there was no soil contamination.,We are checking into plastic corner protectors that run the length of the pallet to see is it would help to have one on each side of a pallet of adhesives.

Movement was stopped and a nearby BNSF response contractor was called to eliminate the leak source and remediate spillage on the tank shell. The responders removed intact seal WIC 368556 on the valve housing cover to inspect the valves. All valves were found closed with their closure plugs secure. The manway cover's intact seal WIC 368555 was removed to inspect the manway gasket. The manway securement bolts were found less than tool tight and the manway gasket was found out of position; both attributing to and preventing a good seal. The responders cleaned and correctly repositioned the manway gasket; and properly tool tightened all six manway securement bolts by 2000 hrs. CDT, 8/4/09. New seals numbered SRS 000363 and 000367 were affixed onto the valve housing cover and the manway respectively. The spillage on the top and side shell of GATX 49581 was neutralized with an application of a magnesium oxide solution by 2110 hrs. CDT, 8/04/09. No ground impact from the spillage was evident.

On 08/18/09 it was loaded onto our truck and departed our Bartow, FL terminal.  The driver parked in a parking lot in Lake Wales, FL while he ate his lunch.  Before beginning the drive again, the driver inspected the truck and found material dripping from the back door of the trailer.  The driver created a dike with absorbent material to prevent the leaking material from spreading further and then called our emergency number.  Emergency Response teams were dispatched from our terminal and a private contractor was also dispatched.      The drum had developed internal pressure that resulted in a 3"" crack near the top of the body of the drum, releasing the material onto the floor of the trailer.  Most material was contained within the trailer, however, approximately 5 gallons were released to the asphalt parking lot.    The leaking drum was overpacked.  All absorbent material was collected and the affected area was treated with lime to neutralize the acid.  This was also collected and all cleanup material was placed into a drum for disposal at a licensed disposal facility.  The truck returned to our terminal and was off-loaded.  The floor of the truck was then decontaminated.","Better training is required for generators of hazardous wastes, particularly when different materials are combined to form solutions of more than one hazardous material.

The drum was then tilted to see where the leak was coming from. The lower rim appeared to have a small pin size hole in it. The drum was tilted on its side to prevent more product loss. Further review of the location of the hole indicated that the drum had been dragged or rubbed against an abrasive surface on one edge long enough to wear through the beading on the bottom of the drum. Best estimate the leak started in transit due to the vibration of the drum on the trailer floor. About 6 oz had leaked in the trailer the other 10 were due to tilting and moving of the drum to a secure location.,"Additional padding or cardboard placed under the drum may have prevented the leak, but the drum was defective when the shipment was loaded.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CON-WAY FREIGHT,US,

An MSDS was requested from the freight forwarder. The MSDS that was supplied by the forwarder was ambiguous with respect to transportation restrictions and since the flash point stated was 93 degrees F. we requested a more definitive MSDS. The same exact MSDS was supplied by the forwarder, with one change, that being; the words(IATA: Not Regulated) had been added to the MSDS. At that time we querried the manufacturer who pointed us to their website, assuring us that the web site had the most up-to-date MSDS' for their products. We checked said web site and discovered that there was indeed no verbage to the effect (IATA: Not Regulated) on their MSDS. At this point we suspected that the MSDS had been altered to facilitate transport and notified the 24 office of the FAA.

The contents of the IBC immediately began to empty out inside the trailer until the IBC was empty.  An emergency response company was immediately contacted for clean up of material and remediation of the area.    Further inspection of the valve area by the clean up company showed that the bottom gravity flow valve was held in place by a plastic retaining ring and two small bolts to crimp it closed around the valve.  The plastic retaining ring had broken/seperated at the bolt area thus releasing the valve from the body of the IBC.    Due to the amount of liquid spilled and clean up, removal of material, and disposal the packaging specification were not able to be obtained.","Although not able to see the actual set up of the IBC valve, it sounds like it was a fairly inexpensive set up to up back a regulated corrosive material but that is only speculation.",Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,5500,"Pitt Ohio Express, LLC",US,

KIRBY,DISTRICT OPERATIONS MANAGER,4351 Director Dr,SAN ANTONIO,TX,78219,Other-I'm the responsible mana,"Around 7:50 AM an employee was loading the daily deliveries on to a trailer.  The loading process is done from the dock via Forklift.  While the employee was entering a trailer to load an IBC that contained Sulfuric Acid  the material suddenly shifted causing the IBC to flip on it’s side.  When the IBC landed on the dock the impact caused the top cap to blow off from the IBC causing material to spill out.  Approximately 50 gallons was released onto and below the dock area.  The other employees donned on their PPE while the forklift operator was able to lift the tote high enough to stop the flow of the acid.  Quickly the operator also donned on his PPE. To prevent injury and splashing the IBC was covered with a plastic sheet while the IBC was rested to it’s upright position.  The spilled material was quickly dike off and neutralized with a large amount of Soda Ash.   After the acid was able to be neutralized with the soda ash, it was swept up and placed in the proper containers and then staged in the satellite accumulation area. The affected area was then washed down.  The water that was used to wash down the area was vacuumed and pumped into the neutralization pit.  The rest of the material contained in the IBC will be transferred to another IBC before it is sent back to the Odessa branch to be tested in order to see if the material can be topped off and to be resold.  The IBC, (serial #OD11892) that was involved in the spill will also be sent back to Odessa to be inspected and retested to insure that the IBC is safe for reuse.",THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTALBE IF THE EMPLOYEE WOULD HAVE SLOWED DOWN AND TAKEN MORE CAREFUL TIME TO LOAD THE IBC ONTO THE TRAILER.  EMPLOYEE FORKLIFT TRAINING WAS CHECKED FOR CURRENCY WHICH IT WAS UP TO DATE.  THE EMPLOYEE AGREED THAT IT WAS A PREVENTABLE INCIDENT.  TRAINING WAS ALSO TAKEN AGAIN TO REMIND THE EMPLOYEE THE SAFEST OPERATONAL PROCESSES IN OPERATION OF A FORKLIFT AND LOADING PROCEDURES.,No,IBC,"For liquids, when stacked",31H1,Yes,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA Inc.,US,

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at Clean Harbor's in transit storage area for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantties of material for continued transportation.  During the course of this layover, an inspection of the load identified that 2 of the containers ruputered due to an over pressuization condition that we believe to have been cause by a chemical reaction and an increae in ambient temperature.  Once identified, an emergecny reposnse team was assembled and the the shippin gpapers were reviewed.  Following all health and safety protocols, the identify of the containers in question were found and a plan was developed to enter the trailer, remove all unaffected containers and intiate the clean-up.  Please note all material released remained within the trailer.  Once the containers were identified, a suitable absorbent was used to collect all freee liquids and this was containerized along with the damaged containers for disposal at a licensed waste management facility.  In addition, all of the drums that contained the same waste stream were segregated and the closures were removed to releive any pressure that was potneitally building in the remaining drums.  It was decided to accept these containers at the Clean Harbor's hazardous waste treatement facility adjacent to the in transit facility rather than ship them for continued transportation.  All mateiral was treated and disposed of safely.  The final step was to decontaminate the interior of the trailer.  all supplies used to decontaminate the trailer were containerized and disposed of at an appropriate waste management facility.","At the time the containers were accepted for transportation, no evidence of pressurization was observed nor was any adverse observations identified when the containers were consolidated for continuing transportation.  What is believed to have happened was that one consitiuient of the waste stream (sodium bicarbonate) reacted with a water component in the waste stream and released carbon disoxide as the ambient temperature began to rise.  In order to prevent a recurrence, the shipper of this waste stream has put into place a new process by which they will pretreat the waste to consume all of the sodium bicarbonate beofre the offer for transportation.  Each shipment will be accompanied by a signed certification that the material has been treated and that the sodium bicarbonate is no longer an active component of the waste stream.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,16915,"Clean Harbors Environemntal Services, Inc.",US,

At the conclusion of the laoding operation, the load was inspected and it was discovered that the fork-lift used to transfer the materials punctured the container allowing a small amount of material to escape onto the side of the container and the floor of the van trailer.  A response team was assembled and the crew, after donning the appropriate protective equipment, entered the trailer and proceeded to place the damaged container into a suitable salvage container.

Further investigation by R. Gould, REACT Environmental Services (called out to respond by Conrail) and Conrail's A. Richter, noted the 165# Oseco-style rupture disc had burst as designed.  During inspection, also noted the safety vent frangible disc inspection plug retainer ring (identified as the Rupture Disc Securement Cap for this style valve, SALCO) was broken at about a 1"" section.  The retainer ring was removed, along with the ruptured disc.  Viewing inside, there was no evidence of baffle/surge protection.  Car built date noted as ""7/93"".  Notwithstanding AAR Manual of Standards and Recommended Practices, Section C-III, Specification for Tank Cars, Appendix A4.7.4. (requiring surge pressure reduction devices on new order, converted or rebuilt tank cars effective May 1, 1994), the drawings/installation instructions (supplied by the shipper, PVS Technologies) for the style of SALCO Quick Inspect Safety Vents notes a surge protection device applied.      The ruptured 165# OSECO disc was replaced in kind, the broken threaded retaining ring/securement cap was reapplied at time of inspection.  Car was wiped down of any remaining residue of product that remained (a strong rain storm had passed through the area between the time of reporting of this incident, and the inspection).  Car was moved to the Car Shop area.  Further conversations with actual loader of car, Solvay Solexis, Thorofare, NJ; the waybill shipper/consignee, PVS Technologies, Detroit, MI; and, the product owner, Reagent Chemicals; whereby Reagent arranged for their personnel to respond to the Pavonia Yard Car Shop, replace the broken threaded retaining ring and inspect for a baffled surge protection device.  Later advised via email by car builder, GATC, that this car was supposed to be equipped with a surge protection device.  During observation from the top of the safety vent with the inspection plug, threaded retaining ring and burst disc removed, both REACT and Conrail did not observe another fitting/device between the top of the safety vent assembly and the top of the liquid level inside the car.      Car okayed after final repairs and inspection by Reagent Chemical team, for movement to original destination, PVS Technologies, Detroit, MI, for unloading and further inspection of the safety vent assembly to ascertain the presence or not of the surge protection device.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Consolidated Rail Corporation,US,

Our Driver was Northbound on AL HWY 67.  The Other vehicle driver failed to yield and pulled across the intersection in front of our vehicle.  Our driver tried to avoid the other vehicle by swerving to the right.  The other vehicle struck our truck and the impact caused our driver to lose control which resulted in our vehicle overturning.  A small release of propane occurred because of the damage to our truck.

He thought the level of the tank would go to 750, the trailer would be empty and the unload would be complete.  By time he realized that the level on the tank was going past the 750 mark and the hose hadn't jumped yet (from being empty), the storage tank overflowed.  driver later realized he had another BOL and actually had 1300 gallons in the cargo tank to start.

Afterwards, BNSF contract responders with air monitoring equipment also inspected GATX 201248 finding its 280.5 psi pressure relief device (PRD) as the source point of the product vapor/odor. Further inspection of the PRD revealed that the seat and stem O-rings had the appearance of a 'compression set' failure, i.e., O-ring flattening at the seal mating/contact surface. The PRD O-rings were replaced in kind by 0805 hrs. CDT, 8/08/09. After the PRD was secured, no further product odor/vapor was detectable by the responder's monitoring equipment.

Shipper/offeror of tank car, Kinder Morgan, Carteret, NJ, contacted via CHEMTREC by CR Risk Manager A. Richter.  Mr. Brian McGeehan, representative of the shipper, advised he had contracted with mobil repair unit of UTC to repair/replace the vaccum relief device.  Mr. Richter advised Mr. McGeehan that if the fitting were replaced or removed for any purpose, the car would require a bubble-leak test prior to movement.    Mr. McGeehan contacted Mr. Richter a few days later, indicating the car's vaccum releif device had been changed out, in kind, and that movement approval was obtained from the FRA to have the car moved onto a shop (UTLX shop, Marion, OH) for further inspection, and bubble leak test prior to being placed back into service.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at Clean Harbors' in-transit storage facility for the purpose of consolidating less than the truck load quantities of containers onto a single vehicle for the purpose of continuing transportation.  During the transfer operation, a pallet containing several non-bulk packages failed when it was being moved with a fork-lift allwoing one container to fall.  The container struck the inside wall of the trailer causing a gash to develop in the side of the container.  As a result of the incident it is estimated that approximately five (5) gallons of material escaped from the package onto the floor of the trailer.  A response team was assembled and utilizing appropriate protective equipment, the team entered the trailer and placed the damaged container into a suitable salvage drum.  All free liquid was absorbed with a suitable absorbent material and placed into the salvage drum along with all materials used to decontaminate the trailer floor.  Once secure, the container was placed on the alternative vehicle for continued transportation.",In order to prevent a recurrence the individuals involved in the loading and unloading operation at this location have been retrained to ensure they inspect all containers and pallets before they initiate the movement in order to ensure each container is evenly distributed on the pallet and that the pallet itself is free of any visible defects or damage that could compromise the structural integrity of the pallet.,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1000,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

The punture was in the lower 1/3 of the IBC. This caused the release. The terminal manager ordered the IBC removed from the dock to protect the employees. Upon removing the trailer from the dock the material spilled into a storm drain located adjacent to the door the trailer was being moved from. Approx 30 gallons was released into the drain. The manager ordered the material to be moved to the far corner of the facility. During the transit of the material to the location marked by the manager the material continued to spill out of the container into the carriers lot. While the employees were covering the material with oil dry as ordered by the manager the IBC earlier placed at the far end of the facility had started to produce small flames and smoke. At this time the fire department responded. U/A of the fire dept. the IC had determined this to be a haz mat incident and the necessary equipment was dispatched to the facility. The material that had earlier spilled on the ground started to react with the oil in the asphalt and produced several hot spots and flare ups around the facility. The determination was made to evacuate the premises. Immediately upon notification to the company's haz mat and environmental manager an emergency response clean up team was dispatched. The fire department cleared the clean up team was allowed access to the scene to begin the work at 15:30. The clean up continued until approx 20:00. The fire department provided and engine to supply water during the clean up. The fire departmnet was advised to flush the drain with copius amounts of water as this was a water treatment material. One employe was hospitalized for 3 days and treated for respritory distress. He had a pre existing condition which intensified the effects of the exposure. The other employee was treated and released. The incident was concluded on August 21 and all material both debris and remaining product were disposed of according to regulations.

During the loading process, the shipper requestd that we include in the pick up addiotnal material comprosed of the same waste stream from two additonal storage containers.  The additonalloading operation was completed and the driver secured the cargo tank's closure devices in preparation for transportation.  Once secured, the driver proceeded to the facility's guard shack in ordert o sign out pror to departure.  While at the guard shack, the driver noticed that material was escaping from the top dome cover of the cargo tank.  The driver immedialtey reported the release and secured the area pending the arrival of an emergency reposne crew.  Upon arrival, the crew, wearing appropriate personal protective equipment  approached the vehicle and upon inspection of the tank, it was decided to off-load the material back into the original storage tanks as it was evident that a reaction was occuring that was creating a pressure buildup within the container.  The crew oened the dome hatch to relieve the pressure and initiated a transfer operation to move the material back into the origial storage vessels in order to allow the shipper the opportunity to stabilze the material.  This operation was done without incident.  In addition, the crew decontaminated the cargo tank and containerized approximatley 4 x 55 gallon containers of contaminated soil.  Once the cargo tank was cleaned and secured and the contaminated debris was containerized, the driver secured the vehicle and departed the site.","At the conclusion of the response activities, it was determined that the two additional containers we were asked to include in the shipment were, in fact not identical.  It has been reported that the additional material contained aluminum in addition to the sodium hydroxide and this is what cause the pressure build-up.  The shipper will reevaluate the waste stream and ensure that all components are properly identified and stored in such a way to preclude an adverse condition while in storage or transportation.  In addition, it was observed that when the man way was opened that the gasket appeared to be misaligned.  It is not clear if this was an error of the part of the driver when the man way was secured or it was caused by the over pressurization.  The driver has been re instructed on the proper procedure for securing a man way and a new gasket was installed in this unit.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5657,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

Freight loaded onto destination trailer at 1739.  08/05/09 2345 - TNXE driver arrived at Midamerica Airport dock, opened trailer doors and detected an odor.  No signs of leakage within trailer were found.  Entire contents of trailer (multiple shipments - both haz and non-haz) unloaded onto airport dock.  One of the two shrink-wrapped skids containing MEK was then disassembled.  An external inspection of the boxes by dock personnel did not reveal any to be damaged, wet or leaking.  Dock personnel notified their chain of command.  The shipper and Chemtrec were contacted.  Fire Department arrived.  A hazmat team arrived. TNXE driver and facility personnel were evacuated 150 feet from the building. Evacuees were updated every 15-20 minutes by liaison coordinator as to progress.  Initial search by hazmat team unsuccessful in determining which boxes were causing the odor.  All boxes were then opened.  Three boxes, when the interior plastic bags were opened, caused their readings to spike to 160 ppm.  These three boxes were then segregated and placed in a drum.  These boxes contained nine (9), 1-Liter plastic bottles with a cardboard separator placed in a plastic bag.  The plastic bottles had screw-on caps, none of which were found to be loose.  According to the hazmat team leader, whereas no leakage was observed in the plastic bags, MEK evaporates at an extremely fast rate.  The cause of the vapor release was undetermined.  08/06/09 0515 - TNXE driver advised he was awaiting decision as to how much freight was going to be accepted/rejected.  08/06/09 0645 - TNXE driver advised the entire hazmat shipment consisting of Printing ink-related material and MEK was refused and loaded back onto his trailer minus the three boxes in the drum being held  at the airport facility dock; all other non-haz shipments and one other Class 3 hazmat shipment (Isopropanol) were accepted to forwarding to their respective destinations.","At the post-incident interview with our driver, I learned that while evacuated, he was twice approached and asked details of the hazardous materials he transported to the facility. Both times he directed the questioner to the facility personnel who was last in possession of the shipping papers before the evacuation.  I was in possession of copies of the hazmat shipping doc information for all three Class 3 hazardous shipments as well as the three pertinent ERG page numbers.  If needed, I thought an official at the site would've called the carrier for this information.

Response by FD and cleanup contractor.,"The preventability of this incident is not clear and thus, shall be ruled non-preventable. There may have been steps taken that could have prevented this incident, but it is felt that everyone in this situation acted reasonably and as trained to. What was learned here, is that pumps can shift/twist in their mounts and that PTO shafts have separated in this fashion, in the past. This is contradictory to what a number of our professionals had assumed was physically possible, in the past. So we ask that all Drivers and Maintenance Personnel be aware of this potential issue, know the equipment and it's limitations well, and inspect it accordingly, at every opportunity. We also recommend an investigation by our maintenance department of a more secure installation of PTO driven pumps to keep them from twisting on their own, fitting PTO shafts with the female end facing forward, and installing a retention mechanism to keep PTO shafts from falling to the pavement or being whipped around, if they become detached at either end, to reduce the risk of further damage/injury.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,12360,,,

On our return trip from Southaven our driver (Doug Lewis) stopped on the side of Hwy 301 south of Stateline Rd. to check his trailer.  At this time he noticed an ammonia smell and saw a small leak come from under his dust cap on his outlet valve on trailer.  At this time he removed his dust cover and product begun to leak out onto the side of road.  At this time he realized he had not completely shut his valve which he did at this point.  The trailer had a hill left in the trailer from the load to TVA-Southaven.  During this time a person passing by reported a trailer leak incident to Walls Fire Dept.  They responded to the scene of the incident and the responder came in contact with our driver, and he called for backup because of the smell of ammonium and that it was a HAZMAT product leak.  When the Walls Fire Dept. HAZMAT crew arrived, they sent our driver and the first responder to Baptist Memorial Hospital to be checked out and decontaminated.  At this time I was notified by Mike Hancock with the fire dept. and told of the situation.  Mike Hancock told me that he had contacted United States Environmental Services (USES) in Southaven and they were on the way to the scene.  I informed Mike that our company has a contract with USES to assist us in the case of emergency.  At this time I left Monroe, LA en route heading to Southaven to the scene.  On the way I called and talked with Kenneth Hays with USES and he let me know that the clean up was under control and stated that it appeared to him that it was a small amount that had leaked on the ground but that the odor was strong.  He also let me know he had talked with Barry McMaster with DEQ and he had recommended that we remove an inch of the dirt from the area of spill and reseed with grass and put hay on it to keep it from washing.  I told him to go ahead and do what was needed and I would see him when I arrived.  Before I could arrive from the drive from Monroe, Kenneth called and let me know that the clean up was complete and that the driver and first responder were released from the hospital with no injuries.","When we got driver, truck and trailer back to yard in Monroe, LA, we started an investigation of the incident.  We looked at the valve to make sure that the valve was in working order and that it was not damaged.  Finding from our investigation was that the incident was cause due to human error on our driver. This driver had been with the company for 4 years and had been trained annually with our other drivers on the procedure of loading and unloading of Aqua Ammonia Solution.  After the findings of the investigation we terminated the employment of the driver (Doug Lewis) for his actions of not following procedures.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5439,"OUACHITA FERTILIZER TRANSPORT, LLC",US,

At approximately 0815 one of the Transportation Security Administration (ISA) agents advised an American Eagle employee that they needed to contact passenger De Pena in order to open his bag as they had detected a suspicious content in his bag.  ISA agent identified a small, broken, glass jar with a silver liquid spilled inside the bag and immediately notified the Airport Fire and Rescue Department.  By 0845 the ticket counter area and terminal hallway were cleared; employees and passengers were evacuated from the terminal.  The ticket counter was closed for approximately six (6) hours, from 0845-1500.  An area of 150'' around the bag was cordoned off and several local, state and federal agencies coordinated the response efforts.  American Eagle contracted a HAZMAT company to perform the removal and disposition of the spilled substance.  Operations were partially restored by 1500 and fully restored by 1800.
