WHEN THE DRIVER SAW A GLOW ON THE RIGHT REAR AXLE OF THE SEMI-TRAILER. THE DRIVER PULLED TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE ROADWAY TO INVESTIGATE THE GLOW. THE RIGHT REAR AXLE OF THE SEMI-TRAILER HAD CAUGHT FIRE. THE DRIVER THEN DISCONNECTED HIS TRUCK FROM THE SEMI-TRAILER AND DROVE IT TO A SAFE AREA. THE SEMI-TRAILER THEN PARTIALLY BURNED. DURING THE FIRE, THREE ACETYLENE BOTTLE'S FUSIBLE METAL RELIEF VALVES RELEASED THE BOTTLE'S CONTENTS AND A FOURTH ACETYLENE BOTTLE RUPTURED (APPROXIMATELY 76 LBS. OF ACETYLENE GAS TOTAL IN THE FOUR BOTTLES). ALSO, TWELVE OXYGEN BOTTLES RELEASED THEIR CONTENT DURING THE FIRE (APPROXIMATELY 336 LBS. OF OXYGEN). THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE FIRE CANNOT BE DETERMINED DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE FIRE DAMAGE TO THE RIGHT REAR AXLE WHERE THE FIRE STARTED BUT OUT INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE WAS AN OIL SEAL ON THE RIGHT REAR AXLE. WHEN THE OIL SEAL WENT OUT THE LUBRICATING OIL WAS THROWN OUT ONTO THE TIRES AND THE RESULTING HEAT FROM THE LACK OF LUBRICANT CAUSED THE FIRE TO START. OUR MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT HAS INCREASED INSPECTIONS OF THIS AREA TO PREVENT FUTURE OCCURENCES. ALL AND/OR PART OF US 59 IN THIS AREA WAS CLOSED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THE CITY OF EDNA FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO THE FIRE AND DID A COMMENDABLE JOB OF CONTROLLING THE FIRE AND PROTECTING LIVES AND PROPERTY. THERE WERE NO INJURIES DUE TO THE INCIDENT.

WHEN THE DRIVER SAW A GLOW ON THE RIGHT REAR AXLE OF THE SEMI-TRAILER. THE DRIVER PULLED TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE ROADWAY TO INVESTIGATE THE GLOW. THE RIGHT REAR AXLE OF THE SEMI-TRAILER HAD CAUGHT FIRE. THE DRIVER THEN DISCONNECTED HIS TRUCK FROM THE SEMI-TRAILER AND DROVE IT TO A SAFE AREA. THE SEMI-TRAILER THEN PARTIALLY BURNED. DURING THE FIRE, THREE ACETYLENE BOTTLE'S FUSIBLE METAL RELIEF VALVES RELEASED THE BOTTLE'S CONTENTS AND A FOURTH ACETYLENE BOTTLE RUPTURED (APPROXIMATELY 76 LBS. OF ACETYLENE GAS TOTAL IN THE FOUR BOTTLES). ALSO, TWELVE OXYGEN BOTTLES RELEASED THEIR CONTENT DURING THE FIRE (APPROXIMATELY 336 LBS. OF OXYGEN). THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE FIRE CANNOT BE DETERMINED DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE FIRE DAMAGE TO THE RIGHT REAR AXLE WHERE THE FIRE STARTED BUT OUT INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE WAS AN OIL SEAL ON THE RIGHT REAR AXLE. WHEN THE OIL SEAL WENT OUT THE LUBRICATING OIL WAS THROWN OUT ONTO THE TIRES AND THE RESULTING HEAT FROM THE LACK OF LUBRICANT CAUSED THE FIRE TO START. OUR MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT HAS INCREASED INSPECTIONS OF THIS AREA TO PREVENT FUTURE OCCURENCES. ALL AND/OR PART OF US 59 IN THIS AREA WAS CLOSED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. THE CITY OF EDNA FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO THE FIRE AND DID A COMMENDABLE JOB OF CONTROLLING THE FIRE AND PROTECTING LIVES AND PROPERTY. THERE WERE NO INJURIES DUE TO THE INCIDENT.

WHILE ENTERING THE TRAILER TO UNLOAD THE SECOND DRUM, THE BLADE ON THE FORKLIFT WAS ABOUT 3 INCHES FROM THE FLOOR AND PUNCTURED THE DRUM, MAKING A HOLE ABOUT 3 INCHES LONG AND 1 INCH WIDE IN THE BOTTOM OF DRUM.  THE DRUM BEGAN TO LEAK CONTENTS.  BOTH LEO AND I DECIDED TO FLIP THE DRUM OVER TO SALAVGE SOME OF THE CONTENTS IN THE DRUM.  WHILE LAYING THE DRUM ON IT'S SIDE, A LARGE STREAM OF THE LIQUID SQUIRTED OUT AND FELL ON MR. LONGORIA'S HEAD AND FACE.  HE BEGAN TO COMPLAIN OF A BURNING SENSATION ON HIS NOSE AND EYES, AND RAN TO THE BATHROOM TO RINSE HIS FACE.

AT THE TIME, I CALLED JOEL RAMOS, TERMINAL MANAGER OF THE DRT TERMINAL, AND EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT HAD HAPPEN.  HE TOLD ME TO REPORT BACK AFTER I FOUND OUT MORE ABOUT MR. LONGORIA'S SITUATUIN.   WHEN THE PARAMEDICS ARRIVED, THEY FLUSHED MR. LONGORIA'S FACE AND EYES WITH A SOLUTION AND DECIDED TO TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL FOR MORE OBSERVATIONS.  I THEN CALLED TOM KOHLBRECKER, PLANT MANAGER OF BASLER ELECTRIC IN PIEDRAS NEGRAS, MEXICO, AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT MR. LONGORIA HAD BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT AND WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL AND SOMEONE NEEDED TO TAKE OVER THE WAREHOUSE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED AND ASKED ME QUESTIONS ON THE CONTENTS OF THE DRUM.  THEN THEY NOTICED THAT ONLY 1 TO 1 1/2 GALLONS HAD SPLIT FROM THE TRAILER DOWN ONTO A PUDDLE OF WATER THAT HAD ACCUMILATED ON THE SLOPED DOCK AREA.  AFTER REMOVING THE DRUM, AND PLACING IT ON A CRADDLE THEY MADE OUT OF LUMBER, THEY ASKED TOM KOHLBRECKER TO PURCHASE SOME TO POUR OVER THE WATER/CHEMICAL MIXTURE AND TO CALL THE CITY OF EAGLE PASS TO GET INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW TO DISPOSE OF THE SOAKED UP MIXTURE.
