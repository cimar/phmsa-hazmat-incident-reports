When it rolled over the washout port cap located on the manhole loosened and started to leak.  The Fire Department/Hazmat response on scene had sand hauled in to contain the product that leaked into the ditch.  A state certified water agency came and drew the water out and brought that to a recylcing center.  We had another carrier & hazmat team come on sight and transfer the product into their trailer drawing out of the external valve and then the manway after the product level got low enough.  Trailer was uprighted and towed away.

Earl Kane was staging materials in preparation to load a curtain van trailer for a shipment. While moving a 300 gallon tote of Sodium Hydroxide Solution 50% with the fork lift, he turned a corner too quickly (he was traveling on a slightly downgraded slope), and the tote began to tip. He lowered the tote to the ground, but the tote still tipped over. The tote is constructed of two pieces: the outer plastic shell and the inner plastic bladder. The outer shell was undamaged by the fall, but the top of the inner shell cracked. The top of the tote fractured and the flowing material opened a hole about 18-24 inches in diameter in the top of the bladder.  Earl quickly turned the tote upright, but 250-275 gallons of material had  leaked out.    The material ran down the asphalt into open soil. Earl quickly covered the material and the soil with an absorbent material. BHS contacted the appropriate emergency response agencies, the NRC, the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality, and Environmental Management Solutions, to assist with the clean-up. BHS rented a mini-excavator and collected the contaminated soil and absorbent. The area was rinsed with a non-hazardous citric acid solution and the rinsates were combined with the collected soil and absorbent.    The soil, absorbent, and rinsates were collected in lined containment totes. BHS worked with Enviromental Management Solutions of Meridian, ID, during all of the clean up and remediation. The totes were taken for proper disposal at a certified waste treatment facility by Environmental Management Solutions.    The spill was completely contained to BHS property at 1717 E. Fargo Ave. The soil has since been replaced with fresh clean material.",BHS has determined that Earl Kane was traveling too rapidly on the fork lift.

While off loading the trailer, an employee noticed small amount of material on the floor of the van trailer.  He immediately notified his supervisor of the spill and an in house emergency response crew was dispatched to identify the source of release and to take all necessary corrective actions.  Upon review of the paperwork, the emergency response crew donned appropriate protective equipment and entered the trailer.  An inspection of the non-bulk packages in the trailer identified that a single 55-gallon UN 1A1 container of Division 6.1 solution experienced a small pinhole on the bottom of the drum.  The cause of the pinhole is unknown but possibly caused by a protruding nail of a pallet.  The response crew immediately used a chemically compatible absorbent material to contain approximately 2 gallons of liquid that was release to the floor of the trailer.   The leaking drum was placed in a suitable salvage drum and all of the absorbent was collected and placed into appropriate container for disposal at an approved hazardous waste management facility.  The released material was confined to the inside of the van trailer and no offsite impact occurred.","Our investigation determined that the cause of the incident was a small pinhole in the bottom portion of the drum possibly caused by protruding part of a pallet or other small sharp foreign object during the course of loading or transportation.

Of the original 50 gallons in the container at the time of pickup,  responding personnel were able to determine that approximately 0.5 gallons leaked from the container.        The leaking container was one of two that contained the same liquid, and upon inspection revealed a small but noticeable star-shaped indentation on the sidewall of the container, approximately 6 inches down from the top rim.  A thorough inspection of the container revealed several other areas where the paint was noticeably “bubbled.” This might be an indication that the container failed (corroded) from the inside.     At 16:50, approximately 10 minutes after the vehicle arrived at the facility from its pickup route, a Triumvirate employee noticed a small trickle of liquid coming from the side door of the bed of the truck.   The material appeared to have just begun to leak from the side of the truck and there was no evidence that the leak had begun prior to the vehicle arriving at the destination. A close inspection of the immediate road surface showed no evidence that the leak occurred before the vehicle parked.      An empty open-head container was placed directly under the leak to collect the dripping liquid, while at the same time two Triumvirate employees donned Level-B personal protective equipment and entered the vehicle to identify and address the leaking container.  Once inside the vehicle, the Triumvirate employees were able to quickly identify the container in question and immediately placed it into an 85 gallon “over-pack” salvage container. While the two employees worked to contain and clean up the spill in the back of the truck, other Triumvirate responders using appropriate clean up materials addressed the affected area beside the vehicle.  All of the spill response by-products were containerized for subsequent disposal.","For future shipments of this waste material, at the time of acceptance (pick up) Triumvirate employees will perform an even more thorough inspection of the shipping containers to identify before hand any potential container defects.  The “offeror” of the waste was notified of the situation and asked by Triumvirate to inspect their shipping container inventory for any potential defects.  Triumvirate also asked the offeror to re-evaluate their selection process for selecting proper shipping containers.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Triumvirate Environmental, Incorporated",US,

UTLX 204519 was carefully moved and isolated on the repair tracks in the railyard awaiting shipper contractor response, inspection and securement. On 3/07/07, shipper contract responders from RESCAR reported that all six manway bolts became loose when they began to tool tightened these securement bolts in the recommended pattern. Afterwards, the manway bolts were loosened and manway cover opened to inspect the outage level and the condition of the manway gasket. The manway gasket was deemed in good condition and the product outage was at 4 inches. The manway was closed and properly secured. Response was concluded prior to 1130 hrs. PST, 3/07/07.

Upon inspection of the bushings prior to loading, it was discovered that one bushing was leaking from a pipe/tube located at the top of the bushing that had previously been connected to a gauge or other piping. This pipe had been plugged and duct taped by the offeror prior to delivery to the Port Washington terminal. Since the pipe was a threaded pipe and screwed into the top of the bushing, it was decided that the appropriate corrective action would be to remove the pipe and replace it with a threaded plug. Plugs were purchased and installed in the bushings. While conducting these activities two other bushings began to leak before we could get the plugs installed.     On the date of the incident, the weather conditions in Port Washington were unseasonably warm and it appears that dielectric fluid contained in the bushings began to expand as the bushings warmed up sitting in the sun. This expansion caused the plugs that had been used to fail and a small amount of fluid began to leak from the bushings. It is estimated that less than 0.5 pounds of liquid were released. The area of the release was cleaned using diesel fuel and sampled in accordance with the EPA rules for PCB contaminated oil.",Tool kits are being put together by Veolia ES Industrial Services (offeror) for use by field crews when they go out to pick up the equipment which will contain wrenches and additional threaded plugs.

CELLUCCI,"DIRECTOR, TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",42 Longwater Drive,NORWELL,MA,02061,Carrier,"At approximately 3:00 pm on March 20, 2007 a van trailer stored at Clean Harbors Environmental Services 10-day in-transit storage yard located in El Dorado, AR experienced a minor release of hazardous waste material from a non-bulk package.  During a daily inspection, an employee at the location noticed small amount of material seeping through the van trailer floor.  He immediately notified his supervisor of the spill and an in house emergency response crew was dispatched to identify the source of release and to take all necessary corrective actions.  Upon review of the paperwork, the emergency response crew donned appropriate protective equipment and entered the trailer.  An inspection of the non-bulk packages in the trailer identified that a single 5-gallon UN 1A2 container of Class 3 Paint, appeared to have been damaged by the superimposed weight of other similar containers stacked on top of it.  The response crew immediately used a chemically compatible absorbent material to contain approximately 1gallon of liquid that was release to the floor of the trailer.   The leaking container was placed in a suitable salvage drum and all of the absorbent was collected and placed into appropriate container for disposal at an approved hazardous waste management facility.   Approximately one quart of material leaked through the floorboards of the van-trailer onto gravel and compacted dirt pad.  The contaminated area was excavated, the material placed into appropriate containers for disposal at an approved hazardous waste management facility.     The time frame from the initial notice of the spill until the drum was overpacked and the spill clean up was approximately 2 hours.  All of the released material was collected and no offsite impact occurred.",It appears that the superimposed weight of the containers loaded on top of the failed container caused the container to partially crush and release some of its contents.  The offerror of this shipment has been informed of this incident and proper preparation of hazardous materials for shipment will be addressed with the responsible personnel.,No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

Tank Car UTLX646672 rolled off the track structure and came to rest on its BL side at a 90 degree angle. A steady stream (3/4) of liquid began leaking out of the manway area onto the adjacent asphalt roadway and ballast media. CSX Management immediately implemented the corporation’s emergency response plan. A call was placed to Chemtrec (Report # 03192007004) and the shipper, Finnchem USA was notified of the release. CSX Hazardous Material Manager along with representatives from Hepaco Environmental were dispatched to the scene. Once on site attempts were made to contain the release by tightening the manway securement bolts/ nuts. While hazardous material responders were able to slow the leak to a fast drip they were unsuccessful at completely securing the container. A containment pool was placed under the manway area to collect the released material. Mideast Wrecking was contacted to re-rail the railcars. UTLX646672 was up righted and placed back onto its truck assemblies at 1920 hours. 400 gallons of Sodium Chlorate Solution was released from the railcar. One hundred (100) gallons impacted the asphalt roadway I ballast media and three hundred (300) gallons was collected in the containment pools. Due to the mechanical damage (train line, twisted stub sill and safety appliance) the railcar will require transfer of contents. Arrangements are currently being made to complete this process.

TILX 190003 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard for further inspection. An initial inspection by a BNSF hazardous material responder confirmed that product had leaked down both sides of the side shell. The source appeared to be from the connection between the manway nozzle and the manway cover. All eight manway securement bolts were tool tight. The manway gasket appeared inset at the 8-9 oclock position, possibly out of position. The shipper was notified to arrange for inspection and or replacement of the manway gasket. TILX 190003 which was not leaking product remained isolated in the railyard until repairs were accomplished. In the late afternoon on 3/1/07, TILX 190003 was reported leaking product from the manway cover and also at the 75 psi safety relief valve, an indication of an overfilled condition from product expansion. The ambient temperature was 80 degrees Containment was placed under TILX 190003 to catch any drippage off the side shell. The manway lid was opened and product was noted only 1-2 inches below the manway nozzle lip. The manway gasket appeared to be in good condition. A contractor was called to facilitate off-loading of the excess product into a tanker truck. Approximately 1100 gallons of product was transferred without incident and concluded by 2310 hrs. PDT, 3/1/07. Non-contaminated spillage that was captured in the containment receptacles was also transferred into the tanker truck. Afterwards, the manway cover was closed and properly secured.

Morrisville called it in.  Release came from tote serial # 97568. Valve handle on the bottom of the tote had been pysically removed and put on in a reverse fashion, probably by the customer so it would be easier to access while using a hose with quick connect fittings. This exposed the handle to other freight friction. When the Carteret material handler loaded another tote next to it they did not space them and rubbed the handle which caused it to open partially. I am supposing the bottom safety cap was not completely fastened and completely released sometime during transport releasing an unknown volume of material.

The shipment was loaded with various hazardous waste products with identification numbers UN1993, UN3175, UN2927 and UN3077. the container was sealed by the USCG and the cargo was transferred into another container under the supervision of the USCG the following day.  There was no evidence of any leaking cargo from the outside or the interior of the container.  Air samplings of the container were also made but the hazmat responder indicated that there were no readings which would have caused the officer to have problems.  I phoned the NRC but was told that if there was no release then there was no report requirement.  The San Juan office made a report based on their finding under the NRC # indicated on Page #1.",USCG inspectors shoud inspect with care.  It is good that they work in teams.  The second officer was able to work with the officer involved in the incident and get him to safety quickly.  Containers loaded with chemicals and are moving in a high ambient humid environment must be inspected carefully.

Trainmaster Mosley immediately isolated the area around the railcar and implemented the corporation's emergency response plan.  Chemtrec was notified (report number 03252007013) and the shipper, PCS Sales was informed of the release.  SWS First Response was contracted by CSX to respond and secure the railcar.  Once on site, SWS representatives found the cause of the release was due to a worn pressure relief device ""O"" ring. SWS attempted to remove the retainer plate from the pressure relief device, however was unsuccessful due to thread damage towards the top of the stem.  After loosening the retainer plate as much as possible they were able to rotate the worn ""O"" ring.  The retainer plate was then tightened back into position which secured the release.  The shipper, PCS Sales will apply for an FRA Movement Approval to forward the railcar to its nearby facility where the container will be de-pressurized.

The operator immediately moved the drums to a safe area and turned the drum on its side to stop the release.

While attempting the turn, he lost control of the tractor-cargo tank trailer, causing the tractor and tanker to rollover. Driver was taken to the hospital, but was treated and release.  Miami-Dade Police Department cited the truck driver for careless driving.  Shipper and carrier dispatched responders to the scene at 1425P.  Miami-Dade Hazmat (fire department) as well as Police Department at the scene, estimated 10 gallons of sodium hypochlorite had been lost, but leak was not continuous (tanker had a crack in the shell near the front end top of the tanker).  Shipper and carrier drove additional, good cargo tanker to scene, and proceeded to offload sodium hypochlorite product from damaged tanker to good tanker.  Once all product removed at 2320P, both tractor and tanker involved in accident towed from the scene.  Tanker was a total lost, and tractor has damages valued at three quarters its value.  At 2340P, Miami-Dade public responders complete an inspection of scene and proceed with any final clean-up of scene.  At 0030A police open east bound side of 116 Way.  At 0130A, response is terminated and 116 Way open in all directions as well as two gas stations near scene which public responders closed for precaution.  No means available here to attach photograph of damage to cargo tanker, in future maybe online incident report can add a field for photograph attachments.","Serious driver error.

As he came to the intersection, the light turned yellow and he applied the brakes hard. In doing so, the force of the stop caused material from the rear box to cascade over the top and spill on to the roadway. The driver remained stopped and called PSC dispatch for help. Northwood police and fire were on the site within 10 minutes and diverted traffic. The spill was contained to the the immediate area around the vehicle. No waterways or drains were affected.    Within 20 minutes of the incident, PSC responded and applied absorbents to the area and proceeded to clean up the roadway. All spilled material and absobents were placed back into the container from which the material originally spilled. The containers were then transported back to the generator for proper fixation.","All boxes at the generators site will be inspected for free liquids.

During the unloading of the sodium hypochlorite solution, the IBC cracked circumferentially at approximately the 305 gallon mark around half of the circumference of the IBC and then diagonally 3/4 of the way down the body of the IBC.  Approximately 165 gallons was transferred into an on site open top storage container.  After the product was completely unloaded from the IBC, the driver called the office to report the incident.  I left immediately and arrived on the scene at 09:45 hours.  The well house is situated on top of a slight hill and the hypochlorite had concentrated at the bottom of the hill near the bend in the gravel driveway.  I spread a dry dechlorinating product to neutralize the chlorine, and then contacted the National Response Center and Maryland Environmental Service's main office.  Maryland Environmental Service is contracted by the Town of La Plata to operate the Town's water and wastewater facilities.  The Town sent an equipment operator from the Public Works Department to the site with a backhoe to mix the soil with the dechlorinating product.  I continued to apply the dechlorinating product until the area did not register for residual chlorine.","The first thing Intercoastal Trading Inc did to prevent a recurrence was to immediately suspend the shipping of any IBC over five years old.  The IBC which failed was over seven years old and had been in hypochlorite solution service.   The five year limit was a conservative number based on a projected IBC lifespan of ten to fifteen years.  The only IBC Intercoastal Trading Inc uses is the heavy weight ultratainer as manufactured by Snyder Industries Inc of Lincoln, Nebraska.  This IBC is considered by some to be the most durable IBC available.  When this IBC was manufactured, it had a substantial pressure rating of 428 KPa.

He placed a pallet jack under the pallet of bags and ""pumped"" the handle a few times to bring pressure against the jack and pallet, thus expecting the jack to not move during transit. When he pulled into the customer site, there were some uneven surfaces and turns that caused some bumping of his trailer thus loosening the pallet jack hydraulic handle and allowing it to roll unobstructed into the drum of N-Propyl Alcohol. It made a large gash a few inches off the bottom of the drum which allowed the product to completely empty in a short amount of time.    When David proceeded to the back of the trailer, he smelled the product and upon opening the door and seeing the liquid, immediately went to his trailer spill kit and pulled the contents out to protect a storm drain and keep as much of the product contained as he could. At the same time the truck was opened, the customer was present and he contacted the Midvale Fire Dept. who responded and took over managing the spill.    David then contacted his Supervisor, Tim Daw who in turn notified his Manager, Bob Sollesvik who directed Tim to travel to the site and gather all pertinate information and advise status of the incident. Operations Manager Bob Sollesvik was in route on a travel trip to another satellite branch in S.E. Idaho but was able to contact Univar's environmental response company, ET Technologies to stand by for respone in the event there needed to be a storm drain clean up.    The Salt Lake County Health Department arrived on the scene to inspect and monitor the drain and once the cleanup was completed, advised that the storm drain was properly protected and there was not a need for a cleanup team to come to the site.    David Mumford and Tim Daw completed the cleanup of the absorbent material once the Midvale FD gave the ok to enter the spill scene. David and Tim swept up all absorbent material (absorbent pads & soda ash) into an 85gal poly recovery drum, properly labeled it then transported it to the Univar facility in Salt Lake City for proper processing. As the product was solvent in nature, all liquid was soaked up with spill pads and did not leave residue in the trailer that could potentially continue to leak in transit. For precautionary measures, the trailer was unloaded at the Univar Salt Lake City facility and then was taken to a wash rack for cleaning.","Upon review of the incident, it was determined that the driver had not had ""official"" load securement training. However, the week prior during a review of a load he was to take, he had communicated to his manager that all material handling devices, such as pallet jacks, drum dollies and hand carts must be secured to either the side walls of the trailer or under a pallet with ratchet straps to prevent movement within the trailer during transit. Driver has received his ""official"" load securement training and management has noted as a corrective action item on the Univar Incident Investigation Report, that all new hire drivers will not be allowed to take a solo load until they have completed all company mandated driver training.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA,US,

Car was not moving.  Further inspection by CR's Mechanical Superintendent R. Caparelli found the liquid valve was not completely closed.  Valve closed and leaked secured.  Further inspection by CR's A. Richter, Mgr. Risk, and REACT's R. Gould, found the closure plug for said valve was cross-threaded, and holding onto valve threads by merely 2-3 threads at the bottom of the plug.      Closure plug was removed, noting remenants of teflon-like material at various locations on the interior threads of the valve where the plug is applied.  Additionally, numerous flakes of a teflon-like material were surrounding the closed ball valve, prohibiting the valve from proper closure.    The foreign material was cleaned from the threads and ball, a liquid pipe dope was applied to the closure plug threads, allowing the plug to be adequately secured for transportation to original destination.

The tank had been cleaned and the piping disconnected.  Approximately 600 gallons of oil spilled from the tank discharge line connection onto the ground.        There were two tanks used for diesel storage on sites T8 and T9.  Both had been cleaned and degassed. Tank 9 was ready for service and was to be used to store fuel for Ritchie 3(CTG).  Tank 8 had been out service for ten years. Employees checked the drawing and concluded that tank 9 was lined up for service. There were no identifiable markings or tags on the fill lines for either tank. Only one of the fill lines had a hose connector for unloading fuel and the operators connected the tanker to that line and began off loading.  When they went to check the receiving tank, they noticed oil running out of tank 8.        US Environmental was contacted to respond to the oil spill.",The fill lines to tanks 8 and 9 have been properly labeled.  The fill valve for tank 8 has been removed and the line capped.

This multiple railcar shipment consisting of twenty gondolas was immediately setout of this train at Wishram, WA. The shipper was notified of this event and arranged for a contractor familiar with these types of shipments to inspect the 20 railcars and initiate appropriate securement corrections. This shipment was inspected the morning of 4/02/07. The contractor reported that the commodity inside the gondolas appeared intact. A small amount of binder cracking was noted at the commodity end slopes inside the gondolas. The contractor was also of the opinion that this binder cracking was insufficient to result in the release of commodity 'dust' during train movement and normal wind conditions. The shipper's contractor resprayed the commodity inside the gondolas with another coating of binder to prohibit any further 'dust' erosions. During this binder respray, it was noted that the ambient high winds were between 15 and 25 mph and no blow off of this commodity inside the gondolas was observed. After all 20 gondolas were resprayed, this shipment was released to proceed to its destination and it arrived at that destination without further incident.",BNSF and the shipper are working towards testing and adding protective coverings (tarpaulins) on future gondola shipments.,No,HOPPER,Rail hopper car for solid materials only,HOPPER R,Yes,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

As the driver was positioning the transportation unit for off loading the fuel, the driver turned too soon not allowing adequate space between the trailer and a metal pole protecting the fuel pump. The resulting impact caused a breach in the trailer resulting in the release of 1800 gallons of unleaded gasoline.     The resulting release caused initial contamination in and around the fueling station. Due to the location of the fueling area (up gradient), the fuel traveled down gradient from the release point and caused off site contamination to an adjacent business.

Product did not migrate beyond the diked area, or enter into any storm drains or waters of the state.  Inland Waters of Ohio of Cleveland, Ohio was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, Inland Waters of Ohio proceeded to use a vacuum truck to recover the free product and rain water from within the diked area.  Approximately 1,800 gallons of contaminated water were recovered.  Inland Waters of Ohio also applied absorbent blankets around the storage tank to catch any residual product, and placed absorbent pillows by the shutoff valve, which leads to the oil/water separator on the property.  Upon inspection of the oil/water separator, it was determined that the product did not enter the system or travel to the oil/water separator.  Bart Ray of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency was on scene during cleanup activity, and authorized cleanup actions and containment.  Inland Waters of Ohio continued to monitor the site, and swap out existing absorbent blankets and pillows until no further residual product remained.  Contaminated absorbent material was containerized into one (1) 55-gallon drum.  Disposal was coordinated direct by Inland Waters of Ohio in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since the release was accidental and occurred due to an overflow from the storage tank while offloading, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

NE,HURON,SD,57350,Carrier,"The Lake City Police Department investigated a report from the Goodhue County Sherriff’s Department that a southbound train was leaking a substance that smelled like ammonia. The officer confirmed the chemical leak as the train passed by and advised his dispatcher to call the railroad. The Canadian Pacific Railway & Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad were notified that the IC&E MSPKC-17 train, traveling south on the Canadian Pacific Railway’s River Subdivision Mainline Track, did indeed have a chemical leak. The train was stopped south of Lake City, MN and the crew was evacuated. Residents in the immediate area were evacuated and the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) was activated. As more information from the scene was relayed, forces were dispatched including local fire, emergency management, ambulance, law, IC&E Emergency Responders, CP Emergency Responders, MN Regional Haz-Mat Responders, MN State Responders and contract Haz-Mat responders. The contracted Haz-Mat team was able to seal the anhydrous ammonia tank car’s leak, which was found to be coming from the pressure relief valve, with an Emergency Response “Midland B” Capping Kit. After the leak had been sealed and the area determined to be safe the evacuation was lifted and the area cleared. Tank Car GATX 58261 was set out at the adjacent siding for trans-loading, investigation and repairs. Tran-loading of the remaining product was completed March 20, 2007 at 1400 hours. Investigation during the teardown process of the car’s relief valve revealed a complete fracture of the valve stem which adjusts and retains the relief pressure valve. In addition, the relieve valve’s spring, retainer and nuts were observed in the bottom of the car. A new complete certified pressure relief valve was installed on site by Rescar, who was contracted by CF Industries Inc.",The failure of the lading retention equipment which resulted in the unintentional release is currently being looked in to & investigated further by the shipper/ car ower.  Ensure test & inspection requirements comply with 179.15 & 180.407.  NOTE:  I am awaiting additional information to complete Part IV question # 32.

Upon arrival and inspection of the area, the Mgr noted product contained between the gauge of the rail on the hump lead from the east end of the Group 7 retarder to the top of the hump; approximately 1000 feet.     Inspection of the car by mechanical personnel revealed that AB compartment which contained approximately 50,000 pounds of product to be empty. The dump door was open, and there were rolling marks on both sides of the dump door operating mechanism.     Inspection of the Group 7 retarder by track, operating, and mechanical personnel revealed a low spot in the track creating insufficient clearance. As the car was being pulled through the retarder, the dump door operating rod caught on the retarder skates causing the dump door to roll open as the car was being pulled.     After determining cause of the release, track maintenance personnel were called in to make necessary repairs to the track. Clean-up personnel were called in to vacuum and recover the product. All product was placed on plastic and covered until proper disposal arrangements could be made.     On 3-13-07, the product was loaded into dump trucks and disposed of appropriately.   Additionally, due to electrical circuit problems created from the product. The track from the top of the hump to the beginning of the Group 7 retarder was power washed.

I have ask driver of incident and he does not recall what happened. Trooper Benton was on scene along with the county of Blair emergency services hazmat team and Sugar Run Spills. Our insurance company was contacted and sent consultants from Pittsburgh, Pa to oversee clean up.  There was a crack approximately 10 inches on passenger side top front of tanker and double bulk heads had failed releasing product slowly from fittings between bulk heads. These were plugged to keep product from exiting tanker. Blair County Oil had a tanker transfer product from tanker involved in accident to their tanker. The use of absorbent materials were used to contain the release along with pads and booms including small dam to contain release. Everyone involved worked diligently to keep product contamination to the environment at a minimum.  * Pictures are attached.","All drivers that are employed by Albright Oil, Inc have been trained of our driving policies and procedures. We do everything that is possible to make sure that drivers operate under the conditions of all policies pertaining to safety guidelines set forth by our company. I have addressed these issues again since the accident and will continue to do so.  As far as recommendations for improvement to the Hazardous Materials Transportation Industry beyond Albright Oil, Inc. Everyone in our Industry wants what anybody would want and that is to prosper and provide for their families to the best of their abilities. This was difficult enough prior to our nations loss on 9/11. You have to have your mind on the task at hand while involved with hazardous material more today then prior to 9/11 because of outside threats. The security plans in place by our company are a must so that we can protect our employees and our nation.  It is now that anyone dealing with hazardous materials has to be held at a higher standard and have even more on their minds when responsible for their cargo.

After removing the cover, it was observed that the packing gland nut to the gauging tube was loose and not secured as required. The loose packing gland nut which was determined to have caused the vapor leak. Coupled with the gauging device housing cover not properly securied, allowed the vapor to build up within the protective housing, which in turn fueled the fire. checked all valves and fittings for proper securement and found that the two threaded plugs to the liquid line and the plug to the vapor line, were not in a wrench tight condition.

The driver was coming to the end of the exit ramp, realized that he was going too fast to stop (with the heavy load), and tried to steer the truck through the traffic light. He made a quick right-hand turn. The truck was full of oil, and top-heavy. The driver appeared to hit the curb, causing the truck to roll over. The tank was crushed in this accident, causing the oil to escape through the top of the fill hatch. It leaked on the roadway for about 1.5 hours. We called Response Environmental, Inc., police, fire, DOT, and the Rescue. Booms were placed near the storm drains. A dump-truck full of sand and gravel were used to make a dam between the truck and the storm drains. The oil then puddled in the middle of the road. The Coast Guard was notified, and booms were placed in the water to collect the oil that did reach the storm drains.

The Airgas vehicle was en route to the Airgas Searcy, AR facility located at 2229 5. Benton Street, which is approximately 200 ft. northwest of the point of impact. While traveling along the aforementioned curve, the Airgas driver stated that he heard a series of loud “pops” or “bangs” and saw “a flame” behind the cab of the tractor he was driving. The Airgas driver proceeded to exit the vehicle as it was still moving in a northeast direction. The vehicle continued to travel off of BoothlBenton Street in a northeast direction toward Highway 67/167 where it struck a wire fence. The Airgas vehicle continued to travel in a northeast direction into a ditch that borders the west side of Highway 67/167. The vehicle continued to travel onto the southbound lane of Highway 67/167, where it came to a rest crossing both southbound lanes, facing a northeast direction. Vehicle two struck the Airgas vehicle toward the front end of the trailer  The Airgas vehicle (semi-trailer) was loaded with compressed gas cylinders which were secured to steel cylinder pallets via securement straps. Due to the collision impact, many cylinders were thrown out and away from the pallet trailer, including the cylinder cluster discussed in section III. The cylinder cluster in question consists of a steel frame onto which twelve DOT specification cylinders are secured (see attached photos). Each cylinder is connected to a manifold system located at the top of the cluster. Each cylinder is connected to the manifold through 3/8 in. stainless steel braided hose that contain a maximum working pressure of 3000 PSIG. Two of these hoses were sheered as a result of the accident, causing the entire contents (each cylinder) (gaseous nitrogen) to be released to atmosphere. Estimated release duration is 5 — 10 minutes. It is unknown what object caused the manifold to shear.",UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.

Vehicle #2, our tractor tanker loaded with gasoline, could not stop so he tried to avoid colliding with vehicle #1. Our tractor trailer began to slide and the front of our tractor collided with the left rear of vehicle #1. Our tanker overturned and came to rest on its right side in the median. Motor fuel was leaking out of the dome lids on top of the tanker. We tried to seal the dome lids but could not. The valves to pump off were on the side next to the ground so we could not pump the fuel out of the tanker. We called the county supervisor to bring dirt to dam both sides of the median so we could contain the motor fuel that was leaking out of the tanker. We called US Environmental Services to prepare the tanker to drill holes in it so we could off load the motor fuel. US Environmental prepared the tanker to unload the motor fuel from our tanker to another. The tanker was loaded with 8555 gallons of gasoline. 1540 gallons was released.",I feel that this release was handled in an effective manner to reduce the amount of release and to control the possibilities of further hazards and damages. We will continue to seek better ways to minimize the damages when incidents like this occur. We will continue our training in the areas of safe driving and the controlling of hazardous materials when incidents like this occur.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,130950,,US,

Tank car was located in the North Platte Yard at Yard One Track 308 at Mile Post 290.84 of the North Platte Terminal. Mr. O’Neil advised the tankcar was leaking continuously from the top at a rate of one gallon every five minutes. Mr. O’Neil stated the tankcar was moved to a concrete containment area and no waterways were affected nor any reported injuries or exposures. Mark Reimers, Regional Manager Chemical Transportation Safety, was notified and stated he would contact Kim Keeling to respond. State Regulatory Agency Notifications were made. At 5:25 PM, Keith Martin, Flint Hills Resources advised the product was an aviation gasoline and stated a repair team was en route to inspect the tankcar. At 05:27 PM, Kim Keeling, Manager Environmental Field Operations, reported he was on scene. At 06:34 PM, Keeling stated the leak was due to the liqLlid valve not being secured properly. He resealed the valve and repairs were completed. He also advised he placed seal number UPRR 1133 on the load. Mr. Keeling stated the released product had evaporated. On 3/26 Keeling inspected the car and found it to have seven pounds of pressure with no further leak. Since the valve had been removed the car needed to be inspection by a certified tank car techician. Ryun Vanbasler with AV Fuel (Shipper) at 734-663-6466 ext.304 arranged for Union Tank Car to come to North Platte to perform the inspection. On Thursday, April 5th, Union Tank. car arrived to perform the inspection. The tank car failed inspection and was deemed not certifiable, consequently it would require a transfer. On Monday 4/16 Mr. Keeling and Mr. Vanbasler decided to use a local Haz-Mat Team to do the tranfer. Haz-Mat Response and RMCAT placed bids on the transfer and a bid on cleaning and purging the tank car. Bids were given to AV Fuel for their handling. VanBasler located a tank car in Laramie WY to use for the transfer.

WENTZ,DANGEROUS GOODS COMPLIANCE,4333 AMON CARTER BLVD,FORT WORTH,TX,76155,Carrier,"At approximately 1.5 hours into the flight or around 22:20 Local time, a small explosion occurred in the cabin of the aircraft near seats 25-26A1B while enroute from EZE to MIA. Flight Attendants responded with Halon Extinguishers and PBEs per Emergency Procedures in their Flight Manuals however none of this equipment was actually used. Passengers interviewed from the area indicated that there were sparks followed by a flash and smoke. A small battery had exploded splattering debris on the overhead bins above seats 25-26A1B. The Captain responded to notification from a Flight Attendant. Upon his arrival in the Business Class section of the cabin where the explosion occurred the smoke had already cleared. The Captain and several of the Flight Attendants interviewed passengers and conducted a thorough search of the area that included the floor, seat pockets, under the seats and ceiling. The remnants of a battery were all that were found. The Captain collected the largest piece which he later reported appeared to be like a CR123 Lithium battery. He brought this piece of the battery to the cockpit and soon disposed of it in the cockpit trash hag.  A fragment of the exploding battery struck the passenger seated in seat 258 in the head burning the hair on the right side of her head near her ear lobe. She refused any medical treatment. None of the passengers who were interviewed would admit that the battery belonged to them. It is suspected that one of the passengers seated in seats 25-26A/B dropped the battery or moved it with their foot causing itto arch against a seat frame. The flight proceeded to MIA without further incident.  Upon arrival in MIA the seat bottom of 25A was replaced. Upon return to EZE, all seat covers on seats 25 A/B and 26A/B were replaced and the overhead bins were wiped down after photographs were taken. The seat covers were shipped to MIA where they were later turned over to the NTSB for testing for residue.","Increased public awareness such as what has begun at safctravel.dot.gov including TV, radio and newspaper ads is the key to ensuring safer travel with lithium and lithium-ion batteries.

The shipment was not labeled as a DG, nor did the AWB or manifest indicate a dangerous good or a special provision.  The manifest states that the HAWB 63889335 is motorcycle parts.

Transportation vehicle was traveling on a mountainous road (Route 10), and negotiating various turns on a downhill grade. After negotiating one turn the unit came to a straight-a-way and entered a left-hand turn. As the unit entered the turn, it met a vehicle traveling in the other lane of traffic. The Flying J Transportation driver kept the vehicle in the appropriate travel lane and negotiated the turn. As the driver came out of the turn, he checked his rearview mirrors and viewed the left rear tires of the trailer were three to four feet off of the road surface. The trailer then flipped to the right causing both tractor and trailer to overturn onto it side. The tractor and trailer slid and completely overturn and exited the road surface into the adjacent highway shoulder (culvert).   According the West Virginia State Police (WVSP), the Investigating Officer claims the following conclusion, ""As the vehicle was negotiating a curve, it partially exited the roadway on the east side. As the operator of the vehicle was bringing the vehicle back onto the roadway, he lost control of the same.” SEE CONTINUATION PAGE ATTACHED”","Due to the volume of fuel onboard, approximately 7300 gallons, and the various turns the driver was experiencing, the fuel in the trailer was under constant movement. A trailer transporting liquids will act differently depending upon the volume of fuel. Drivers will be retrained on the proper speeds while traveling on mountainous roadways. This will involve trailers while full, partially full and while empty.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,111340,PILOT TRAVEL CENTERS LLC,US,

Bob Schooley was a motorist on the overpass and had seen part of the accident as it was happening. He told me he had seen the truck as it was overturning and wanted to offer assistance. He drove his truck down the off ramp and went towards Terry to help get him away from the truck. He stated the truck had flames on the trailer before it hit the ground. Terry was out of the truck as he got there and heading towards him. He helped him across the off ramp and try to make Terry as comfortable as possible while waiting for emergency personnel. Terry asked him to call the office and his family.   Details were very vague when we started out, did not know Terry’s condition or the location of the accident. I asked a customer in the area to check on what she could as far as letting me know anything. We had bits and pieces of info as the afternoon progressed. I called DNR about 30 minutes after we first were notified, could have called  earlier but did not have enough information to answer any questions.   I spoke with Dean Lamb and began the process of reporting the accident. He assigned a claim number of 0703271350DAL. After taking all the information we had at the time he stated we had done everything we could at that point and would need to work with someone on clean up. Someone from DNR would be on site and tell us what to do and what would be required.   We followed news broadcasts and had information relayed back to us through out the evening. Wayne Schweigert had been in route to Perryville when the first calls came in, he went to the site as soon as he was notified. Wayne and Mark remained in the area until the DNR representative said the clean up procedures had been taken care. I came back to Ozora around 9 pm to assist in setting the tank and making arrangements to be able to unload the water and fuel from the clean up site.   Terry called in the next morning around 7, he was in the hospital and had his medical needs taken care of, but would be in the hospital for a few more days. Although he was in some pain, he sounded good, and had his normal sense of humor.    For more detail see Terry’s statement and police reports.","The driver of the Schweigert Brothers truck was not found at fault in this accident, it is not known at this time if anything on his part could have prevented the incident.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,287635,Schweigert Brothers Inc,US,

Transportation vehicle was traveling on a mountainous road (Route 10), andnegotiating various turns on a downhill grade. After negotiating one turn the unit came to astraight-a-way and entered a left-hand turn. As the unit entered the turn, it met a vehicletraveling in the other lane of traffic. The Flying J Transportation driver kept the vehicle inthe appropriate travel lane and negotiated the turn. As the driver came out of the turn, hechecked his rearview mirrors and viewed the left rear tires of the trailer were three to four feetoff of the road surface. The trailer then flipped to the right causing both tractor and trailer tooverturn onto it side. The tractor and trailer slid and completely overturn and exited the roadsurface into the adjacent highway shoulder (culvert).According the the West Virginia State Police (WVSP), the Investigating Officer claims thefollowing conclusion,""As the vehicle was negotiating a curve, it partially exited the roadway onthe east side. As the operator of the vehicle was bringing the vehicle back onto the roadway, helost control of the same"". ""SEE CONTINUATION PAGE ATTACHED""","Due to the volume of fuel onboard, approximately 7300 gallons, and the various turns the driverwas experiencing, the fuel in the the trailer was under constant movement. A trailertransporting liquids will act differently depending upon the volume of fuel. Drivers will beretrained on the proper speeds while traveling on mountainous roadways.

(dba Shelton Oil & Transport Co.) wrecked on  Interstate 26 near Exit 37 in Buncombe County, NC. The driver, Steve  Pilkington, died at the scene from trauma caused by the accident.  The tractor-tanker was hauling approximately 8500 gallons of gasoline. The load originated in Spartanburg, SC and was destine for 1-{aywood County, NC.  Evidence from the scene indicates that the truck was west-bound on 1-26 when it came into contact with the guardrail to the right of the driving lane. The truck then proceeded over the guardrail and rolled onto its side due to the slope of the grade adjacent to the roadway. Once on its side, some of the product escaped the tanker through holes caused by the wreck.  Subtracting the quantity of fuel recovered at the scene from the quantity of fuel loaded yields an estimated quantity of 2057 gallons that leaked from the tanker. The product infiltrated the soil at the crash site. The product did not spill into a water body or onto a shoreline. There is no witness or conclusive evidence indicating that any product entered a waterway. Similarly, there has never been an indication of this product on any shoreline.  Any product that would have entered the river would have traveled through a drainage pipe passing underneath the interstate. A grated inlet is connected to this drainage pipe on the side of the interstate where the accident took place. It should be noted that the grated inlet was immediately covered with an impermeable tarp by the EMS first responders to prevent product from entering  this drainagc pipe. This tarp stayed in place from immediately after the accident until the rernecliaion eflos were substantially complete.  As soon as the remaining product was unloaded off of the \\Tecked tmck and the truck removed from the site, rernediation efforts began to clean the crash site. This effort continued until the contaminated soils were removed and hauled to an appropriate landfill.",,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC306,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,246849,SHELTON OIL & TRANSPORT CO.,US,

This resulted in the release of approximately 203 gallons of Oxygen, refrigerated liquid from the cargo tank.     Had just completed filling the non-specification cryogenic cargo tank, HL 190 serial #12133 from the 6000 gallons stand tank, serial # 2037. Upon completing the fill he completed the documentation and proceeded to start to move the truck to the parking area not realizing that he had failed to disconnect the fill line. This resulted in damage, with no release, of the piping on the fill mechanism of the stand tank and damage to the fill connection and valve on the non-specification cargo tank which resulted in the release of the 203 gallons of Oxygen, refrigerated liquid, in the tank.     He heard a “pop” as he was starting to pull away and upon looking in his curb side mirror saw the cloud created by the escaping oxygen. He immediately stopped the truck, turned off the ignition and reported the incident to, Branch Logistics Manager. He immediately went to the scene and secured the area from vehicle and pedestrian traffic and instructed his Transportation Supervisor to contact the fire department.     The St. John’s Fire Department arrived at approximately 0746 hours. Fire department personnel evaluated the scene and upon finding that the release was onto a concrete surface and that the liquid was evaporating at a rapid rate determined that there was no further action necessary. At approximately 0801 hours they declared the scene secure and departed.",Driver has received appropriate disciplinary action for his failure to follow Apria Logistics Policy & Procedure #L208-070.
