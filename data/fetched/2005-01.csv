He stated that cans were in the middle of the road. Oben stated that a drunk driver ran him off the road and fled the scene. Once the authorities arrived, our driver was talcen by ambulance to North Arundel Hospital. The RSO was dispatched to the scene and our driver from the Delaware pharmacy was sent across the bridge to the scene of the accident.  The accident happened on Eastbound Route 50, just prior to the Cape St. Claire Exit. This location is in Annapolis, Maryland, Anne Arundel County.  Scene:  Our RSO arrived on the scene at 0600. He assessed the damage to the truck and to the ammo cans. He was told that a vial had come out of the lead viai shield. After about 15 minutes, he discovered what was left of the vial in the middie of the road. He began to survey the area and measured the surface at 40 mR/hr. The size of the contaminated area was approximately 100 ft. Matt began to follow the trail of contamination, which lead to our Seaford vehicle that had come across the Bay Bridge to the scene of the accident. The passenger side tires were reading about 50 mRJhr on the surface. (We assume the drIver ran over the vial in the road.) The trail of contamination ended at this vehicle. The vial that was crushed was an 8 mCi multidose vial of MA.A calibrated at 1400 on 1/1/05.  Matt began to match up cans to the shipping certificates. After doing so, he found that a can was missing. After Matt and James Parker, the Seaford driver continued to search the area, they found the magnet and the 2 placards that matched this can. No can was ever found. The vehicle involved in the accident was surveyed and no contamination was present. The State Police had the vehicle towed prior to 0720.  Sherry Miller, the pharmacy manager arrived on the scene around 0720 andshortly after this, Robert Nelson from MDE also arrived on the scene. Mr. Nelson had H.AZMAT decontaminate the surface of the road and the wheels of the Seaford vehicle. This was done with high-powered water sprayed on the surface, which washed the contamination into a designated area along Route 50’s median. The highway was shutdown during this process — which may have lasted 20 minutes. After this procedure, the Seaford vehicle was not reading at the surface and the roadway was reading approximately 2 m.Rtbr. We released the Seaford driver and the roadway was re-opened.  The remaining cans and the spill kit and contents, along with a brush from the HAZMAT team were removed from the scene by Sherry Miller and James Parker. James Parker removed cans that were intact and no contamination.. Sherry Miller took cans that were intact and the clean-up material.",,Yes,RAM CONTAINER,Type A container for radioactive materials,TYPE A,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,0,CARDINAL HEALTH,US,

A 55-gallon drum inside the sea land container was found to be damaged during transport releasing ore inside the sea-land container. The damage was to the bottom lip of the drum. It had been bent approximately 3 inches in length at the seam which allowed the seam to open up —1/4 inch allowing material to be released from the drum during transit. Follow up radiological surveys indicated contamination outside the sea- land container at levels below DOT 49cfr 173.443 limits for removable contamination. Based on the loose material found inside the sea-land and the indication of contamination found outside the sea-land container, MTW personnel determined this was a reportable event due to the potential loss of radioactive material from the sea land containers according to 49cfr171 b 2 ( . . .,or suspected radioactive contamination occurs involving a radioactive material.)   The shipment receiver (MTW) halted all shipments that were in transit from the shipper (refused receipt) until the apparent cause to the failure could be determined and assurances that similar conditions were not present in other shipments in route. The shipping company representatives flew in from South Africa to investigate the failure with the carrier company. The investigation was initiated to determine why the 55-gal drum’s integrity had been compromised. The shipper, to assess the potential loss of material during transit, initiated inspection and radiological surveys of the areas the sea-land had been during transit. The additional shipments (sea-land containers in route) that were currently halted were assessed to evaluate for similar failures. No radioactive material was identified to be loss/released based on these inspections.   The damaged drum was weighed at MTW to assess the potential loss of material. 12 pounds of material was identified to be the difference between the shipped weight and the final weight. The amount cf material on the floor inside the sea-land was estimated to be approximately 12 pounds, indicating little if any loss of material while in transit.   The shipper determined that the drum base seam was most likely damaged (bent) while or prior to loading. This damage was further degraded during transport allowing material to leak out the bottom of the drum to the interior of the sea-land container. This is supported by a reports provided by the shipper and professional engineering consultant (attached).","Based on a clear understanding of the potential cause and reasonable assurances that   contamination was not present on the remaining shipments, the receiver allowed the remaining sea-lands in transit to procedure to MTW. There were no additional failures experienced in the remaining shipments. The shipper is committed to review its loading and inspection procedures to assure this type of failures will not be experienced in future shipments.",No,RAM CONTAINER,Type A container for radioactive materials,TYPE A,No,,,,,ZZ,,43,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

DURING THIS SEPARATION, THE RAILCAR CONSIST IMPACTED THE LOCOMOTIVE CONSIST WITH CLOSED COUPLERS.  THE TRAIN CREW RECOUPLED THE TRAIN.  THE CONDUCTOR WAS IN PROCESS OF INSPECTING THE REMAINDER OF THE TRAIN WHEN HE ENCOUNTERED A CHEMICAL ODOR AT LINE 40 (GATX 75680).  THE CONDUCTOR IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE LOCOMOTIVE CONSIST, SETTING 18 HANDBRAKES ENROUTE.  THE CREW UNCOUPLED THE LOCOMOTIVE CONSIST AND OPERATED ENGINE LIGHT TO WESTWOOD WHERE THEY WERE MET BY WESTWOOD FD/EMS.  BOTH CONDUCTOR & ENGINEER WERE TAKEN TO LOCAL HOSPITAL COMPLAINING OF BACK PAIN FROM THE TRAIN RUN-IN.  THE CONDUCTOR WAS ALSO GIVEN OXYGEN OF CHEMICAL INHALATION EXPOSURE.  BOTH WERE TREATED & RELEASED.  THE COUNTY SHERIFF BEING NOTIFIED OF THIS INCIDENT, CLOSED TWO NEARBY HIGHWAYS (STATE ROUTE 44 & COUNTY ROAD A-21) IN CASE OF A POSSIBLE DERAILMENT WITH A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL LEAK.  TWO BNSF MECHANICAL/HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RESPONDERS ARRIVED & INSPECTED THE STANDING TRAIN CONSIST FINDING NO DERAILMENT.

The operator reported to terminal personnel that the trailer was repaired.  IMTT personnel had initiated loading methanol into the trailer after completing a series of pre-loading checks following the IMTT procedure and work instruction.  The trailer had current DOT testing information on the plate.  Upon transferring the methanol a leak developed at the ring clamp on the external valve on the pump-off line.  The transfer was terminated and the leak was contained using a bucket.  The 275 gallons of methanol was removed from the truck and stored on-site in tank MGD-2.  The product owner will test the product for quality and either re-sell or dispose. The emptied trailer departed the facility.,Carrier’s must use available technology to determine the adequacy of their equipment to transport hazardous materials and just not annually but after each lading system is manipulated for example during repairs or cleaning some/most operators remove bolt up gasketed fittings to facilitate cleaning or repairs but the trailer is not tested after re-assemble.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,870,IMTT-Bayonn,US,

The driver returned to the terminal and reported to terminal personnel that the trailer had been repaired.  IMTT personnel had initiated loading methanol into the trailer after completing a series of pre-loading checks following the IMTT procedure and work instruction.  The trailer had current DOT testing information on the plate.  Upon transferring the methanol the flanged connection on the internal valve was dripping.  The transfer was terminated and the leak was contained using  buckets.  The methanol was removed from the truck and stored on-site in tank MGD-2.  The product owner will test the product for quality and either re-sell or dispose. The emptied trailer departed the facility.",Carrier’s must use available technology to determine the adequacy of their equipment to transport hazardous materials and just not annually but after each lading system is manipulated for example during repair or cleaning some/most operators remove bolt up gasketed fittings to facilitate repairs or cleaning but the trailer is not tested after re-assemble.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,IMTT-Bayonne,US,

This resulted in the vehicle rolling over 180 degrees and coming to rest upside down. The remainder of the crew in convoy immediately dug trenches and filled them with chemical absorbent pads to contain the material that was leaking. The Supervisor in charge contacted the District Manager. He contacted our Environmental Department at the Weatherford Corporate office in Houston, TX. They dispatched HAZMAT response teams from ort Worth, TX and Texarkana, TX. The local fire Department (Troup, TX) and the Texas Department of Public Safety were called to the scene. A representative from Texas TNRCC was also dispatched to the scene. The chemical totes were still attached to the truck by straps. The straps were cut, the truck lifted off of the totes and each tote was righted. An inventory of all material was taken and compared to the manifest to determine spilled quantities. The contaminated soil was removed by the HAZMAT team (Highway 59 Hazmat, Texarkana, TX) and taken for disposal. The dirt and fence were replaced. The wrecked vehicle was towed back to its home District. All remaining chemicals were transported via truck to the originating district. No citations were issued at the site.",We will have the driver repeat Smith System defensive driving.

Upon unloading at the Port of Houston in La Porte, Texas, a leak was discovered coming from the 20 foot container box.  The Houston Fire Department responded to assess the site.  Upon arrival, the Houston Fire Department applied absorbent pads to the minimal free product on the affected asphalt.  Dow Chemical Company was contacted to discuss response actions.  Garner Environmental Services of Deer Park, Texas was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon inspection, it was determined that one (1) 55-gallon drum inside the container, had a small hole in the bottom of the drum, due to friction in transit.  Garner Environmental Services offloaded the container, and applied absorbent material to the free product.  Approximately 15 gallons of free product were released.  The majority of free product was contained inside the container, and approximately one gallon had released to the asphalt surface.  The damaged 55-gallon drum was overpacked, and left on site along with one (1) 55-gallon recovery drum which contained the spent absorbent material and PPE.  Dow Chemical Company will coordinate disposition/disposal of the two (2) recovery drums, per local, state, and federal regulations.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since the release was accidental, and occurred due to friction in transit, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

Since this action did not improve the efficiency of the loading operation, the driver relieved the vacuum in the tank by manually opening the travel valve on the top of the tank. At the completion of the loading operation, the driver failed to secure the travel valve before departing from the shipper’s location. The shipper also neglected to inspect the vehicle prior to releasing the driver. While in transit, material sprayed from the open travel valve and was reported by a motorist to the LA State Police. The LA State Police responded and pulled over the truck. It was at this time that additional material was released from the valve and impacted the State Police vehicle. The local fire department and EMS were dispatched to the scene along with a member of the LA State Police Hazardous Materials Unit. Two individuals were transported via ambulance to a local hosptial where they were treated and released for potential exposure to the flammable liquid.

Fuel spilled into the AST concrete containment; however, a missing plug for the containment allowed diesel fuel to migrate onto the gravel/asphalt parking area in the vicinity of the AST and into a grass-covered drainage ditch to the northwest AST. Store personnel notified the Billings Fire Department of the release. The Fire Department responded to the release and applied absorbent material to limit migration of the fuel. The incident was reported to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) and Issued incident #O5O11710Q8BWH. A backhoe was used to remove impacted soil and gravel to a depth of approximately 6-8 Inches from an approximately 15-foot by 5-foot area adjacent to the release point and a 5-foot by 6-foot area in the drainage ditch to the northwest of the release point. Absorbent materials were utilized to manually remove spilled diesel fuel from the asphalt portion of the parking area to the northwest of the AST containment. A vacuum truck was utiilzed to remove diesel fuel and water from the AST containment.

A dunnage pallet appeared to have been pushed into the drum by freight loaded behind it.  The result was a crease/dent in the roll ring on the drum and was seeping out around that area.     The drum was placed on its side and Lanxess was contacted via Chemtrec.  Instruction given to place drum in steel salvage drum and await disposition on the drum.  Minimum material was noticed on the trailer floor to which appeared to have evaporated.",The drums in question did have dunnage placed around them to protect them from damage.  The problem is that the freight loaded against the dunnage was pushed into the dunnage to hard which then pushed into the drums resulting in the damage.

The shipment of drums had been tendered to Jevic Transportation on pallets.  The drums were removed from the pallets and put on the floor to facilitate cargo capacity in the trailer.  The consignee would not accept the shipment unless it was on pallets, but they would allow the driver to put the drums onto pallets from their stock.      While rolling the drums onto the pallets, the driver came into contact with some residue on the side of a drum containing phosphoric acid solution.  The driver was wearing gloves at the time.  The material wet the gloves and the calf area of his pants legs.  He washed the affected areas of his skin and contacted the HazMat Department of his company.  He stated that he did not feel any ill effects at the time, and wished to continue on his route.    He called again from his next stop reporting that he feels some burning sensation to the affected areas of his legs.  The Jevic HazMat Department directed him to go to a nearby medical facility for evaluation and possible treatment.

Due to the slightly contaminated cover bag inside the new empty container, the shipping description used for the shipment was “Radioactive Material, excepted package-limited quantity of material, 7, UN2910, Limited Quantity.”  Around 1:45pm, enroute to CNS, the new empty container with the slightly radioactively contaminated bag bumped into the under part of an overpass bridge on 1-85 South at Exit 68 in China Grove, Rowan County, North Carolina. A 2 foot by 2 inch tear had been made into the empty container. Pictures of both the damaged container and minor scrapes on the bridge have been included.  Framatome ANP and CNS were notified. Framatome ANP came to China Grove and surveyed the top and outer sides and detected no contamination. The 2 foot by 2 in metal strip from the tear was also removed and determined to be clean. No contamination was on the top of the container where the tear was made. At no time were there any releases of radioactivity, radiation exposure or personnel injuries associated with this event. The tear was repaired.  The decision was made by the dispatcher and driver to notify NCDOT (Bridge Maintenance) so that damage to the bridge could be evaluated. NCDOT Bridge Maintenance and Duke Power Safety met at the site to measure the height of the bridge at the point of impact and to access the bridge for any damage. Other than minor scrapes along the metal beams of the bridge, there was no damage to the bridge.  The route that the driver was following was DOT approved for height and width of the load being transported. During the trip from Framatome to CNS, the truck was escorted in the front by another Duke Power vehicle. The escort vehicle had a pole attached to help with height determination. The escort vehicle did not detect a height problem when it went under the bridge. DOT approved the route for the load height of 15 foot 9 inches. The measured point of impact in the travel lane was 15 foot 11 inches. The information for the bridge provided from DOT statistics state that the bridge clearance was 16 foot 6 inches.  On 1/10/05, 8 am, Chuck Denny was made aware of the incident. On 1/10/05, 9:15 Miss  Jones, 1-800-424-8802, from the National Response Center was notified of the DOT incident it was stressed that no release was made. She issued the DOT Incident Number of 746648 for the DOT Incident.","An escort vehicle was used for the tractor trailer involved in this incident. However, even though the escort vehicle used a pole that was 4 inches longer than the height of the escorted vehicle, the escort vehicle did not detect the height constraint and the package on the escorted vehicle hit the underside of the bridge when passing underneath it. It is believed that the pole used on the escort vehicle bent slightly and did not indicate the height concern. In addition, it is believed that the trailer may have tilted slightly to one side making the height a couple of inches higher. In the future, the vehicle will increase the pole length to ensure that it will better reflect the height of the escorted vehicle. The escort vehicle is also evaluating a pole that will electronically signal the escort vehicle driver if the pole hits anything.  NCDOT records indicate that the bridge had vertical clearance 16 foot 6 inches. This is 7 inches over the vertical height of point of impact, 15 foot 11 inches. We are now aware of how much the bridges recorded clearances can be off.",No,RAM CONTAINER,Lead container used as shielding for inner container of radioactive materials,CONT LD,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,13000,,US,
