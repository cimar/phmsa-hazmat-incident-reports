A road driver had dropped this trailer at a relay yard when he noticed the material leaking from the bottom of the trailer. We contacted Haz-Mat One and had a team sent to clean up the spill and over pack the damaged drum.",Proper blocking and bracing and not loading the heavy freight on top of the drums would have prevented this spill.

When the driver arrived to pick up the trailer it was parked under the loading rack.  The driver hooked up to the trailer, but failed to go on top of teh loading rack to inspect trailer.  Once the driver left the plant he stopped and climbed on top of the trailer to insure all valves and domes were secure.  Because it was snowing, the driver did not feel it was safe to climb down the walkawy on top of the trailer.  The driver returned to his truck, and continued on I-85.  After mergin on I-26, the driver had to brake due to other traffic.  The driver noticed product coming out of the front dome of the trailer when he hit his brakes.  The driver pulled over to the side of of the road and noticed a small amount of product on the side of teh trailer.  He also noticed that the front dome wa not secure, and the product was leaking past the gasket and down the side of the trailer.  The driver then proceeded to the nearest exit and called dispatch.  Dispatch notified Rhodia, and they both proceeded to teh scene.  Upon arrival they bagan the clean up process, but ended up calling out Advanced Environmental Option, Inc. to survey the spill and condust the actual clean up.  After the product was cleaned from the ground, the trailer was brought to a tank wash to finish the final cleanup of the trailer.

Washington, WI. Approximately one gallon of solvent leaked through the top bung of the drum and spilled onto the floor of the trailer. The trailer was equipped with a steel spill pan which prevented the material to be released to the environment. The container was placed into a salvage drum and the spilled solvent was cleaned up and shipped with the original container to the final TSDF for proper disposal.

When driver got to the consignee to make delivery, he was having problems getting the product to transfer.  There was frozen product in the elbow between the internal and external valve.  An attempt was made by the customer to heat the product in the elbow with hot water and steam.  That did not work.  The unloader had mentioned that sometimes when product freezes in the valve, they take the external valve off to get the hot water closer to the internal to melt any plug that might be in there.  When the unloader went to get his supervisor, the driver removed the external valve and used the steam and water to free the blockage.  At that time the internal valve indicator appeared to show the valve closed.  The plug of product became free and fell out of the elbow.  The internal valve failed to operate properly and the driver was unable to close it even with the emergency shut off valve. The driver was unable to replace the external valve because of the product flowing from the trailer. The product flowed on to blacktop, and into gravel and clay areas under tanks and pipes. Once on the ground, the product froze.  We contacted Hulcher Services to clean up the spill.",The driver acted against company policy when he removed the external valve on a loaded cargo tank.

The spill on the side of the road was cleaned up by the fire department.,"The cargo tank was tested when it was empty and passed the internal and external test.  The shop did find that the insulation in the trailer was saturated which caused the drip.  Not sure where it came from.

The trailer was positioned on an incline in the receiving dock. When the trailer door was opened it was discovered a 55 gallon drum of hazardous materials (Compound Cleaning contains phosphoric acid, 8, NA1760, PGIII) was leaking in the trailer.  Cardinal Health instructed the MFS Driver to pull out of the dock and SET Environmental was contacted to clean up the chemical spill which was still contained inside the trailer.  During the clean up process it was determined the chemical spill/leakage was caused by a puncture hole located near the bottom of the 55 gallon drum from another pallet which had an exposed nail on the end of the middle wooden stringer.  SET Environmental - 450 Sumac Road - Wheeling, IL 60090 - (847) 537-9221 performed the clean up and disposal of the hazardous material spill.","A meeting was held with all the MFS Dock personnel regarding proper handling and loading procedures of hazardous materials.

THE DRIVER APPLIED THE BRAKES TO KEEP FROM HITTING THE VEHICLE. HE DID HIT THE VEHICLE WITH MINOR DAMAGE TO BOTH VEHICLES. A COBB COUNTY POLICE OFFICER WAS IN THE AREA AND SAW THE INCIDENT HOWEVER HE LEFT THE SCENE WITHOUT REPORTING IT. THE OTHER VEHICLE THEN LEFT THE SCENE AND LEFT FALSE INFORMATION WITH THE DRIVER. THE DRIVER THEN PROCEEDED TO MOUNT PARAN CHURCH WHICH WAS ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE ACCIDNET. WHEN ONSITE THE DRIVER CHECKED THE LOAD AND NOTICED A LEAK FROM THE IBC. AT THIS TIME THE DRIVER CONTACTED THE SUPERVISOR AND A HAZAT TEAM WAS DISPATCHED. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. ALL STORM DRAINS WERE BLOCKED TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION. THE TRUCK WAS PARKED IN A CONSTRUCTION SITE AT THE CHURCH. THE SCENE WAS SECURED BY THE ATLANTA FIRE DEPARTMENT UNTIL THE GREENLEAF HAZMAT TEAM ARRIVED. ONCE THE TEAM ARRIVED MEASURES WERE TAKEN TO MITIGATE ANY FURTHER CONTAMINATION. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE EPA THE MOUNT PARAN ROAD WAS CLOSED UNTIL THE MATERIAL WAS CLEANED UP. THE MATERIAL WAS ABOUT A FOOT WIDE AND APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET IN LENGTH. OIL DRY AND LIME WERE UTILIZED TO NEUTRALIZE AND CLEAN UP THE SPILL. THE ROAD WAS SHUT DOWN FOR AROUND THREE HOURS AFTER WHICH OUR EFFORTS WERE CONCENTRATED ON THE TRUCK. TRANSFER OF THE REMAINING ACID WAS PUMPED INTO ANOTHER CONTAINER. THE TRUCK BED WAS THEN DECONTAMINATED WITH LIME AND OIL DRY. ONCE THE TRUCK WAS SECURE IT WAS MOVED SO THAT REMEDIATION OF THE SITE COULD BEGIN. THE SAME DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURE WAS UTILIZED FOR THE REMEDIATION AND SOME DIRT WITH GRAVEL WAS ALSO REMOVED. A ROLLOFF CONTAINER WAS UTILIZED FOR THE MATERIAL AND IT WAS THEN PROPERLY DISPOSED AFTER ANALYTICAL WAS COMPLETE.,THE COMPANY IS NOW ADDING E TRACKING TO ALL THE TRAILERS AND BOX TRUCKS.

CST, 2/14/06. On 2/15/06, this container was noticed leaking an unknown substance from the container’s rear doors while it was being moved from the parking lot area to the trackside ramp area. OOLU 342864 was immediately taken to the intermodal containment area for further investigation. BNSF contract responders placed plastic sheeting around OOLU 342864 to catch spillage prior to opening this container. Inside, responders found double stacked/layered BC’s (plastic innards surrounded by metal cages) with no layer separators used. One top layer IBC has shifted during non-rail transportation. The extended metal lower foot and the boftom area of the cage (used for forklift tine insertion and support) of this shifted IBC had fallen into the top unprotected portion of the IBC below it, causing partial crushing and a cut in the plastic innards. All IBC’s were removed from the container and wiped down with acid pads. The inside of OOLU 342864 was pressure washed. The rinse water was collected and placed inside a new IBC. Approximately 7 gallons of the released product impacted the ground soil and this impacted Soil was excavated and placed into poly overpacks for future disposal. The remaining product in the damaged IBC was transferred into a similar IBC. The damaged IBC was washed and rinsed and held for future disposal along with all other clean-up material. All non-damaged IBC’s were returned to OOLU 342864 appropriately blocked and braced for export. Response concluded at 1600 hrs.

Due to the impact, the tractor’s passenger side diesel fuel tank ruptured, and sparks from the impact ignited the diesel fuel. The ensuing fire caught the tractor on fire, which destroyed the unit. The cargo trailer containing 9000 gallons of gasoline did not rupture or ignite due to the fire. However, the trailer did receive structural and heat damage.    Due to the type of cargo, public safety official closed the freeway in the event of an explosion.  A private response company was hired to remediate any remaining diesel fuel from the road surface and transfer the cargo from the damaged tank into a second tanker provided by Flying J Transportation. Upon completion of the transfer operation, the freeway was reopened.","At this time, the cause of the crash is undetermined. One witness to the incident stated that he saw the driver asleep at the wheel. However, due to the time of the incident, it would be hard to make such a determination. Due to this claim and other safety factors, Flying J Transportation has implemented the below detailed instructions.    Flying J Transportation has instructed all drivers to remain concentrated on the whereabouts of their vehicle during any type of movement. They are prohibited from using cellular phones, coffee thermos or any other type of object, which could cause a distraction in the cab.

Our trip number 06-0338.     Saturday evening approximately 5PM the driver noticed a very strong odor coming from trailer as he was stopped in Rawlins, Wy. he initially couldn’t see any leaking but the odor was too strong for him to enter the trailer to determine the cause. He called the number on the Manifest to Onyx at the origin, he was told this wasn’t the correct number to call but they would have someone return his call (no one did) He next called me on our emergency pager, we talked about the problem and I instructed him to call the emergency response number listed on the manifest, he was put in touch with Sean at Onyx to discuss the situation and course of action they wanted us to pursue. Sean asked if he felt the truck could continue to their facility and the problem could be corrected there. Per our earlier conversation Oscar said he didn’t feel comfortable doing that. Sean (Onyx) then decided to call out a responder. They chose to use RM Katt out of Denver,Co. Upon entering the trailer and examining the containers it was determined that two of the large metal totes had been over filled by the generator (Intel Corp, Hillsboro, Or) which did not allow for expansion due to elevations changes, The manifest number was 05013, the waste was (acetone) Katt completed the clean up as best they could and vented all the totes in hopes for prevent more over-flow, but they couldn’t rule out that this might continue during the remainder of the trip (Rawlin’s to Henderson) The driver checked again in Cheyenne, there was a little suspect venting but after a discussion with Sean at Onyx it was decided the truck should proceed to Henderson and Sean would make the necessary arrangements if any follow-up was needed.    This morning Monday 5/13106 Oscar made the final delivery without any further incident.    Please forward this to Insurance Company who should assign it a claim number.    Thanks for your help.
