THE CONTENTS OF THE TRAILER WERE: * 4-650 LB. DRUMS OF 50% CAUSTIC SODA * 2-200 LB. DRUMS OF SULFURIC ACID * 2-110 LB. DRUM OF POTASSIUM PERMANGANATE * 50-25 LB. BAGS FO FILTER POWDER * 224-100 LB. BAGS OF SODIUM SESQUICARBONATE * 1-650 LB. DRUM OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE * 12-150 LB. CYLINDERS OF LIQUID CHLORINE SEGREGATION OF PRODUCTS AND PLACARDING WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH DOT REGULATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY IS PRIMARILY PER AN INTERVIEW WITH THE DRIVER: THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ABOUT 1.5 MILES FROM THE PLANT ON THE LOOP 12 OVERPASS CROSSING THE TRINITY RIVER.  AT ABOUT THE TIME THE TRUCK CRESTED THE OVERPASS, NORTHBOUND, (1) THE DRIVER SMELLED CHLORINE, (2) A PASSING MOTORIST STARTED HONKING HIS HORN AND MOTIONING TOWARD THE TRAILER AND (3) THE DRIVER LOOKED IN HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR AND SAW A CLOUD OF GREEN GAS COMING FROM THE TRAILER.  HE IMMEDIATELY PULLED ONTO THE SHOULDER, STOPPED, GOT OUT OF THE TRACTOR AND MOVED ABOUT 50 YARDS FROM THE TRUCK, AS THERE WAS STILL A STRONG SMELL OF CHLORINE.  A TRININTY RIVER AUTHORITY EMPLOYEE WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH CHLORINE STOPPED TO ASSIST.  HE TOOK OUR DRIVER TO THE BOTTOM OF THE OVERPASS.  APPARENTLY, A PASSING MOTORIST HAD NOTIFIED THE AUTHORITIES.  THERE WERE SEVERAL AMBULANCES AT THAT POINT. THEY WERE TAKING PEOPLE WHO HAD DRIVEN THROUGH THE CLOUD TO THE HOSPITAL AND RELEASED.  THE DRIVER RETURNED TO THE VICININTY OF THE TRUCK UPON ARRIVAL OF THE HARCROS EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM. THIS BASICALLY CONCLUDES THE DRIVER'S STATEMENT. THE PLANT WAS NOTIFIED OF THE PROBLEM AT ABOUT 12:20 PM BY THE IRVING HAZMAT TEAM.  WE HAD OUR CHLOREP TEAM ON SITE BY 23:35 PM WITH THEIR EQUIPMENT AND A DRIVER, TRUCK AND PICKUP.  OUR PRIMARY CONTRACT AT THE SCENE WAS CHIEF BASSINGER OF THE CITY OF IRVING FIRE DEPARTMENT. HAZMAT PERSONNEL WERE BRIEFED ON THE CONTENTS OF THE TRAILER, LOCATION OF THE VARIOUS PRODUCTS, POTENTIAL HAZARDS, ETC.  I INFORMED THE HAZMAT PERSONNEL AND CHIEF BASSINGER THAT WE WERE CHLOREP TRAINED AND CERTIFIED, AS WELL AS FULLY EQUIPPED TO HANDLE ANY CHLORINE EMERGENCY. HAZMAT WAS NOT ALLOWING ANYONE WITHIN 150-200 YARDS OF THE TRUCK.  THEY DECLINED TO ALLOW US TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM AT THAT TIME.  RATHER THEY DID THE FOLLOWING: 1)SET UP AN EMERGENCY SHOWER/DECONTAMINATION STATION ALONG WITH SPILL CONTAINMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY, 2) MAINTAIN A BARRICADE DISTANCE OF 150-200 YARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND 3) SEND TWO HAZMAT PERSONNEL TO OPEN THE TRAILER.  THESE PERSONNEL WERE EQUIPPED WITH SCBA'S, ENCAPSULATING SUITS AND TWO WAY RADIOS. UPON THEIR RETURN, WE WERE PERMITTED TO GO TO AND ENTER THE TRAILER.  TWO UNRELATED PROBLEMS WERE FOUND: (1) A 150 LB. CHLORINE CYLINDER HAD DEVELOPED A BOTTOM LEAK AND WAS ESSENTIALLY EMPTY, (2) A 200 LB SULFURIC ACID POLY DRUM HAD A HAIR LINE CRACK ABOUT 1/2"" LONG AND HAD SPILLED 2-3 LBS OF ACID ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER.

THE CONTAINER WAS THE UPPER CONTAINER ON DOUBLE STACK FLAT CAR, DTTX 62437.  THE CONTAINER WAS LOADED WITWH TWO TYPES OF HAZARDOUS FREIGHT, (50) 55 GAL DRUMS OF CORROSIVE LIQUID NOS (POLYOXYPROPYLENDIAMINE) AND (8) 55 GAL DRUMS OF POISON LIQUID NOS (CHROMATE).  THE CONTAINER WAS ALSO LOADED WITH 5833 LBS OF NON-HAZARDOUS SYNTHETIC RESIN, WHICH WAS SHRINK WRAPPED ON 5 PALLETS.  THE LADING WAS LOADED IN THREE SECTION.  THE REAR SECTION CONTAINED 26 DRUMS OF THE CORROSIVE MATERIAL, SINGLE DECK.  THE MIDDLE SECTION WAS THE 5 PALLETS OF SYNTHETIC RESIN.  THE FORWARD SECTION WAS SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE LOAD WITH PLYWOOD, ROOF TO DECK AND WAS DOUBLE STACKED WITH 24 DRUMS OF CORROSIVE MATERIAL AND 8 PALLETIZED DRUMS OF THE POISON LIQUID NOS.  IN THIS FORWARD SECTION, WE FOUND 2 DRUMS OF THE CORROSIVE LIQUID, NOS THAT SHOWED SIGNS OF LEAKAGE FROM THE BOTTOM CHIME.  THIS APPEARED TO BE CAUSED BY FRICTION AND RUBBING WITH THE PALLETS OF POISONOUS LIQUID NOS.  THESE TWO DRUMS WERE OVERPACKED IN 85 GALLON METAL OVERPACK DRUMS AND RELEASED WITH THE SHIPMENT.  WASTE THAT WAS GENERATED WAS MANIFESTED OUT ON CA. UNIFORM HAZARDOUS WASTE MANIFEST #91601783.  THIS LOAD WAS NOT LOADED NOR BLOCKED & BRACED PROPERLY AS SPECIFIED IN CFR 49, SEC 174.55.
