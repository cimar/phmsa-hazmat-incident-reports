As he was inside of the trailer (approx 8ft), he was unable to have a line of sight to the customer tank.An employee of the customer quickly notified the driver that the 2"" hose had come out of the tank and sprayed another employee with phosphoric acid 75% on his right side, including some in his eye.The customers other employee's in the area immediately responded to bring the effected employee to a safety shower. The driver immediately shut off the air and assisted the exposed employee while he was in the safety shower (keeping him there for 20+minutes). After employee was rinsed sufficiently, the customers Operations Manager took him to a local clinic for treatment. The local clinic recommended that he should see an eye specialist. The employee returned to work 2-3hrs later to gather his belongings and was taken to a eye specialist, treated and released home. Employee returned to work the next morning at full duty status with only minor eye irritation.     The remaining product that had sprayed the transfer area was completely contained and cleaned up in-house. All residual material was flushed to the neutralization pit for treatment prior to discharge. The transfer area where the customer tank is stationed is completely bermed and contained. Estimated amount of product spilled was 8 gallons.","Customer and Carrier Incident Investigation found the following corrective actions necessary for a safe off loading operation.  1. Driver did not secure the discharge hose to tank. Corrective Action: Carrier has installed camlock fittings to tank and provided driver with securement training.  2. Customer did not provide 2nd man at the tank to assist carrier driver. This was an agreed to procedure with the customer from the carrier at the initial managers delivery survey. Corrective Action: Customer will ALWAYS provide a 2nd man, fully suited in proper corrosive PPE prior to carrier discharging product. Carrier drivers have been instructed to discontinue the transfer process if the customers employee leaves the transfer area.",No,IBC,"For liquids, when stacked",31H1,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA,US,

The driver and customer had put buckets under all connections as a precaution prior to beginning the unload unfortunately the product leaked down and missed the bucket.

The unloader did not shut off the drumming nozzle quickly enough on one of the totes as it filled up causing an overflow of 4 liquid gallons.,Operator error by the consignee who was working the drumming nozzle resulted in the spill.  Recommendations would be for our driver to run his product pump at a slower rate and to communicate better with the unloaders as the totes are nearing the full mark to be better prepared to either slow the flow of product down even further or to shut off the flow up product using the product pump to help prevent future incidents such as this.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

CELLUCCI,"DIRECTOR, TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",42 Longwater Drive,NORWELL,MA,02061,Carrier,"At approximately 7:00 am on June 9, 2006 a spill ocured in the trailer that was being backed up to an unloading dock at a fully contained yard of Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc, facility located at 2815 Old Greenbrier Pike, Greenbrier, TN.  The vehicle was being backed into a containment dike in order for the load to be transfered to an awaiting trailer.  Upon opening the rear compartment of the vehicle, the dock personnel noticed a tipped over 55 gallon container leaking material onto the trailer floor.    They immediately notified their supervisor of the incident, retrieved the shipping papers to review the contents of the vehicle.  It was determined that this shipment only contained materials from Toray Fluorofibers America Inc, picked up the day before.  In order to destribute the weight evenly over the  length of the trailer, the cargo was split into two distinct areas of the trailer.  The material was  secured by utilizing numerous load locking devises.  During the backing up operation, the vehicle went over a containment barrier, and the resulting movement to the trailer caused one of  the load bracing devices to dislodge and one 55 gallon drum containing Class 8 corrosive material to tip over and fall off a pallet.  The fall of the drum resulted in a failure of a closing device which resulted in a loss of that drum's content.      After the verification of the material, an in-house clean up crew donned appropriate personal protective equipment and entered the material hauling portion of the vehicle.  The drum was uprighted and the spilled liquid was cleaned up utilizing compatible absorbent material.  All of the absorbent material used to clean up the spill was collected and placed into appropriate drums for disposal at a fully licensed waste management facility.  Approximately 50 gallons of material was spilled inside the transport vehicle, about one quart of material seeped through the floor boards of the trailer onto a fully contained concreet dike, which was also cleaned up utilizing appropriate methods.  The time frame from the initial notice of the spill until the drum was uprighted and the spill cleaned up was approximately 2 to 3 hours.  Please note that during the release and until the clean up operation was complete, the vehicle was parked in a fully contained concrete dike.  All of the spilled material was contained and no offfsite impact occurred .",Our investigation determined that the cause of the incident was impropper load securement and subsiquent movement over the berm of the containment.  The individual responsible for loading and securing this load will receive additional training on proper cargo securement.  In addition the load securement devices used during this incident will be reviewed for defects and replaced if necessary.  The company policy regarding splitting the cargo will be reviewed for effectiveness and amended as needed to mitigate another occurrence of such incident.,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

If there is no drop in air pressure it is sealed and deemed ready for shipment.  The driver is not to open domes after they are sealed and pressured checked.  The driver can then visually observe the gasket after unload is complete and some of the domes are opened up to rinse out any residue.  Rear dome gasket started leaking very slowly after tank was pumped liquid full and pressured up to circulate customer water solution through cargo tank during blending process.  Trailer dome gaskets passed the air pressure test performed by loading operator.","The manager had our mechanic inspect the domes of each cargo tank in terminal parking area and found numerous questionable gaskets.  Replacement gaskets are being ordered and installed as quickly as possible.  Based on results of this inspection, Sentinel will initiate a periodic dome gasket check on the cargo tanks.  The manager will train all drivers to insure each one has the ability to recognize a serviceable gasket versus one that has started to deteriorate and needs to be replaced to prevent a possible problem  The employees of the Carlin terminal will develop a system to insure that any questionable gasket noted by driver after unloading are reported so they can be repaired-replaced prior to reloading of the trailer.    We are requesting a technical review of gasket material currently specified to determine if it is still the best choice for this application with the maximum durability.  We are also requesting a joint review of the current procedure to pressure test the cargo tanks after loading to determine if the air pressure limits and the observation time is adequate.  Review could also explore any newer technologies that could help detect small air leaks that might be missed in current process but would indicate a likely leak after the cargo tank is filled liquid full and pressurized at customer site.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,SENTINEL TRANSPORTATION LLC,US,

One was a single banded piece and the other consisted of 15 loose boxes. The shipment traveled on DL flight 149/27MAY06 to JFK then connected via truck to CLE. As agent in CLE was preparing to release shipment to customer they noticed Class 3, Flammable Liquid labels on several packages. The agent refused to release shipment and notified their supervisor. CLE notified DL's Corporate DG group (DGMG) via our internal notification system. DGMG advised CLE to quarantine the shipment and notify the local FAA Regional Office. FAA Special Agent Stevens visited CLE on June 5, 2006 to review the shipment, take pictures, and advised CLE they would handle moving forward. Once Agent Stevens completed the investigation the shipment was authorised for release. It has come to the attention of DGMG that the Flammable Liquid labels may have been added to the shipment in an attempt to get the shipper in trouble. This has not yet been confirmed, but is being investigated by Delta Air Lines.","It is believed that the shipment was not a hazardous material and that the labels were placed on the package after tender to DL for transportation. As stated earlier, it is believed that another shipper or someone in conjunction with transport of this shipment placed the labels on the packages. Delta is conducting an internal investigiation into the event.

While exiting the Gilford Rail Terminal in N. Billerica, Massachusetts, a leak was discovered from the cargo tanker.  Apparently, a valve was left open on the tank, which resulted in the release of approximately 19 gallons of ferric chloride.  Originally, the release was reported to have involved approximately 80 gallons of free product.  However, after further inspection of the tanker, it was determined that approximately 19 gallons of ferric chloride were released.  The ferric chloride released to the asphalt surface within the roadway.  No soil or waters of the state were affected by the release.  The Massachusetts Department of Public Works responded to contain the free product with the application of sand to the affected roadway.  The N. Billerica Fire Department also responded and applied lime to neutralize the free product.  TMC Services, Inc. of Bellingham, Massachusetts was dispatched to perform the remainder of cleanup.  TMC Services, Inc. recovered the spent sand and neutralized product, which was containerized into eighteen (18) 55-gallon drums.  Disposal was coordinated per local, state, and federal regulations.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be related to an open valve on the cargo tanker, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

Box 20706,ATLANTA,GA,30320,Carrier,"On Sunday June 18, 2006, CVG cargo received a truck of freight from ORD for international export. On the truck was AWB 006-4963-1562, 22 pieces to AMS. There shipment consisted of 12 skids, 8 boxes, and 1 crate. CVG cargo received 21 of 22 pieces and signed off the truck as being 1 piece short. Shortly after arrival, ATS Supervisor Roy DAvis in CVG, alerted CVG cargo of the undeclared DG finding. AS ATS, DL's cargo handler in CVG, were building pallets of the freight, which had arrived shrink-wrapped, Roy noticed a small corner of an exposed hazardous material (Flammable Liquid) label. He brought this to the attention of a DL supervisor and they began the internal notification process. Also on hand at the time of the finding was USCBP Inspector Steven Stahl, who confirmed the presence of the hazard labels and advised notification to the FAA. The packages were turned inwards and stacked against each other so the labels were not visible at the time of acceptance in ORD. Also, there was no DG paperwork present for the shipment. The shipment was quarantined and CVG notified DL's Corporate DG group (DGMG) via our internal notification system. DGMG advised CVG to quarantine the shipment and notify the local FAA Regional Office. The local Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) office in Cincinnati, Ohio has been notified and has inspected the shipment. The shipment consisted of 22 pieces, of which 21 are in CVG, with the last piece shown as Found Cargo in MXP. The question as to how one piece ended up in MXP is being investigated internally by Delta Air Lines.","The shipment appeared to have been prepared as ORM-D, a class of material not allowed by Delta. Delta requires shipments to be reclassified as Consumer Commidity for acceptance. The Flammable Liquid labels were what caused identification of this shipment, but probably also not required. Although the shipment moved via truck to CVG, the shipment was accept properly per current security guidlines. Due to the size of the packages and the need to break down the freight, they were identified to contain hazardous materials and were reported as required.",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Delta Air Lines, Inc.",US,

He had just loaded the tank onto a single axil 2 wheeled trailer when the release occurred. The gas in the tank may have shifted due to too much weight on the tire. While on the trailer, the tank tipped to its side and bent the external relief valve causing it to vent.  He was not driving.  Tank was at 75% so about 720 gallons dissipated unitl the tank was empty.     There is no evacuation valve on this older model tank. The filler valve on this older model tank did not have a dip tube.  The only way to get the gas out of this older model tank is to tip it on it's side and evacuate it though the filler valve.

This fall caused five 5-gallon buckets to be crushed and release the contents inside.  Upon this discovery, the driver called for a cleanup crew.  The crew arrived and began off loading the damaged containers of Power Champ Cleaner. The liquid released from the buckets had traveled the length of the trailer and soaked all the pallets.  The soaked pallets were removed and placed onto visqueen to prevent any contamination of the parking lot.  Each 5-gallon buket was de-palletized and placed onto a new, clean pallet.  The 21 soaked pallets were removed and sent for disposal at a FDEP Permitted Solid Waste facility.  All buckets of Power Champ that were not damaged were re-palletized and delivered into Cheney Brothers receiving.  The five damaged buckets were put into one 55-gallon drum for future disposal.  With the truck completely unloaded, granular sorbents were applied to absorb any free liquid left.  This material was swept up and placed into one 55-gallon drum for disposal.  The visqueen and ppe worn by the response team was placed into two 55-gallon drums for disposal.    The entire cleanup from initial notification to job completion took approximately 11 hours.",A recommendation will be made to the shipper to addequately block and brace pallets prior to shipment.

He was just leaving the compressor shack where he had turned all valves on to turn the compressor on to start filling. While working out of the compressor shack he heard a pop sound.  He reached in the doorway to shut off the compressor and there were flames.  The compressor is electric and this is how the trucks are loaded.  We suspect the flex connector (a flexible steel braided hose that is reinforced with stainless steel in the piping system)burst because all of the area above was burnt and everything below was not.  There was fire at a pressure gauge on the 30 gallon tank as well.  After arriving on scene, the fire department turned off the valve and stopped the gas from flowing.  The continuing fire stemmed from vapor coming from the piping near the compressor shack and a small grass fire.  This is an industrial park and two nearby companies were evacuated.  We are not sure of the exact number of people evacuated at this time.  Our employee was admitted to Emanuel Hospital Burn Center in Portland, OR and he is still there undergoing treatment for his burn injuries as of today.

Main Street,BARTOW,FL,33830,Other-Nationwide Emergency Res,"At approximately 9:30 am EST on Saturday, June 17, 2006, a red solution was observed dripping from the floor of a trailer parked at the Covenant Transport Oklahoma City Terminal. The solution dripped into water puddles on asphalt under the trailer. The driver notified Covenant Transport Risk Management Department that the haz mat cargo (resin solution) was leaking.  An Emergency Response Team, ERS, Inc. was mobilized to the site, arrived at approximately 10:50 am and proceeded to open the trailer. The leak appeared to be coming from one drum at the front of the trailer. Granular sorbents were placed on the spilled resin in the trailer to reduce vapors. The resin and water in the puddles under the trailer were absorbed with sorbents which were placed in a 55-gallon drum.  After off-loading the undamaged drums, the damaged drum was overpacked in a salvage drum.  The drum appeared to have been damaged by a sharp object or impact during loading. The ER Team scraped the resin from the floor of the trailer, removing the majority of the released product; however, an odor remained due to resin trapped within the floor boards. Cleanup activities were completed for the day at approximately 8:00 pm.  Final cleaning of the floor of the trailer was scheduled for Monday, at which time the wood on the floor of the trailer was pressure washed, with the rinseate collected and placed in the drum with previously containerized debris. This was somewhat effective, but did not satisfactorily remove the odor.  After consulting with the manufacturer and Covenant Transport Risk Management, it was decided to remove the impacted floor boards for disposal.  The wood was removed from a 3' x 3' area. The wood was placed in the 55-gallon drum. The underlying metal was wiped down with acetone to remove residual resin.

The one drum had a puncture hole with metal protruding.  The drum was laid on its side with loader and second operator assisting.  Dock supervisor contacted the carrier on-call HazMat Dept.  HazMat was informed of situation and advised having trained dock personnel to respond to the incident and having the immediate area evacuated until the cleanup was completed.    Dock called back and advised that the drum was fuming and airborne vapors were bothering personnel.  HazMat advised further evacuation of the area and contacted response crew to the scene.    HazMat notified HMHTTC to respond to the scene with an ETA of one hour.  HazMat Dept also contacted and notified Chemtrec at this time.    Within a half hour, dock called back to inform that the situation had escalated due to dock personnel requesting medical assistance.  Ambulance was called to the scene to transport two personnel to the hospital due to complaints of tightness of chest.  In addition to the ambulance, the local fire department responded.  Their arrival on the scene triggered additional assistance from Delran and the Burlington County HazMat Department.    11:45pm Dock called the HM Dept to inform that response crew is still not at the scene and that the local FD wanted an MSDS for the material.  MSDS was sent and HM Dept Manager decided to go to the scene.    12:00am Dock called the HazMat Department to inform that the response crew still was not at the scene and that the local Burlington County HazMat Dept were assuming Incident Command of the scene.    12:15am HM Dept Manager arrived at the scene as well as the Emergency Response contractor (HMHTTC).  The local FD and HM depts will not allow anyone on or near the dock due to potential exposure to the chemical.    1:00am – 3:00am Local FD and HM Depts controlled response of the incident.  Initial response to the scene involved approximately 21 vehicles including 5 ambulances and 10 fire trucks.  Entry to the dock was performed by two Burlington County HM personnel in Silver Suit Level A Response equipment.  The Incident Commander (IC) progressively reduced response PPE down to Level B by 3:00am.  IC continued to not allow HMHTTC into the scene or on the dock.  Local HM team neutralized spilled product, overpacked drum, and shoveled clean up from the floor into overpacks.    3:40am Dock was allowed to return to operation and moved overpacked drum/cleanup into the hazardous waste area for future disposal.",Cause of the incident was trailer floor repair that punctured bottom edge of the drum.

After leaving the roadway, the truck rolled 1.75 times, coming to a rest on the drivers side face west. The container, properly secured for normal driving, went through the fiberglass roof of the truck and came to rest at an angle on the ground. Less than 2 gallons (less than 8 lbs. a.i.) spilled out of the vent on top of the tank. Our driver was able to call for immediate assistance. After emergency response teams arrived from Ulysses, crew members were able to set the tank upright, and the Ieakage stopped.    Please note that there was no failure of the tank or fittings, in spite of the fact that response teams estimated the tank may have flown at least 12 feet in the air before coming to rest on the ground.    Most of the containers in tne truck remained in the truck. There was minor spillage of non-regulated materials inside of the truck, mainly from 2.5 gallon plastic containers and some paper bags.    This incident was called into the State Emergency Spill Response Center and National Response Center when we were notified of the accident and that trifluralin had been released, but before we knew if a reportable quantity had been released. It was not until several hours after the incident that we were able to determine (by weight) that a quantity less than the RQ had actually been released.","The accident was a result of driver error, and he was cautioned to drive more carefully in the future.

The driver hooked up to the trailer at approximately 3:30 pm (driver did not perform a pretrip inspection) and then went to the scale and was weighed. The driver noticed some leakage at this time but thought it was from the troughs that are used to hold the unloading hoses as it had rained in previous days. The driver left the loading facility and traveled west on US 50 (River Road) to north on St. Rt. 128 and then turned onto the eastbound ramp to I-74. He pulled over on the eastbound ramp because he noticed a splash and then secured the front dome. The driver then proceded onto his final destination of Univar USA Inc. at 4600 Dues Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon arrival at Univar the driver went to the trailer wash area and rinsed off the tractor and trailer. Upon pulling into the trailer wash area, he damaged the tractor's exhaust system. The driver then parked the tractor and trailer. The driver reported the exhaust system damage to the dispatcher and then left work for the day. The dispatcher went (now approximately 6:45 p.m.)to check the damage to the tractor and noticed marks on the tractor and trailer like it had been sprayed with acid or caustic. The truck and trailer was still wet from the rinsing. The dispatcher reported his findings to the Traffic Manager and they agreed to follow-up further the following day. Upon further investigation the next morning, the trailer and tractor was noted to have visible signs of sodium hydroxide residue. The domes were checked and the back dome was found to be unsecured. The driver's route was then retraced and there were signs along part of the route of sodium hydroxide spillage. The areas with the largest amount of spillage appeared to be at points where the driver had to come to a stop or make a turn. The two main areas were at the intersection of US 50 and St.R.t 128 and at the turn onto the eastbound I-74 ramp. There was no signs of spillage after the point were the driver stopped to secure the dome. Based on weight tickets from the loading faciltiy and the destination, it was determined that 3000 pounds of sodium hydroxie had been lost. At this point the notifications were made to the NRC and the Ohio EPA. A response contractor was hired to clean up any remaining liquid and absorbents (a local fire department and/or road crew had responded the previous day)in accordance with the Ohio EPA's recommendations.",All drivers will recieve additional training regarding pretrip inspections and reporting of spills.,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,1150,Univar USA Inc.,US,

About 32 gallons of Cheminova Methyl 4 EC was spilled entirely off the roadway in the dirt area adjacent to FM Road 50.  Wilbur-Ellis Company employees responded to the scene. The spilled insecticide, coniaminated soil and four inches of soil below the contamination line were placed in two salvage drums The drums will be disposed of as hazardous waste at an EPA approved facility.  The National Response Center was notified (Report #800495, Ms. Rawls).  The Texas Commission of Environmental Quality was also notified (Report #20061971, Jerri Henderson).
