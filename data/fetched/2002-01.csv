TONY STATED THAT HE TURNED UP THE ROAD AND ONCE IT WAS APPARENT TO HIM THAT HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO SAFELY NAVIGATE THE ROAD HE ATTEMPTED TO BACK THE TRACTOR TRAILER TO AN AREA WHERE HE COULD TURN AROUND. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO BACK THE TRAILER DOWN THE ROAD HE REALIZED THAT HE WOULD BE UNABLE TO CONTROL ITS DECENT DUE TO THE ICE AND SNOW ON THE ROADWAY. AT THIS POINT HE ATTEMPTED TO CALL FOR HELP BUT WAS UNABLE TO USE HIS TELEPHONE DUE TO THE LACK OF CELL SERVICE. HE THEN ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE THE RIG OVER THE MOUNTAIN TO A SAFE LOCATION. IT WAS THEN HE ENCOUNTERED THE CURVE IN THE ROADWAY THAT THE TRUCK WAS UNABLE TO SAFELY TRAVEL THROUGH. AS HE MADE THE TURN THE GROUND BENEATH THE REAR AXLE OF THE TRAILER BROKE LOOSE CAUSING THE REAR OF THE TANKER TO SLIDE INTO A DITCH THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY 10' DEEP. THIS SUBSEQUENTLY CAUSED THE TANKER TO TURN OVER ON ITS SIDE AND THUS PULLED THE REAR AXLES OF THE TRACTOR OVER TO APPROXIMATELY 75 DEGREES PERPENDICULAR TO THE ROADWAY. THE LOAD WAS IN ROUTE FROM LORDSBURG, NM TO CADIZ, CA WITH APPROXIMATELY 7,500 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL. OF THE 7,500 GALLONS OF FUEL ON BOARD THE TANKER PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT, APPROXIMATELY 1,500  GALLONS WAS LOST. THE SITE WAS CLEANED BY SOUTHWEST HAZARD CONTROL THROUGH THE USE OF BIOREMEDIATION. NO EXCAVATION WAS NECESSARY AND THE SPILL WAS CONSIDERED RELATIVELY MINOR WITH RESPECT TO THE ORIGINAL REPORTS FROM THE OFFICERS ON THE SCENE. APPROXIMATELY 3,000 GALLONS OF THE 6,000 GALLONS REMAINING IN THE TANKER WAS REMOVED BY CHEMICAL TRANSPORT, INC. AT THE SCENE IN AN EFFORT TO REMOVE THE WEIGHT FROM THE REAR AXLE OF THE TRAILER AS IT HAD BEEN DAMAGED IN THE ACCIDENT. THE DRIVER WAS SITED FOR RECKLESS OPERATION OF A VEHICLE, BY-PASSING THE SCALES AND LOG VIOLATIONS AMONG SOME OTHER MINOR THINGS I CAN NOT RECALL. I WAS SITED FOR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES AND DAMAGE TO TIMBER AS A RESULT OF A BRIDGE AND A TREE THAT HE ALSO STRUCK DURING THE ORDEAL. I WAS ISSUED THE CITATIONS BECAUSE TONY WAS NO LONGER AT THE SCENE WHEN I ARRIVED. NO PAYMENT WAS NECESSARY FOR THESE REPAIRS AS THE FEDERAL RANGER DECIDED THEY COULD BE REPAIRED BY NORMAL ROAD MAINTENANCE. THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED ON FEDERAL PROPERTY AND WAS THEREFORE UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WAS TOLD TO RELAY TO MY SUPERIORS THAT ALL OF THE VIOLATIONS RECEIVED DURING THE ACCIDENT WERE OF THE LOWEST POSSIBLE STATURE AND THAT NO FELONIES WERE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF TONY'S AND MILBAR'S COMPLETE COOPERATION AND QUICK AND COMPLETE RESPONSE TO THE PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE ACCIDENT.
