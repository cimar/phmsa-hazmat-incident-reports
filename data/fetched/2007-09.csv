Attempts to tighten the valve were unsucessful because the liquid valve stem was obstructed by the magnetic gauging device when the valve was turned.  The entire valve housing was removed by loosening and removing the valve flange bolts.  The liquid valve was removed from the valve base, new tape sealant applied to the threads and gasket sealer applied to the base gasket.  The valve assembly was then reassembled, reapplied and the flange bolts properly tightened stopping the release.    Note: The protective housing had an intact shipper's seal.  The seal was removed and the housing cover opened to expose the leaking valve.  The leaking valve had a tag applied which read "" Defective Valve Leaking"".  It is unknown by whom or when this tag was applied but it had to be in place before the housing cover was closed and sealed.

The Horizon Hunter had left Oakland and had completed cargo operations in Hawaii and was in route to Guam when the vessel personnel noticed the oxygen tank venting at 0730 in the morning on September 9th, 2006.  The venting continued all day.  The Captain phoned the National Response Center and reported the incident to me.  It is believed that the initial venting of the vapor caused the valve to freeze and it did not reseat properly.  The shipper was advised of the incident as well.  The valve reseated and the venting ceased prior to the vessel arrival at the port of Guam.",Bulk cargo tanks are designed to vent to relieve pressure.

The notification was made due to an  overturned MC-307 tank truck carrying diesel fuel located at 17901 Hwy 71N, Mira LA.    The release was reported at approximately 1310 hours (No Police Report yet has  been issued) and lasted until 2030 hours when the fuel tanker was transferred.  The tractor number was 1208 & the trailer number P227. The Caddo Parrish  Sheriff, Hazmat, and Fire units responded for this overturned tanker. Once  emergency crews arrived, the product leaking from the dome lids was contained  into poly buckets.    The circumstances leading to the accident are still under investigation by the  Caddo Parrish Sheriff's Office and the Safety Department for Flying J  Transportation. The driver was transporting 7,950 gallons diesel fuel (CAS #  88334-30-5) UN1993, DOT Class 3, PG III,(MSDS Enclosed)  from 4731 Viking Driver, Bossier City, LA 71111 to Highway 108 Texarkana AR  71854. The PRO # was 1888979. It is estimated approximately 20 gallons of  diesel fuel was released through the dome lids at the on set of the incident. The  Caddo Hazmat Unit attempted to seal the leak with the use of a Plug and Dike  material around the leaking domes with no success. The response team then  placed containment units under each of the three leaking dome lids.  Additionally, a total of 5 gallons of oil and approximately 20 gallons of diesel  fuel were lost from the tractor as a result of the accident.    Highway 71 was closed, according to Sgt. Mike Grey of the Caddo Parrish Sheriff  & Hazmat Response Unit, from 1310 to 2157 hours. The response team from  Highway 59 out of Texarkana, AR responded to the site to transfer the product  and remediate the soil.    The response crew developed a safety plan to transfer the product from the  damaged tanker to an awaiting tanker. The crew donned Nomex fire-gear  and/or Nomex coveralls and initially, grounded and bonded the tankers. The  response team then began drilling the tanker into each of the three compartments  at 1700 hours and completed the drilling at 1800 hours. The response team  began vacuuming product shortly thereafter and transferred to an awaiting  Flying J tanker (Truck no. 1092 & Trailer no. P472). The transfer was completed  at 2030 hours. The crew then stood-by until the wrecker company; Lloyd's  Wrecker Service up-righted and removed the damaged T/T.

CSX Transportation dispatched SPSI to respond to the Cumberland Rail Yard to investigate. SPSI arrived to find that the manway cover bolts were not tool tight but were hand tight. There was some corrosion on the manway nozzle which also contributed to the manway cover gasket not completely seating against the manway nozzle. The car also did not have the required outage. SPSI pumped off approximately 1000 gallons of product into a tank truck. The car was then prepared for transportation and released.

It was determined by CSXT field personnel, that vapors were escaping from around the manway cover. It also appeared some of the manway gasket was protruding from under the manway cover and base.  A CSXT emergency response contractor, Veolia Environmental, was dispatched to the scene to inspect the car and make repairs.  Upon arrival, Veolia found the tank car had a bad manway cover gasket and proceeded to install a temporary Teflon rope gasket, since a replacement gasket was not immediately available. The manway cover was then secured from further release and the odor stopped.  It was recommended that once the car was unloaded, that a new manway cover gasket be installed.

Approximately 20 gallons of material leaked into the box of the truck and onto the trucks rear tires.  A pedestrian on a bicycle received a spray of material as the truck drove by.  He was taken to the hospital for treatment and released.  The IBC's discharge valve somehow partially opened after the driver reported going oversome potholes.  The driver immediately closed the valve and placed containment under his truck to soak up the spill.  The Buffalo Fire Dept. and the Buffalo Police closed the road while our spill response team cleaned up the spill materials.","The IBC's had been loaded sideways in the bed of the truck to minimize movement between them.  It is possible that when the truck hit the potholes, the IBC bounced, hit the outside wall of the truck and opened the valve. Our loading procedures have been changed and our personnel have been re-trained to only load IBCs onto the truck with the discharge valves facing the rear of the truck. Additional load straps will be used to prevent container movement.

The driver of the vehicle noticed small amount of liquid on the floor of the van trailer while performing a post-trip vehicle inspection.  Additionally, the driver notices a small amount of liquid starting to seep through the floor boards of the trailer.   He immediately notified his supervisor of the spill and an in house emergency response crew was dispatched to identify the source of release and to take all necessary corrective actions.  Upon review of the paperwork, the emergency response crew donned appropriate protective equipment and entered the trailer.  An inspection of the non-bulk packages in the trailer identified that a single 55-gallon UN 1A1 container of Class 8 liquid developed a small pin-hole on the bottom and released about 1 gallon of material onto the trailer floor.  The response crew immediately used a chemically compatible absorbent material to prevent any additional liquid seeping through the trailer onto the pavement below.   After the absorbent materials were applied to the floor of the trailer, the trailer was moved into a secondary containment bay in order to avoid any additional contamination of the parking area. The leaking drum was placed in a suitable salvage drum and all of the absorbent was collected and placed into appropriate container for disposal at an approved hazardous waste management facility.  Please note that approximately one quart of material leaked through the floorboards of the van-trailer onto the pavement the majority of the released material was contained in the van trailer.     The time frame from the initial notice of the spill until the drum was overpacked and the spill clean up was approximately 1 hours.  All of the released material was collected and no offsite impact occurred.","Our investigation determined that the cause of the incident was deterioration of the container on storage and insufficient inspection prior to transportation.    The individuals responsible for preparing this shipment for transportation will be informed of this incident and a request will be made to the involved parties to undergo additional training on container inspections.

Eight - one gallon containers of cumyl hydroperoxide, <=90%, were packaged into two 14-gallon UN rated fiber containers (4x1 gallon in each container) with the appropriate absorbent and sealed properly.  All lab pack containers and waste stream containers were properly loaded, segregated, placarded and secured on a Veolia truck for transportation from the customer site to a Veolia TSDF located in Azusa, CA.  Shortly after the Veolia driver left the site, at approximately 4:15 p.m., he noticed during his regular mirror checks that smoke was emanating from the back of his trailer.  At this point he was traveling westbound on the 210 freeway in the city of Rancho Cucamonga, and felt that there was not enough room on the side of the expressway to safely pull over, so he exited at the first available cross street.  The Veolia truck exited at Milliken Street and proceeded northbound approximately 40 feet to the first available safe pull off area.  The Veolia driver then unlocked the back door of his trailer and opened it.  More smoke bellowed out of the back of the truck, so he closed it immediately.  The driver then called the Veolia Branch Field Services Operations Manager, and informed him of the situation.  The driver was instructed by the Operations Manager to call 911 immediately.       The Veolia driver donned the appropriate PPE and entered the back of the trailer and determined that one of the 14-gallon drums containing the cumyl hydroperoxide was smoldering and generating a large amount of smoke.  He was able to determine that there were no visible flames, just heavy amounts of smoke.  The lid of the container was taken out to verify the hazard class and shipping label to provide emergency responders with proper information to handle the situation.  The Rancho Cucamonga Fire Department showed up on-site at approximately 5:00 p.m. and assessed the situation.  They called for their Hazmat team who came and extinguished the drum with water and removed it from the truck.  After the smoldering was extinguished, the Hazmat team packaged the contents of the burned fiber drum into a 5-gallon poly pail.  This 5-gallon pail was then over-packed into a 14-gal poly container.  Veolia Hazmat responders arrived onsite at approximately 5:30 p.m. and cleaned the back of the truck and picked up any residual absorbent from the street.  They also inspected the packaging by the fire department and found that there was still heat being generated inside the overpack drum.  In response, the inner container was removed from the 14-gallon drum and inspected, revealing a soiled rag wrapped around one of the gallon containers of cumyl hydroperoxide.  Veolia responders believe this to be the root cause of the incident, as this dirty rag probably contained some organics and","In response, Veolia has discussed the incident in subsequent weekly safety meetings, focusing on the details/events of the incident, root causes, newly instituted protocol changes for handling organic peroxides/oxidizers, preventative measures, etc.  Veolia has revised, in a formal document, a new SOP for the safe handling/packaging (in lab-packs)/shipping of organic peroxides and oxidizers.  This SOP has been promptly distributed to all field personnel, project managers, field supervisors and all other individuals that might be involved in hazardous waste shipments.  This new SOP has been implemented immediately and along with complying with all DOT packaging requirements, specifically states that all organic peroxides (OP) and oxidizers are to be sealed individually in plastic bags with no other materials present in the container.  All drums are to be lined with an additional poly liner (double-lined) and all caps of bottles containing OP and oxidizers shall be sealed and secured to help prevent leakage.  All OP and oxidizers will be packed with clay absorbent unless there is a compatibility concern/issue.  Strict segregation requirements will continue to be followed in packaging and loading of these materials.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Fiber drum,1G,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2250,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

TomRobinson, Manager Hazardous Materials Management, was notified and responded.    Upon arrival, tank car ACFX 71267 was found tobe emitting an intermittent odor from within the protective housing. Inspection revealed a slight vapor release from the plug of the air inlet valve. The plug was tightened an additional two turns and this stopped the release. Due to the strong and enduring odor characteristic of the commodity, a bleach solution was applied to the interior of the protective housing and this neutralized the odor.    09:18 PM, Charles Slater, Director of Terminal Operations advised a conductor was exposed to the material released from Tankcar ACFX 71267 in the Livonia Yard. Mr. Slater further advised the employee was experiencing irritation on his face, neck, shoulders, and sinuses. Mr. Slater stated the employee was also experiencing a headache. Mr. Slater further stated John Valley, Manager, took the employee to the Baton Rouge General Hospital.    9/15/07, At 06:11 AM, Robinson stated yard personnel complained the odor remained in the yard at 03:00 AM and the car was isolated onto track #105. Mr. Robinson advised after re-inspection he discovered avapor release from the pressure relief valve and a Technician of U.S. Environmental Company, a contractor, was en route to helpreplace the o-rings. During this operation it was discovered that the valve stem of the pressure relief valve was loose and o-ring replacement did not stop the vapor release. The shipper, Arkema made arrangements for RESCAR technicians to replace the pnrelief valve while United States Environmental personnel drew a vacuum and scrubbed vapors to eliminate any odor release. The pressure relief valve was successfully replaced on Sunday, 9/16/07 and the tank was pressure tested by RESCAR on Tuesday, 9/18/07.    PART III - PACKING INFORMATION: Question 25. (continued):  3.

The in-house emergency response team over-packed the leaking containers, and because the shipment comprised 24 additional containers of the same hazardous material stream, the decision was made to go ahead and over-pack all the individual containers of the entire shipment. This precaution was taken to eliminate the risk that additional leaks might occur while the load was in-transit.

The carman was able to close this outlet and secure it with wire cabling. The A-end bottom outlet door was open approximately two inches and its locking assembly was missing with seal intact. A BNSF environmental contractor used a vacuum truck to vacuum up all spillage that was found. A nearby agricultural entity was able to use the recovered ammonium nitrate from the vacuum truck for agricultural purposes.

Christian Kingsford began his trip in Denver, Co at approximately 6am on Sunday September 16th.  He loaded 8200 gallons of gasoline on his tanker truck at the Sinclair terminal in Henderson, CO.  His destination was Grand Junction Colorado with no stops in between.  All information indicated the beginning of this trip was uneventful.      About two and one half hours in to the trip heading westbound down the backside of Vail Pass the driver lost control of his truck.  Information from his onboard XATA computer indicates he may not have had the truck in gear with an average RPM count around 600.  He gradually and steadily began picking up speed until he ran off the right side of the road at 0928 at mile marker 181.  The onboard computer shows his speed at 96 miles per hour at the time of the crash.  The driver made a short call to 911 before the crash stating the truck was out of control.      The tractor came unhitched from the trailer skidding on the passenger side before coming to a stop upright.  The trailer appears to have flipped and/or rolled and came to a stop lying on its right side.      The Vail fire chief reached Bob Akin at the Sinclair trucking terminal in Salt Lake City around 1030.  He made calls to the National Response Center, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and began trying to reach someone in the Denver office. The on-duty dispatcher at the Denver office was notified at 1245 of the incident and she called for HAZMAT clean-up and dispatched a truck in an attempt to pump off any remaining gasoline in the tanker.      The impact of the crash ripped two holes in the tanker.  The first hole was in between the second and third compartments about two feet long and one foot wide.  The second hole was on the left side on the top above the second compartment.  It measured approximately four feet long and gaped open about six inches.      5188 gallons of gasoline spilled out on to the ground through these two holes while 3012 gallons was pumped off the truck and recovered.  The estimated time of release was approximately five hours.  The preventative measure taken to mitigate the effect of the release was the dispatch of the closest available tanker to pump off the remaining gasoline.",Sinclair Oil Corporation maintains a good safety record due to our regular safety meetings with drivers and superb maintenance of our equipment.  This accident appears to have occurred due to driver error.

The leak was coming from a drum that had turned over and had a small drip coming from one of the bungs. Our driver contained the spill which was just a drip from the bung in the drum and all totaled a wet spot of about 2 ft. in diameter.  The Valspar dock worker was there also and notified their Safety Director. The Univar driver called in to the Spartanburg branch to report the incident and said that everything was ok but their Safety Director would not let any of his employees assist our driver in getting other products moved to acces the leaking drum. Due to logistics and response time we contacted Nuway Industrial Services to go assist our driver. Within 30 minutes of Nuway's arrival time they had everything cleaned up, all material back on the trailer and our driver continued on to make his deliveries. The bung in the drum that had leaked was checked for proper torque and was delivered to its original destination. Our driver said that he had just taken a break a few miles before arriving at the customer and there was no evidence of a leak at that time and he also went back to see if anything had leaked as he came through the customers parking lot but did not see anything so apparently the drum had just tipped over as he pulled into the customers facility.","Incident was discussed in monthly employee safety meeting and load securement requirements were emphasized, additional load securement training will be included in future monthly meeting.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1216,Univar USA Inc.,US,

Stopped behind our vehicle was a mini-van. A tractor trailer travelling behind the mini-van failed to seetraffic was stopped and struck the mini-van; pushing it out of the lane of traffic. The tractor-trailer continued forward striking our hazmat vehicle sending it off the road and down an embankment. The force of the impact was severe enough to break parts-bins and shelves from their mounts, and break containers free of their cargo straps, causing containers to careen through the van; some puncturing.     After coming to rest, our driver retrieved his 'driver's book' containing his daily load sheet (which was kept by theresponding CHP officer) and MSDS for each product on his truck.    Damage to the cargo-box door rendered it inoperable until emergency responders were on-scene. Thosecontainers that were punctured or damaged continued to leak until that time; some 30 minutes. Hazmat clean-upcontractors isolated the spill and, erring on the side of safety, removed all contents of our truck treating all contents contaminated by class 8 corrosives.",It is unlikely that any additional measures could be taken to protect against such a catastrophic event.

Upon recepit of the report, company personnel proceeded to establish a safe zone and isolate the subject unit. Shipping documents were obtained in order to establish the size of the safety perimeter. Soon thereafter, the jurisdictional federal agency (i.e. USCG), local police and fire departments, as well as the port authority and an environmental response contractor, were contacted in order to initiate remediation of the incident.    Upon further evaluation by the responding authorities, the scene was deemed safe for contractor remediation operations to commence, without the continued presence of the aforementioned governmental authorities. The leaking substance was identified as one of the hazardous commodities contained therein (i.e. UN 2789, ACETIC ACID, GLACIAL in plastic drums). The cause of the spill was determined to be due to the overturning of an improperly secured drum, thus allowing the commodity to leak through a package vent closure. All spilled material was recovered and properly salvage packed for subsequent transportation and disposal by the environmental contractor.

Upon remediation by responding fire department and environmental response contractor personnel, it was determined that the source of the leak originated from a 55-gal drum containing non-hazardous (non-regulated) commodity (in this case, an industrial diesel engine coolant). Upon discovery of this issue, it was also discovered that a pallet of undeclared hazardous materials was contained therein. The shipment was placed on hold until the proper documentation could be obtained from the shipper.

Upon removing seal it was observed that leak was emanating from liquid valve stem. Pressure was relieved off the car by actuating the vacuum relief device and slightly opening the vapor valve which stopped leak.  Upon stopping leak, packing nut which was deep seated on liquid valve was removed to check packing material condition. Packing material was observed to be non existent either due to age and/or other reasons. Packing material was applied to valve stem, along with packing nut and car was repaired to good order after checking for any further leaks.

JONES,SAFETY DIRECTOR,2565 MATHIAS REACEWAY ROAD S.W.,NEW PHILADELPHIA,OH,44663,Carrier,"Most of this Hydrochloric acid delivery proceeded as normal. The product was being unloaded though a valve at the top of the cargo tank. The cargo tank was a little over half-full at the start of unloading with approximately 3,000 gallons aboard, so internal air pressure developed gradually. The tractor air compressor was used since plant compressed air was not readily available. A maximum of about 10 p.s.i. of air pressure was used to begin the product moving from the tank trailer to the plant line which runs up the side of the building and into a plant acid storage tank.  About 30 minutes into a typical 40 minute delivery, the driver and another person in the area noted that product began spraying from the rear underside of the trailer. The driver immediately shut off the air line valve and replaced his half-face respirator with his full-face respirator. He identified the leaking of a capped-off and safety-wired valve at the base of the trailer tank. A small hole had developed in the exterior steel valve wall of the rubber-lined valve, which was now spraying acid out onto the trailer undercarriage, where it flowed and pooled on the plant loading dock ramp area. The driver described it as looking similar to a home water pipe that develops a small crack from freezing, spraying its contents out (but this cause was apparently lining failure and internal corrosion of steel by acid instead of the mechanical effects of freezing water). There were other drivers and employees in the general area, so word of the incident traveled quickly to plant management.  A plant spill response team rallied, and they were soon joined by various emergency responders and governmental agency representatives. This Safety Director notified the National Spill Response Center and directed the driver to call 9-1-1 as they advised. This was followed by discussion of the events with representatives of the Federal EPA, the State of Ohio EPA, Great West Casualty Company (this carrier’s insurance company), and later to the Cleveland Division of the Environment.  With the permission of the Incident Commander, the driver lowered the trailer dolly legs, released the fifth-wheel’s kingpin latch and pulled the tractor out from under the trailer. Then he was able to lower the front (uphill) end of the trailer to keep some of the remaining product contained in the trailer tank, as the product ran forward, away from the leaking valve. Note that the bottom valve wall developed the hole. The defective valve  was “closed” the entire time. The valve wall leaked, but there was no leaking from the capped bottom valve opening. Closing the top unloading valve had no effect on the leak.  The shipper was able to arrange for a truck from their Mini-Bulk fleet to arrive on scene equipped with an acid-resistant diaphragm pump. The leaking became less forceful as the trailer tank pressure bled off, so emergency responders were able to use containment devices to collect much of the leaking liquid once",THE BOTTOM UNLOADING VALVE WAS NOT BEING USED FOR ANY DELIVERIES. THE VALVE HAS BEEN REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH A BLIND (NO OPENING) FLANGE.

BAX Global, Inc. performed clean up using gloves and ½ a 40 pound bag of floor dry.  Approximately 20 pounds of waste were generated and placed into one (1) 30-gallon steel recovery drum.  BAX Global, Inc. will coordinate disposal internally, in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  The remainder of the shipment was forwarded to the consignee.  The MSDS was requested and received.  No injuries or exposures were reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be related to mishandling, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.  BAX Global Inc. will continue to reinforce safe handling procedures and guidelines to all personnel.",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,SPILL CENTER INC.,US,

The facility manager was immediately notified and an in-house response crew was dispatched to identify the source of release and to initiate all necessary corrective actions.  Upon review of the paperwork, the emergency response crew donned appropriate protective equipment and entered the trailer.  Once inside trailer, the response crew determined that the cause of the release was attributed to a 55-gallon non-bulk package that had tipped over in-transit allowing approximately 20 gallons of a corrosive material to escape from the top closure of the package.  Please note that approximately 5 gallons did escape from the trailer onto a fully contained concrete parking area below.  The container was placed in the upright position and the crew applied chemically compatible absorbent to absorb and contain the released material.  The package involved in this incident was placed into a suitable salvage drum and all of the absorbent material was collected and placed into appropriate container for disposal at fully licensed hazardous waste management facility.",Our investigation determined that the cause of the incident was improper preparation for transportation and inadequate cargo blocking and bracing.  The driver as well as the individuals involved in the execution of this particular operation have been re-instructed in the selection of proper containers and proper blocking and bracing techniques.,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

While offloading freight at customer location, a pallet was discovered crushed inside the trailer.  Two (2) cartons were damaged, which resulted in the release of approximately 8 gallons of free product.  The Meadowbrook Fire Department was contacted to assess the site.  Upon arrival, the Meadowbrook FD applied absorbent material to the free product, and containerized the damaged freight.  H.M.H.T.T.C., Inc. of Wilmington, Delaware was dispatched to perform the remainder of cleanup.  Upon inspection of the trailer, H.M.H.T.T.C., Inc. discovered that the free product had contaminated the surrounding cartons around the pallet.  H.M.H.T.T.C., Inc. proceeded to containerize the contaminated freight.  All in tact freight was repalletized and reshrinwrapped, to be sent on to its destination.  Three (3) 55-gallon drums, which contained the spent absorbent material, contaminated cartons, and damaged freight, were generated during the cleanup.  Disposal was coordinated by H.M.H.T.T.C., Inc. in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.

HDMU 213210 was carefully moved to the containment area for further observation and investigation. Consignee contract responders reported finding 50 pound paper bags of product stacked on pallets. Seven of these bags were found leaking product from nail puncture holes incurred by nail protrusions from the wooden blocking and bracing (B+B) used to secure the lading inside this container. The leaking dry product mixed with moisture/water and this slurry type mixture was observed leaking from HDMU 213210. The damaged bags were placed into two 55 gallon poly lined salvage drums.

All non-compromised lading was returned inside the cleaned HDMU 213210 container properly blocked and braced. The salvage drums were removed by the contractor and taken to their facility for appropriate future disposal.

A trained Veolia supervisor was attempting to load a cubic yard box onto the end of the trailer,(which involves pushing the cubic yard box onto the trailer from the dock), when he accidently punctured a drum with the fork. This was caused by the fork protruding approximately 203 inches beyond the edge of the pallet of the cubic yard box.  The drum was punctured and the material puddled onto the sealed asphalt pavement. The material was cleaned up using speedi dry and absorbant pads. The punctured drum was overpacked into an 85 gallon container, and all spill material cleaned up by onsite personal. The spill material never left the sealed portion of the asphalt.","The employee's supervisor had a short training discussion with the employee on proper loading techniques.

After the delivery of the first compartment, driver removed his delivery hose from the customer’s storage tank to verify adequate storage. Driver failed to reconnect the deilvery hose after verifying that the tank had adequate storage. Driver then opened the discharge valve on his second compartment spilling 40 gallons of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel onto the pavement The spilled diesel covered an area of approximatly 1,000 square feet. The driver, Deltona Fire Dept. and the customer’s employees contained the spill with booms & oil dry until Mckenzie Tank Lines emergency responders arrived on scene to clean up the spill.    Note — Initial assessment by Deltona Fire Dept. states the spill was caused by overtilling the storage tank. After further investigation, Deltona Fire Dept concluded that the spill was caused by the driver’s failure to reconnect his hose after verifying adequate tank storage.",DRIVER WILL BE REVIEWED FOR PROPER TRAINING IN THE PRECEDURES FOR LOADING & UNLOADING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.

We use air pressure to off load the rail cars and use a bolted flange connection that is attached from the top of the railcar. This is then connected to a quick connect fitting above the valve and a hose goes over to the truck that is to be loaded.   About 20 minutes into the loading process one of the four bolts on the flange failed   allowing product to spray from the railcar between our flange fitting and the railcar   fitting. Our manager immediately took the air pressure of the car and then tried to tighten the bolt back down but was unable to stop the leak. The car continued for 10 minutes to release product as the pressure came off the car. After failing to be able to tighten the bolt the manager climbed down off the railcar and with the help of two other terminal employees they used our spill containment kit to contain the spill. Our facility is   completely self-contained so product is unable to be release off the property. Our   employees contained the spill to a small area 3 feet by 20 feet and used soda ash on site to neutralize the spill and soak up the ferric chloride solution. They then swept up the soda ash and place in 55 gallon drums.,It was discovered that the bolt that failed was pitted from corrosion and should have been replaced when the flange was put on. We have also changed our SOP to include bolt inspection and that only stainless steel or Teflon coated bolts could be used in attaching the flange. We immediately order all new stainless steel bolts for the Baltimore terminal.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8450,,US,

A UP employee reported seeing a vapor cloud at the top of the car, and evidence that some liquid product had been released. No injuries were reported, and no drains or waterways were impacted. Local authorities were notified. At approximately 11:11 Hrs, Oskaloosa Dispatch informed UP that a “precautionary” evacuation was ordered  the Incident Commander (IC). At approximately 12:45 hrs, Mark Maday, Manager Hazardous Materials Management, arrived on scene and received a briefing from the Incident Commander. Mr. Maday advised the IC that the evacuation could be lifted since the commodity presented no risk to the general public. The IC informed Mr. Maday that he wanted the car evaluated first and would then decide if the evacuation should be lifted. At approximately 13:40 hrs, Mr. Maday reported that he had completed the inspection of the car, and that the cause of the leak was the Safety Vent Assembly. He stated that a nut had come off of one of the bolts that secures the Safety Vent Assembly to the car. He further advised that the loss of the nut allowed the Vent Assembly to lean and provide a pathway for product out of the car. Maday stated that the missing nut was still on the car and in good condition. However, a new nut was purchased locally, and he completed the repair to the car so that it could be moved. Mr. Maday also stated that the IC gave the order to lift the evacuation at approximately 13:29 Hrs. At approximately 14:21 Hrs, Mr. Maday reported that the car had been resecured and that the car was being moved off of the crossing and into the yard, and that normal operations were getting underway. Mr. Maday stated that he has talked with the shipper, ERCO Worldwide, and that a contact team was enroute to re-Inspect the car before it moved to destination. At approximately 08:00 hrs on September 25, Mr. Maday reported that he has talked with Mr. Randy Rowe, ERCO Worldwide, and that the Safety Vent Assembly had been reinspected and checked for tightness, and that a complete re-inspection of the car had been completed and that the load could be moved to destination.",Follow-up with shipper on loadinglinspection procedures.

Upon response teams arrival, a pallet of cans containing varnish were found to have been crushed by the weight of pallets and material placed on top of it. The area impacted by the spilled product was limited to the area directly surrounding the pallet inside the trailer and directly below the trailer on the ground outside. It was estimated that less than 1 gallon of material was outside of the trailer on the ground.Pallets of small boxes that were on top of the pallet of varnish were broken down and removed. After the stacked pallets were removed, it was found that there were twenty-four (24) 1 gallon cans on the pallet, of which twelve (12) were damaged, spilling a total of approximately 2 gallons. The damaged containers were removed and packaged intoa 17H 55g drum along with all cleanup debris.

Mr. Cooper further stated approximately five gallons had leaked onto the ground, and had been contained with absorbent. 14e requested shipper notification through Chemtrec, and the Los Angeles City Fire Department be notified for information only. He further stated it would be three to four hours before they would be able to determine where the leak originated as the entire lading was 55 gallon drums. During the off loading, it was noted a one inch honeycombed cardboard had been used for the bi-level separation. Almost every drum in the top tier had spun and ‘cookie’ cut through the cardboard, to the point where six drums on the floor had been deheaded by the top drums spinning. A total of 32 drums were damaged and leaking, estimating approximately 700 gallons of product had been lost during transit. The remaining 40 drums were so severely damaged that they were deemed unfit for further transportation. All of the leaking drums were patched and placed into salvage drums for containment. The remaining drums were placed back into the original container for temporary storage. Shipper contact developed the best course was to properly dispose of the lading.
