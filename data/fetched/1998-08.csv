AS I LOOKED IN THE MIRROR I NOTICED THERE WAS SOMETHING LEAKING OUT OF THE REAR OF THE TRAILER.  I WAS APPROACHED EXIT #123, AND DECIDED TO PULL OFF INTO THE TRUCK STOP THERE TO CHECK IT OUT.  IT WAS AROUND 4:30 PM.  AS I LIFTED THE DOOR I COULD SEE THAT A DRUM WAS LEAKING.  IT WASN'T LEAKING A GREAT DEAL BUT ENOUGH TO CREATE A PUDDLE IN THE TRAILER AND A DRIBBLE OUT OF THE BACK.  THE DRUM WAS ON THE BACK ROW AND THE GENERATOR WAS ""JACKSON PRESS"" IN INDIANAPOLIS.  THE PRODUCT LEAKING FELT, LOOKED AND SMELLED LIKE A TYPE OF WATER BASED CLEANER.  AS I WAS CLEANING UP THE LEAKAGE WITH SOME RAGS, A POLICEMAN CAME UP AND ASKED WHAT WAS GOING ON.  HE THEN CALLED THE SPICELAND FIRE DEPT.  WHILE THEY AND THE SHERIFFS DEPT WERE ARRIVING.  I GOT AN OVERPACK FROM THE TRAILER AND GOT THE ABSORBENT AND RAGS FROM THE SPILL KIT.  AFTER I SPREAD THE ABSORBENT AND FORMED A BARRIER WITH THE SOCKS (JUST IN CASE).  THEY TOLD ME I HAD TO STAY BACK WHILE THEY DID THEIR JOBS.  I THE CALLED SUPERVISOR TO REPORT IT.  AFTER THEIR TRYING FOR QUITE SOME TIME TO REMOVE THE DRUM FROM THE TRAILER (UNSUCCESSFULLY) I WENT OVER TO THE GARAGE (AT THE TRUCK STOP)  AND ASKED TO USE SOME SCRAP TIRES STACKED AROUND BACK. I STACKED 4 SEMI TIRES AT THE BACK OF THE TRAILER AND PUSHED THE DRUM OVER ONTO THE TIRES.  THEN I HAD TWO OF THE FIREMAN TILT AND HOLD THE OVERPACK AGAINST THE TIRE. WHILE I PUSHED THE DRUM OVER AND INTO IT.  I BORROWED A BROOM FROM THE GARAGE CLEANED UP EVERYTHING AND PUT IT IN THE OVERPACK ALSO.  I THEN SEALED THE OVERPACK.  AFTER ALL OF THIS, A DOT OFFICER ARRIVED.  HE ASKED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD A LEAKING DRUM.  LOOKING AT THE OVER PACK, HE ASKED WHERE WAS IT LEAKING.  I TOLD HIM THAT THAT WAS AN OVERPACK. HE THEN LOOKED AROUND AND ASKED WHERE THE DRUM WAS.  I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THE DRUM WAS IN THE OVERPACK.  HE ASKED FOR THE MANIFEST AND ALL OF MY CREDENTIALS AND WENT BACK TO HIS CAR.  MEANWHILE THE FIRE DEPT & SHERIFF LEFT.  I THEN INTO THE TRUCKSTOP TO MAKE SOME PHONE CALLS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE OVERPACK BACK INTO THE TRAILER.  AS I WAS SPEAKING TO STEVE MAHONEY, DENNIS BROWN CAME IN.  WE DECIDED TO CALL A TOW TRUCK SERVICE IN CAMBRIDGE CITY.  WHEN THEY ARRIVED WE WRAPPED THE CABLE AROUND THE DRUM AND LIFTED IT ONTO THE TRAILER.  WE SECURED THE LOAD AND THAT WAS THAT.  BY THEN THE DOT OFFICER WAS FINISHED.  HE ISSUED SEVERAL WARNINGS AND A TICKET FOR A LEAKING DRUM.

WHEN HE OPENED THE VALVES AND TESTED FOR LEAKS HE NOTICED A SMALL LEAK AT THE PACKING GLAND OF THE FRONT LIQUID VALVE.  AT THIS POINT HE UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIED TO TIGHTEN THE PACKING GLAND OF THE VALVE WITH NO IMPROVEMENT.  HE THEN CLOSED THE VALVE, BUT THAT DID NOT STOP THE LEAK.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CHLORINE WAS BEING FED BACK FROM THE CUSTOMER ONLINE STORAGE TANKCAR INTO THE LIQUID VALVE ON THE CARGO TANK.  ALL TRUCK AND CUSTOMER VALVES WERE THEN SHUT.  THE DRIVER THEN PURGED THE LIQUID LINE INTO THE CAUSTIC SYSTEM ON HIS TRUCK HOPING THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO DISCONNECT, BUT THERE WAS TOO MUCH CHLORINE ALREADY IN THE LINE FROM THE CUSTOMER'S TANK TO SUCCESSFULLY PURGE OUT OF THE LINE.  AFTER DISCUSSING THE SITUATION WITH THE OPERATOR, THEY DECIDED TO PULL A VACUUM ON THE LIQUID LINE FROM THE CUSTOMER'S TANK SYSTEM TO CLEAR THE CHLORINE FROM THE LINE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DISCONNECT.  WHEN THE LIQUID LINE INDICATED CLEAR AT THE CUSTOMER TANK SYSTEM MONITOR, THE DRIVER ATTEMPTED TO DISCONNECT THE LINE FITTINGS AND RECEIVED A MINOR EXPOSURE TO CHLORINE THAT WAS TILL IN THE LINE.  IT WAS FURTHER DETERMINED THAT THE LIQUID LINE HAD A FROZEN PLUG OF ICE IN THE LINE THAT PREVENTED THE COMPLETE REMOVAL OF THE CHLORINE FROM THE LINE.  THIS ICE PLUG OCCURRED BECAUSE THE VACUUM PROCESS PRODUCES A NEGATIVE PRESSURE THAT ALLOWS THE CHLORINE TO AUTO-REFRIGERATED AND FREEZE IF THE PROCESS IS PERFORMED TOO QUICKLY.  THE OPERATOR PILLED ADDITIONAL VACUUM ON THE LINE FOR ANOTHER 30-45 MINUTES BEFORE HE AND THE DRIVER WERE ABLE TO DISCONNECT THE LINES.  THE CARGO TANK WAS RETURNED TO THE ALL-PURE FACILITY IN SANTA FE SPRINGS, CA AND THE DEFECTIVE VALVE WAS REPLACED ON THE TRAILER ON 8/11/98 AFTER THE TRAILER WAS EMPTIED AND PURGED.  THE DRIVER WAS TAKEN TO A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL FOR OBSERVATION, THE DOCTOR FOUND NO INDICATIONS OF INJURY AND RELEASED THE DRIVER TO RETURN TO WORK THE NEXT DAY.  THE VALVES PACKING GLAND WAS OVER TIGHTENED, PROPERLY DURING THE LOADING PROCESS, AND THIS FAILED WHEN CONNECTED TO A LIVE SYSTEM AND THE VALVES WERE OPENED.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT IF A VALVE IS IDENTIFIED AS DEFECTIVE DURING LOADING IT SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE AND REPLACED/REPAIRED IMMEDIATELY.

HE ADVISED THAT THE CARBON DIOXIDE STORAGE TANK IN THE BUILDING HAD SPRUNG A LEAK. THE CARBON DIOXIDE WAS COMING OUT SO FAST THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM.  EVERYONE IN OUR BUILDING WAS EVACUATED AND ACCOUNTED FOR, AND SURROUNDING BUILDINGS WERE ALSO EVACUATED.   I ASKED CLARK IF HE COULD GO TO THE BACK OF THE BUILDING AND OPEN THE REAR DOOR TO VENTILATE THE BUILDING.  HE SAID THAT THE CARBON DIOXIDE WAS COMING OUT SO FAST THAT HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT GOING BACK THERE.  I TOLD CLARK TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND ADVISE THEM OF THE SITUATION.  I GOT RENO ON THE OTHER PHONE LINE AND INFORMED HIM OF THE SITUATION.  WE DISCUSSED WHERE THE LEAK COULD BE COMING FROM.  CLARK SAID THAT HE HAD JUST FINISHED FILLING THE BULK TRUCK AND HAD DISCONNECTED FROM THE HOSE, THEN PULLED THE TRUCK OUT OF THE BUILDING.  CHRIS WAS IN THE BUILDING FILLING CYLINDERS, WHEN THIS OCCURRED.  HE RAN OUT OF THE BUILDING THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR.  I TOLD CLARK TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE LEAK, MAKE SURE EVERYONE WAS SAFE, ASSIST THE FIRE DEPT WHEN THEY ARRIVED, DIRECT ALL INQUIRES FOR INFORMATION FROM ANYONE OTHER THAN FIRE OR POLICE PERSONNEL TO ME.  ALSO TO CALL ME BACK IN FIFTEEN MINUTES WITH AN UPDATE ON THE SITUATION THERE.  AT 10:00 A.M., I CALLED THE MOBILE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND SPOKE TO EVERETT MILLER TO ADVISE THEIR HAZMAT UNIT OF THE LEAK.  AT 10:17, CLARK CALLED FROM THE MOBILE DEPOT TO SAY TREATED THE LEAK HAD BEEN SHUT OFF, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS THERE AND THEY WERE FILLING OUT PAPERWORK.  CLARK STATED THAT THE LEAK HAD COME FROM THE SUPPLY PIPE TO THE SPEED PUMP.  CLARK FURTHER STATED THAT HE WAS DRIVING THE BULK TRUCK OUT OF THE DEPORT, WHEN UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM THE SIDE GATE FROM HIS TRUCK FELL DOWN AND CAUGHT THE FILL HOSE FROM THE SPEED PUMP.  THIS CAUSED THE HOSE TO BECOME ENTANGLED IN THE REAR WHEELS OF THE TRUCK AND THIS PULLED ON THE HOSE WHICH PULLED ON THE SPEED PUMP, WHICH PULLED ON THE 1 1/2 SUPPLY PIPE FROM THE RECEIVER TO THE SPEED PUMP AND BROKE THE PIPE. WE HAVE SPOKEN TO BOC ON SITE AT THE MOBILE DEPOT.  THE PRESSURE IN THE RECEIVER WAS 200 PSI.  BOC WILL FILL THE RECEIVER FOR US TODAY AND HAVE ONE OF THEIR SERVICE TECH'S MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS TO THE SYSTEM.  WE HAVE ADVISED THE DEPOT TO ENSURE THAT THE FILL HOSES ARE PROPERLY STORED WHEN LOADING HAS BEEN COMPLETED.
