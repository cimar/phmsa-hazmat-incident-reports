An oncoming tractor trailer traveling east lost control, striking an automobile, crossing the centerline and struck the Linde tractor trailer head-on.  The force of the impact resulted in the Linde trailer becoming detached from the tractor.  The trailer went over a guard-rail and rolled over down an embankment coming to rest on its side approximately 60ft from the roadway.  The tractor remained upright and came to rest against the guard-rail.  The wrecge was cleared from the roadway in approximately 12 hours.  The trailer remained at the crash site, was attended by a security person overnight,and was recovered the following morning    Due to the impact, the full trycock valve was knocked open and vented product for approximately 24 hours until the trailer was able to be recovered.  Due to the properties of Carbon Dioxide, the remining liquid in the trailer eventually sublimed to dry ice and ceased venting.  The  valve was able to be closed as the trailer was removed from the side of the mountain.    Both truck drivers perished in the accident.","The accident is still under investigation by the Pennsylvania State Police.

During movement of tank car GATX 60780, load, Hydrochloric Acid, crew members noted ""smoking"" originating from the top of the railcar.  Car was set out and isolated.      Emergency contractor Eagle SWS (Findlay, OH) performed an inspection later that morning in daylight hours, advising the OSECO 165# safety vent frangible disc had ruptured, as designed.  Further inspection by on-scene representatives of original customer PVS Chemical, noted the ruptured disc found by Eagle SWS personnel, was not in compliance with DOT Hazardous Materials Regulations, due to incompatibility.  The plastic film that is supposed to be affixed to the underside of the frangible disc to prevent product vapor/liquid from decomposing the disc while in use, was not present.  A new and compatible safety vent frangible disc, properly rated for the car, was used for replacement.      Car did not require extensive clean up due to heavy rains that were reported falling at the time of the incident, and proceding response.  Car was wiped down regardless, ph readings satisfied, and car forwarded onto original destination.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Consolidated Rail Corporation,US,

In doing so pulled over into the grass area. He then tried to pull back onto the highway and caught the curb. The truck then rolled over on it's right side.   Action taken: The Lafayette Haz-Mat team was notified. The Rayne city police were called to the scene along with the Louisiana State Police Haz-Mat Division.  The leakage occured due to when the tank rolled over and landed on it's side the ball valve on the christmas tree hit a root in the ground causing it to open an leak product.   The valve was closed by the outside contract people that was called to assist.   The duration of the leak was approximately 5 hours with the valve half open and the product flowing through the dirt that was caked up in the crash box area.

While arrangements were being made for a truck to truck transfer an IMTT Operator discovered liquid dripping from the bottom of the trailer compartment.  The IMTT Operator immediately placed a 5-gallon pail under the trailer to contain the drips.  The cause of the leak appeared to be with the internal compartment.  The second truck was brought over to the leaking truck and the entire contents was transferred to the second truck.,IMTT-Bayonne contacted the customer of the product to inform them of the incident. The customer subsequently contacted the transportation company and will address any mechanical or structural issues with the truck or related components to prevent recurrences.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,IMTT-BAYONNE LLC,US,

Vehicle rolled onto the drivers side as it went up the side of the mountain.  Rock and debris pierced the tank.  The unit then rolled back onto roadway resting on the passenger side.  The driver was taken via ambulance to nearest hospital.  114 barrels of crude oil spilled from the tank but did not penetrate beyond the surface of the road or nearby dirt.  All oil began to setup on the surface at the current temperature.  Cleanup efforts began immediately after the driver and truck were removed from the scene.  Worked with the Tri-County Health Dept. on remediation plans and approvals.  All cleanup was completed within a few days.  Final grading on the sides of the road took place within a week.,"We are currently awaiting the police report to determine what factors they believe led to the crash.  It appears that the driver was either distracted or was going to fast to negotiate the right hand curve in the road.  Flying J Transportation has monthly safety training for each driver.  We also have training programs in place that specifically address speeding and distracted driving, both of which the driver had been instructed on in the last 2 years.

THE IMPACTED AREA ON THE TRAILER FLOOR MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 4 FEET BY 6 FEET.  THE IMPACTED AREA ON THE ASPHALT MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 1 FOOT BY 2 FEET.  THE RESPONSE TEAM DONNED THE PROPER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND BEGAN CLEANUP OPERATIONS.  ALL THE RELEASED MATERIAL WAS RECOVERED AND PLACED IN THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER (BAG.)  APPROXIMATELY 200 POUNDS OF THE SULFAMIC ACID PRODUCT HAD BEEN RELEASED.  A FORKLIFT WAS THEN UTILIZED TO LIFT THE DAMAGED BAG AND PLACE IT INTO A NEW BAG.

All hoses and air lines, set at 20 psi, were hooked up to begin the unloading process. As product began to flow, a customer's employee noticed a small leak coming from the semi-permanent air line attached to a PVC coupling below the line valve. As he made the driver aware of the leak, the driver investigated the leak at which time the air line ruptured from the PVC coupler spraying the driver in the face. Approximately 35 gallons of material escaped the vessel onto the concrete loading area floor before equipment could be shut down to stop the release of material. Immediate clean up procedures took place with absorbent boom socks and pillows utilized. This immediate action prevented any material from entering storm drain or waterways.",This particular tank trailer will be sent directly to our repair shop to have all fittings inspected and replaced as necessary to avoid future incidents.

The crew notified the yardmaster on duty, Michael Majoue, and the switching yard was shut down.  Majoue notified the LA State Police, the New Orleans Fire Department, Port of New Orleans Harbor Police, the LA Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), and NOPB Assistant Bridge Supervisor Eric Stoulig.  Stoulig notified United States Environmental Services and requested that they come out to investigate.  The Louisiana DEQ, the New Orleans Fire Department, United States Environmental Services (USES), and several NOPB officials all responded to the incident.    The New Orleans Fire Department arrived on site at approximately 17:15 and determined that tank car UTLX 46518 was an empty residue car last containing a Class 3 Flammable Liquid NOS (Crude Sulfate Turpentine, Alpha-Pinene).  Although the car was venting residue gas, Fire Department personnel agreed that the car posed no immediate threat to the public and departed at 18:30.    USES personnel arrived on site at approximately 18:00.  Upon inspection of tank car UTLX 46518, USES determined that there was a faulty 2.5” vacuum relief valve on the tank car, causing the empty residue car to vent gases.  Kelsey Tamplain of USES made arrangements with the car’s owner to have Rescar replace the faulty valve the next day, May 4, 2010.    On May 4, 2010, John McCrossen of NOPB met with Kelsey Tamplain of USES and Theresa LoGuidice of the DEQ at 09:30 at the NOPB Cotton Warehouse Yard office.  While waiting for Rescar to arrive with the replacement valve for the tank car, USES personnel scrubbed the vapors with the use of a carbon drum.

The areas were power washed using the standard procedure to remove unburned propellant. These procedures failed to remove the colored material. The engineers determined that the colored resdue was iron oxide.    After the rocket motor case arrived at our facility in Clearfield, Utah for refurbisment the operators who clean the case for reuse had concerns about the colored residue and as a precaution samples were sent to our laboratory for evaluation. Laboratory tests determined the residue was unburned solid propellant (TP-H1148, EX1982080002).    ATK technicians mechanically removed approximately 2 to 3 pounds of propellant and rubber liner which was transported to our Promontory, Utah facility for disposal. This rocket motor contains 273,164 pounds of propellant before it is launched.","Our corrective action to this incident is that should a questionable patch of material be found after lanunch and cannot be removed using our standard procedures Design Engineering will assess if propellant is present, additional pressure washing will be applied. If the material is not removed by pressure washing it will be removed by manual excision prior to shipping the post fire rocket motor cases back to Utah.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,ATK Launch Systems Inc.,US,

The conductor then proceeded to walk back and make a cut behind the Crude Oil cars in order to spot these cars at the American Refining Crude Rack Track.  Upon arriving at car GATX 300576, the conductor noticed that this car was leaking from the top dome.  He stated that the leak was occurring in drips from multiple locations around the dome.  Given the conductors perceived magnitude of the leak, he called 911, notified the northbound approaching train to stop safely short of the area and then reported the incident to the dispatcher.  The dispatcher then notified CHEMTREC as well as all necessary BPRR management.  This car was loaded with Petroleum Crude Oil.  Local fire responded and contained the spill with buckets and pads until responders from American Refining were present.  American Refining responded with a pump truck and pumped off enough product to relieve pressure in the tank and stop the leak.  The car was then spotted at the Crude Rack for unloading.  The car was later inspected by local FRA agent Timothy Rowan at which time he concluded that the car leaked as a result of being over filled and that a ""slight Manway Gasket tear was detected in the area of the hinge possibly as a result of over tightening of the Swingbolts"".",,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Buffalo & Pittsburgh,US,

Conrail emergency response contractor REACT Environmental Services, Inc., was called to respond to effect securement and any remediation.  Inspection by REACT noted the leak originating from underneath the protective housing.  Seal #025817 was removed and housing cover opened.  Leak originating from the threaded 3"" liquid valve where it was threaded into the valve's 4-bolt mounting plate.  Attempts to tighten the threaded valve with varying size pipe wrenches proved unsucessful.  Evidence of thread damage due deterioration and old teflon-like tape and/or pipe thread dope was noted.    Internal pressure reduced through air valve, and leak ceased.  Very high ambiant temperatures (in 90's) reported that day.  Further attempts made to tighten or remove valve to repair after car was vented down to ""0"", again, proved unsuccessful.  Reported any product that had been released had evaporated prior to contacting ground.  Magnetic float closed system gauging device read 10-1/2"" outage.  Car secured for evening.  Sunoco, Philadelphia, PA corporate inquired to FRA if movement approval would be required to move the car from its current location (yard located next to neighborhood), and FRA replied no movement approval required, citing Section 174.50 of Title 49, CFR.    May 26, 2010.  Customer notified of car's condition and gave approval to have car moved into the plant at first opportunity so it could be placed at the unloading rack.  REACT representatives re-inspected car and noted similar small release the following day, due to ambiant temperature and internal pressure increase.  Car vented down again; new protective housing seal ""REACT 002323"" applied to protective housing, and car was moved by Conrail crew to original destination (an approximate 1-mile move).  REACT escorted car while in transit, and no further leakage/exceptions noted.  Car placed at customer unloading rack at approximately 2PM.

May 27, 2010: At approximately 315am, CR Trainmaster D. Robertson reported car leaking in heavy streams at A-end of car, near the bottom, on the left side and down onto the body bolster.  CR emergency contractor REACT Environmental Services, Inc. contacted to respond, in addition to CR's Risk Management Department (N. Ferrone, Cheif Risk Officer, and A. Richter, Risk Manager-Hazardous Materials).    Upon arrival and inspection, heavy, multiple streams of product confirmed originating from behind the tank car's jacket, at the A-end corner, just outboard from the side and truck bolster.  Later estimate by REACT during vaccuming process during transfer determined leak rate at approximately 40 gallons an hour.  Troughs placed under A-end truck to contain product release.  Camden City Fire Department, Camden County Hazmat and Camden County Environmental Health and Hazmat also on scene at onset of incident, but deeming low hazard of product, nil contaminent to ground area due review of shipper MSDS (product used as ground fertilizer in current state as shipped) and control of incident, all responding agencies made decision to depart scene.    Entire contents transferred into 4 compatible vacuum cargo trucks. During transfer of 2nd load from car, there was a significant decrease in the streams of releasing product.  After transfer was complete (loaded cargo tanks returned product to original shipper, DuPont, Deepwater, NJ).  No further leakage from car.  Car was moved to #1 Heavy track in Pavonia Car Shop area.  Effected area on 18-Support was scraped and cleaned.  Based on information obtained from shipper, the heavy rains occurring in the area would neutralize any remaining product not captured (ph of product in raw state is 6.8-7.5).  Concentration displayed on MSDS supplied by shipper noted: Water: 69-85%; Ammonium Chloride: 15-31%; and, Isopropyl Alcohol: 0-0.3%).      May 28, 2010: REACT cleaned and purged/powerwashed inside of tank car.  Internal inspection conducted and noted multiple areas of shell pitting, corrosion and the suspected area of leakage noted cracking.

The loader overloaded compartment #2, which has a capacity of 1,000 gallons. The loader then turned off the pump and closed the railcar. Approximately 60 gallons was captured in two catch pans with an additional 30 gallons impacting the asphalt. Absorbent and sand was used to dam and dike. The remaining product was placed in a drum for disposal.",Awareness Items - 1. Outage alarm probe was in the appropriate trailer compartment but was not turned on. 2. Spill pans were placed under the overflow tubes in the back of the trailer; the overflow tubes in the front were missed and had no spill pans underneath them.    Root Causes - 1. The loader neglected to turn the outage alarm probe on before inserting it into the false dome lid on the trailer. 2. The loader was not situated at the top of the platform to closely monitor the meter.    Corrective Actions - 1. Verifier will ensure that the loader turns on the probe prior to it being placed in the dome. 2.

Employee was in Third gear as he approached the intersection with Steward and Gray Road.  Employee depressed the clutch pedal and applied foot pressure to the brake pedal and did not get a response.  The truck continued forward as employee was approaching the Stop sign.  Employee witnessed a car traveling NB ion Stewart and Gray Rd. and was afraid that he was going to collide with it.  To avoid a collision with this vehicle he tried to turn his truck into the NB lane.  This turn caused Employee to lose control of the truck and it rolled over onto its left side.  Some liquid lines were damaged in the incident.  The Fire Department evacuated the area and did not allow Ferrellgas to approach the vehicle until approximately nine hours had passed.  When Ferrellgas was allowed to approach the vehicle Ferrellgas transferred the propane from the damaged vehicle to another vehicle.  The damaged vehicle was then up righted and towed.,"The company has a rollover prevention policy titled, ""SLIP OFF STAY OFF"" with cab posters and training reminders.  The idea is to bring the vehicle under control without attempting to radically change the path which can cause liquid load shifting and add to the potential for overturn.  After each such accident a committee reviews the investigative facts to determine whether the driver followed company safety practices and whether disciplinary actions are appropriate. Our employees receive recurrent training for defensive driving, proper backing techniques and how to prevent rollovers.

GATX 53875 was cordoned off awaiting inspection from BNSF contract responders. Air monitoring at GATX 53875's location was conducted by the contract responders and no airborne contaminants were detected. The contract responder reported the liquid stain traced back to the pressure relief device (PRD) atop GATX 53875. Spillage on the side shell was evaporating and no ground impact was noted. Assessment by the responder after all valves and fittings were inspected concluded that GATX 53875 was possibly overfilled. On 5/29/2010, GATX 53875 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard for the contract responder to off-load a portion of the contents within GATX 53875 into a vac-truck. Approximately 1000 gallons was removed and placed into the vac-truck without incident. Afterwards, observed outage levels via the manway of GATX 53875 was acceptable at 13 inches. Commodity stain residue at the PRD and on the tank shell was wiped. The commodity in the vac-truck was delivered to the consignee for unloading. Intact seals at the manway closure, valve housing cover and the bottom outlet valve were replaced by seals numbered 000708, 000709 and 000799.

BY THE TIME THE EMPLOYEE REACHED THE MANUAL SHUT OFF VALVES ON TOP OF THE RAIL CAR A QUANTITY OF SULFURIC ACID HAD OVERFILLED THE TRUCK TRAILER AND SPILLED ONTO THE CONTAINMENT AREA.  ONCE THE FLOW WAS STOPPED THE TRUCK AND TRAILER WERE HOSED OFF WITH WASH WATER WHICH ALSO DILUTED THE SULFURIC ACID.  THE SULFURIC ACID WAS THEN NEUTRALIZED WITH SODA ASH.  THE QUANTITY OF ACID SPILLED WAS 148 GALLONS AS CALCULATED BY THE NUMBER OF 50 POUND BAGS OF SODA ASH ADDED TO BRING THE ORIGINAL ACID SOLUTION TO PH 7.0.  THE NEUTRALIZED SOLUTION WAS THEN PUMPED INTO A SECONDARY HOLDING TANK FOR FINAL REMOVAL.

TAMMY HUFF,SAFETY DIRECTOR,,,,,Carrier,"Driver hooked up trucks pump on the off-side of truck to the above ground tank, came around and checked pump on the driver side of truck to make sure cap was secure.  Driver turned on the PTO and pumped approximately 1,000 gallons of product off the tanker and felt comfortable with the operation and entered the truck to bump up the pumpspeed.  Driver noticed that the motor on the truck relaxed.  Driver looked around and saw that product was coming out of the pump on the driver side.  He immediately shut down the PTO, shut down the truck, could not get to the emergency shut-off valve for the product coming out of the pump so he ran around the truck and shut down the valve handles to stop the flow of product.  The cap on the driver side of the pump had vibrated loose and pressure caused it to blow off.  The driver had secured it with a double-eye hook.  One side of the hook had a quarter inch opening in it and the dog ear ring worked through the opening and allowed the cap to open up and blow off.  When product flow stopped personnel working on site began to dam up the product and also began to dump gravel and lime mixture to soak up the product.  The driver notified dispatch and home office of spill.  Home office immediately notified KY EPA, NRC and Weavertown Environmental for remediation and clean-up.","Follow up training was done with the driver.  Safety personnel discussed and made the decision to purchase new caps with locking mechanisms on them which will help eliminate the use of the double-eye hooks.

The driver placed a barrier around the spill for containment and safety.  Environmental Management Inc. (EMI) was contracted for cleanup.    The load consisted of only one hazardous waste manifest #006847034 JJK, it was a load of acids.  EMI contracted D & H Petroleum and Environmental for response to the small release.    D & H determined that the material had an acidic pH.  Upon opening the rear of the trailer they saw one drum with the lid partially open.  D & H speculated that the drum had pressurized causing the container to fail.  Further inspections found one drum lying on its side on the floor, with two additional drums next to it bulging.  D&H staff requested approval to mobilize a skytrack to the site to assist in the offloading of the drums so the floor of the container and the bottom of the pallets could be cleaned.  It is believed that 10-15 gallons was realeased to the trailer floor and 3-4 gallons had ran out of the back of the trailer onto the asphalt.  A notification of the spill was sent to NRC and TCEQ by EMI.  The asphalt was cleaned and power washed under the direction of TCEQ. The one 55-gallon poly drum with the failed lid closure was overpacked and two other closed top poly drums were vented since they were overpressured and were in danger of falling over due to their bottoms being bulged out.  The asphalt was power washed a total of three times until the pH of the rinsate became neutral.  All of the pads utilized to wipe down the two drums that were impacted, the floor, and the bottom of the pallets, were placed into four 55-gallon drums and one 14-gallon drum.  Plastic sheeting was placed beneath the drums/pallets as they were set on the asphalt parking lot during the cleaning process.  The plastic was placed into the five drums after all of the pallets had been reloaded.  All of the liquid captured from power washing the asphalt was placed into the same five drums.  All five containers were placed back onto the truck with all of the other drums and the manifest was adjusted to reflect the additional containers.",The 55-gallon drum that failed was only DOT rated for solids.  The drum was full of liquids.  It is possible that a vented bung is required to transport this material to keep the drums from being overpressurized during transport.,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Removable head plastic drum,1H2,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6750,SMITH SYSTEMS TRANSPORTATION,US,

He was loaded with 8500 gallons of gasoline. He traveled on Loop 323 to Hwy 110 South. As he approached the intersection, he observed traffic in both left turn lanes. He took the inside lane due to fewer vehicles. While at the red light, he saw another truck in the outside turn lane approximately three quarters of the way back of his trailer. When the light turned green, he proceeded to make his turn. He was still in low gear and could not have been going more than 15-20 MPH as he felt his tractor-trailer turning over. He got out of the truck and noticed there was damage to the other truck making the turn at the same time he was. The driver of the other truck approached our driver and neither was sure what caused our truck to turn over.   When the trailer hit the pavement, the #1 compartment (2600 gal. capacity) ruptured in a small area. Approximately 300 gallons of gasoline with 10% ETH was spilled from the compartment   The EMS, city police and fire department were on the scene immediately. The area was immediately evacuated and the fire department laid down Spagsorb and foam to contain the spill. The fuel that did spill was contained by a dam that was built by the first arriving engine crew. The other truck had a torn fuel tank and a small amount of diesel spilled from it. The tear in the tanker was plugged with a patch applied by TFD Hazmat. After the spill was contained and stopped the hazmat team called for a tanker to off load to and when it arrived the overturned truck was drilled and tapped by the hazmat crew. The gasoline was then offloaded into tanker The holes that were drilled were covered to control any remaining vapors and foam was applied during the entire operation to control vapor A wrecker was then called to upright the truck and trailer.","Even though we feel that our truck was clipped by the truck coming around him on the right side, we have taken steps to prevent any recurrences.   1.

CENTER ST.,",NORTH SALT LAKE,UT,84054,,"Note that the accident location is in Weston County, and although emergency responders came from both Crook and Weston Counties, it was Weston County officials who managed the response operations and retained jurisdiction over the incident.   The Maverik fuel transport truck was operated by a Maverik driver together with a driver trainee who was a passenger. Both men were taken to the hospital by ambulance for evaluation after the accident. Earlier in the day they had reportedly loaded the transport with unleaded fuel at the Wyoming Refining Sheridan terminal, where the typical amount loaded is reportedly 10,800 gallons. From the terminal, they apparently drove to Maverik store #165 in Gillette where they unloaded 5,999 gallons into the #3 unleaded tank as recorded by the Veeder-Root console at that store (see Veeder-Root records reproduced below). No other tank at that store showed an increase yesterday afternoon, and no delivery at all was recorded yesterday afternoon at store #282 also in Gillette. So, the transport still had on board 4,800 gallons yesterday when they left Gillette apparently bound for Newcastle. Of this total, 1,000 gallons was held by the trailer which did not overturn in the accident. The tank that was on the main truck chassis would have held the remaining 3,800 gallons. That tank became separated from the truck chassis when it overturned, and apparently all 3,800 gallons of fuel were spilled onto the ground.   After securing the accident scene, the emergency responders from Crook and Weston Counties addressed the fuel spill by using absorbent booms and pads, digging diversion ditches to keep the fuel contained, and placing stoppers in drainage culverts. The Weston County Emergency Manager is Doug Jorrey, and he said that these measures were successful to a large degree but that they were concerned that fuel had reached an adjacent stock-watering pond. Our insurer is Great West Property and Casualty, and they sent an investigator to the site from Rapid City, SD yesterday afternoon for an initial assessment. They also retained the services of an environmental consultant who will be coordinating additional response actions. Great West is taking an active environmental management and oversight role and so no additional effort on our part is needed.",MAVERIK SENT DRIVER TRAINER TO HELP TRAIN AND SUPPORT JERRY HAMMOND.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,59500,MAVERIK,US,
