Estimated approximately 3 cups of liquid or less based on size of dark spots on the floor and that the drums still appeared to be very full. Freight is alcohol so it had mostly evaporated only leaving a mark on the wooden floor of the cargo box, but no materials/puddles.","The consignee is a sister company to the shipper and the manager advised our driver that the freight should not be stacked more than 2 rows high, in this case there was a partial third row. The overpack was only shrink-wrap and the drums/wrap were not affixed to the skid in any way.

KIRK HIGBIE,DIRECTOR OF SAFETY & ENVIRONMENTAL,8934 MANCHESTER ST,HOUSTON,TX,77012-2149,Carrier,"At approximately 1935 hours on August 12, 2021 a PTRA train crew member reported product leaking from UTLX 213962 when the car was moved.  PTRA Operations manager on duty arrived on scene and noted that the product was flashing off/evaporating before it contacted the ground. He worked with the crew to slowly move the car into an isolation track for inspection and repairs. No further leakage or vapors were noticeable once the car was placed in the isolation track. On August 13, M&M Response was notified to inspect, repair and clean the car at the Manchester Yard.  Upon arrival on the scene M&M Response personnel found that two of six manway bolts were not applied, 1 of 6 bolts was hand tight and the remaining 3 of 6 bolts were tool tight.  The manway gasket was visibly pinched between the lid and manway nozzle prior to opening the lid. When M&M Response opened the manway they noted that the gasket was torn in half.  The gasket initially stuck to the manway lid but fell into the tank as the lid was opened fully.  M&M Response installed a shoulder type gasket to the manway nozzle, closed and secured the manway bolts to tool tight specs and applied a new seal.  They inspected the protective housing for any issues and found a loose, less than tool tight, liquid line plug. They secured the plug to tool tight specs and sealed the protective housing.  The exterior was then pressure washed.  The waybill indicated combustible liquid, the placards were 1993 flammable placards, after speaking with the shipper PTRA installed 1993 combustible placards on the car.  The waybill emergency contact information lists the CHEMTREC number with Tesoro Refining as the contact group. This is not a Tesoro shipment.    Chemtrec incident number is 2021081300115",PTRA Safety and Env Director spoke with Safety Kleen contacts and noted the cause of the leak and the issues with the waybill/placard information.  They are looking into the issues and taking steps to eliminate future occurrences.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,PORT TERMINAL RAILROAD ASSOCIATION (INC),US,

The US Ecology operator heard ""a noise"" that indicated something was not right with the tanker as he was preparing to leave the Plymouth Tube site. He pulled tanker 50020 over to a secure area to inspect it and found the knife valve for loading and un-loading had begun to leak.   Tanker 50020 had recently completed its annual inspections and repairs were made to the knife valve at local vendor, United Tank Parts Incorporated, 19300 Meginnity Street, Melvindale, MI 48122 (CT Registry #2732).   The operator used spill mats and buckets under the leaking valve. Site employees at the Plymouth Tube quickly built a containment berm while US Ecology operators that were on site offloaded tanker 50020 onto another tanker. Through the event, approximately 40 gallons released to the ground.","During a thorough investigation between United Tank Parts Incorporated and US Ecology, it had been discovered that United Tank Parts had installed the wrong, incompatible valve on to US Ecology cargo tanker 50020.

Upon closer observation, it was determined that the material was leaking from the drum at the bottom chime of the affected drum. This drum was over-packed and the leaked material was remediated and the material used to clean the area was included in the over-pack drum.",A thorough container inspection was conducted by the employee that originally accepted the drum from the generator.

They called the local trainmaster, who when investigating, noticed that the car was hissing from the top of the car as well as having an odor.  He called the Brewster Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis, WLE Hazardous Materials/Environmental Officer.  I came out to look at the car and found that both the liquid valves were leaking through the valve plugs.  I checked to see if the valve handles were loose and they were.  I tightened the handles on both valves and the leaks stopped.  I checked the valve plugs and both were less than hand tight.  I installed thread tape on the plugs and reinstalled them.  I also checked the plug on the vapor valve and it was loose.  I tightened it also but it was not leaking.  I removed old seal #6894136 from the Protective housing cover and installed new seal 971742.  The car was then OK for service.

They called the Mingo Yard Master who then contacted myself, John Vergis Hazardous Materials/Environmental Officer for the WLE.  I called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington, PA to look at the car.  When they arrived and investigated, the noticed that the manway lid was leaking from the handle area.  They opened the lid to find that the gasket was in good order.  What they found was, according to marks on the gasket, that the lid was not lined up properly to the manway nozzle.  This misallignment caused the metal surface of the manway nozzle to seal against the metal portion of the manway lid, not the gasket portion of the lid.  This caused the lid to not seal properly causing a slight liquid spillage as the car moved and also a vapor dispersion.  They reset the lid to the nozzle and tightened the lid appropriately.  The car was then returned to service.

After opening it and inspecting I see that the cans had slightly leaked from their tops/lids. Package was then immediately taken to the hazmat holding area for further processing. DescribePack: Since the bottom of the box was not wet it seems like the box may have been placed on its side and not upright with the orientation arrows. the leakage was very minor but it was enough to make the side of the box noticeably damp and the driver stated it was damaged. The cans inside were dented but its hard to tell if the cans were packed that way or if that happened in transit. The outer packing was fine. Nothing showing mishandling of any sort. There was also bubble wrap inside the box to help protect the 1-gallon cans.

QA retrieved the damaged hazmat using gloves, absorbent pads, and a plastic bag lined bin and transported it over to the QA Cage with a push cart. DescribePack: At first glance it was clear to see that there was a wet spot along the edge of the box and on the top of one side. After opening it up with a box cutter it appeared the leak was from the bottle of Concentrated Liquid Dishmachine Detergent and there were droplets surrounding where the cap was at. Most of the liquid is still in the bottle and there wasn't any damage along the body of the bottle either. Nor, was their evidence of a leak anywhere else on the box. DurationRel: 1 and MitigateEffect: As soon as the unload manager notified QA about the hazmat the package was immediately placed on a spill tray. I asked if it had spilled onto the floor and it had not. Since it is corrosive I put absorbent pads in the bin and then lined it with a thick plastic bag, and with gloved hands I put the package into the bin. From there we transported it to the QA cage where I inspected it further for any cracks, punctures, or damage of any kind while keeping the contents in the lined bin.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

He requested a team to inspect the leaking trailer and clean up any release. Mr. Girard contacted Young's Environmental Cleanup, Inc(YECI) in Grand Rapids, MI and requested a team to respond to the above incident. Mr. Girard stated that the team will need to unload the ftammable drums from the trailer and find the Ieaking drum. The team arrived onsite 1130 and began inspecting the trailer. The team layed out plastic to stage the pallets of drums for inspection. The team began removing the double stacked pallets from the trailer. The team found one drum slowly leaking from its bottom ring/chime. There was a slight dent in the area but no visual hole. The team overpacked the drum. The team inspected the remaining drums as well. There was no release to clean up because the released material had evaporated. The team estimated less than 5 gallons was released.
