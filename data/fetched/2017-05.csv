The BNSF dispatcher notified the NOC and SID to initiate a response.  BNSF Officers responded to the scene to meet with the Kingman/Yucca Fire HM team.  Safe access was provided to the car for the FD to assess.  BNSF also dispatched a Hazmat contractor from Phoenix, AZ and a BNSF Hazmat Responder from Needles, CA.  The car was found to have a leak coming from the liquid line on the car.  The Fire Department attempted to tighten the flange bolts and plug which slowed the leak significantly.  Once the contractor arrived on-site, the pressure was bled from the car and the flange was removed for cleaning/inspection.  The sealing area was found to be corroded and the gasket appeared damaged.  Responders cleaned the sealing surface, applied a temporary gasket and re-secured the car.  The car was neutralized using sodium bicarbonate and water, surfaces and the ballast were pH and found to be neutral after the cleaning process.  The car was inspected and allowed to travel to destination (approximately 16 miles from the siding location).",Shipper should ensure that all valves/fittings on cars are secured and leak free before placement into transportation.

The Great Falls Fire Department and Calumet responders also responded to assist.  The car was isolate, secured and employees removed from the area.  Hazmat responders determined that the car was leaking through the Pressure Relief Valve indicating an overload condition with the car.  Calumet responders helped to offload approximately 300 gallons of Naphtha from the car to create vapor space in the car to stop the release.  Residual Naphtha on the car quickly evaporated once the release was stopped.  Calumet removed the tote of removed naphtha and the car was then moved back to Calumet's facility for additional reduction and inspection.

Upon loosening the plug from the A-end liquid valve, the employees encountered a small amount of residual pressure behind the plug, which was bled off. Once that stopped, the employee loosened the valve plug by an additional two turns. There was an indication of more pressure behind the plug, upon discovery of which the employee immediately ceased loosening the plug. However, the plug was suddenly and violently forced out of the threads. The uncontrolled release of product lasted for approximately 7 hours. Businesses with 1/2 mile of the release were evacuated.

This tanker holds 2500 Gallons.    Upon safely filling the tanker it was scaled out and moved into our loaded line in our yard.  At 950am one of our tank farm employees noticed a leak spilling from the tanker 93.  The employee called for help and donned appropriate PPE, once help arrived the 1st employee began to investigate the leak.  He opened the outlet box on the tanker and found the internal, external and outlet cap open.  He closed the valves and the leak stopped.    Then the employee moved to the containment drain and put the cover over the drain.    A few minutes later it was decided that the spill was to large to clean up by our internal crew and the site security officer called 911 for Hazmat help and EnviroCare to come in and clean up spill.  The fire dept arrived and they closed 800 South and evacuated the building.  Once Envirocare came onsite at appx 1230pm the evacuated employees were allowed back into the building to gather their personal belongings and leave the area.    ENvircare cleaned up the spill with water.  The entire contents of the cleanup were contained in two liquid storage tanks.  The product will be disposed of correctly once profile is complete.",Investigation highlights:  Tanker just returned from testing and wash out.  when tankers are returned the valves are left open for drying  Evidence shows this is a employee error as he did not close the valves as per our training and checklist requires.  5 whys:  Procedure - Hazard overlooked.  Human - Complacent  Corrective action:  retrain all employees to the proper use of the checklist and to check all valves prior to and after filling.

The gasoline that did release, was completely consumed by the fire as well.","Due to the fatal injuries sustained by the driver, and nothing left of the tractor or tank trailer due to the fire, no interview could be conducted. Law enforcement cleared the driver of any Hours of Service violations for the previous 7 days, Driver Qualification Files and maintenance records were shown to be in compliance as well. The driver was very familiar with the delivery site and using this exit that accesses the delivery location. Given these facts, and the outcome of the accident, we can only speculate that the driver may have suffered some medical issue that impaired his physical ability to slow or stop the truck.

The driver was using an electric pallet jack to tailgate the freight.  He had successfully removed three totes to the back. On the final tote he was lowering the pallet jack to set the tote down when he accidentally bumped the forward button.  The jack lurched forward just enough to cause the front wheel to drop off the edge.  The tote slid off the pallet onto the ground. The tote fell approximately 4 feet to the ground and landed on its side.  The tub was ruptured and started leaking.  The personnel at the facility did not have enough supplies to contain a spill of this size but put down as much floor dry as possible to contain the spill.  The driver called the fire department was called and we were told they didn't have a haz mat crew and told him to call a professional clean up crew.  We contacted Veolia.  When our manager got on site, he called the fire department again and requested they come out.  They arrived and began containing the spill.  They attempted to turn the container over to put the split side up, but that caused the container to rip and gush out the rest of the solution.  The EPA and Veolia arrived and began the clean up.",We have informed our customer that we will no longer offload these tubs to parking lots and will only do dock to dock deliveries.

Forsyth Street, 7th Floor",Jacksonville,FL,32202,Carrier,Our driver was beginning the loading process when he reached for the loading facilities product loading line which included a blow down valve.  Our driver observed a small leak coming from that blow down valve.  He informed the facility's loading operator of the leak.  The operator questioned where the leak was coming from.  Our driver touched the blow down valve to show the operator the location of the leak.  The blow down valve separated from the loading line resulting in a spill of sulfuric acid. Even though our driver was fully attired in complete PPE he sustained chemical burns to his check and neck.    A post incident inspection was performed and determined that the blow down valve was misaligned which resulted in the internal threads being stripped.  The plant installed a new blow down assembly which eliminated the hazard.,Ensure the proper installation is performed on all equipment involved in the loading process at the loading facility.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Florida Rock and Tank Lines, Inc.",US,

The remaining leaked material was cleaned from the ground and inside of the trailer and properly disposed of.,"A number of failures were noted which led up to this release. A faulty internal process at the generator led to free liquid remaining in the filter cake. Further, the pallet used to transport the material was in poor condition which may have led to the puncture. The driver who originally transported the material admitted noticing the bag looked ""heavier"" than the others on the shipment but failed to act or notify management. the generator has instituted an improved process to more completely eliminate free liquids in their filter cake.

While in the process of verifying his remaining load and re checking the facility tank gauge some distance away, the facility tank was over filled. The original tank gauge reading was found to be incorrect. All of the released fuel oil was captured in containment, with no release to soil or water. A field service crew, equipped with the correct PPE, was dispatched to pump out the fuel oil from containment, and fully degrease and remediate the containment structure.

THE TANK IS LOCATED INSIDE A CONCRETE CONTAINMENT AREA. THE TANK MEASURES 87” IN DIAMETER AND IS 89’” THE TANK WAS FILLED TO 2,000 GALLONS. AFTER THE DRIVER DISCONNECTED THE FILL HOSE HE NOTICED A SMALL AMOUNT (FEW OUNCES) OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE SPILLED OUT OF THE FILL LINE ON THE GROUND AFTER THE DRIVER STARTED THE FILL HOSE ON HIS TANKER, HE NOTICED THAT SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE BEGAN RUNNING OUT OF THE FILL LINE ON THE GROUND. THE DRIVER THEN CUPPED THE END OF THE FILL LINE TO STOP THE LEAK. BASED ON A DROP OF AN INCH OR SO IN THE TANK LEVEL, WE ESTIMATE THAT 30 GALLONS WAS SPILLED. THE CITY OF WINTER HAVEN WATER PLANT EMPLOYEE TOLD THE ODYSSEY DRIVER TO GO AND HE WOULD REPORT THE INCIDENT TO HIS MANAGEMENT AND DO ANY CLEANUP AND ANY OTHER REQUIRED ACTIONS SINCE THE CITY OF WINTER HAVEN WAS THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY FOR IT’S TANK AND PROPERTY (AND NOT ODYSSEY).","WHAT APPARENTLY HAPPENED IS THAT THE NEWLY INSTALLED FILL LINE DROPS DOWN INTO THE TOP OF THE TANK AND DOES NOT HAVE A VALVE ON THE END.

The area was immediately isolated and operations in the general area where suspended while the response and investigation was occurring.  Four Anhydrous Ammonia cars were found to be together in the yard and the inspection focused on these cars given the location and details from the crew.  The Spokane Fire Hazmat Team, BNSF Hazmat Team and contract responders arrived on-scene.  The Fire Department initiated air monitoring at the BNSF property boundary and at nearby residences, no ammonia odor was identified and no monitoring readings were observed.  BNSF Hazmat and contract responders inspected the four cars and found the ACFX 220507 with a very small leak detected with air monitoring equipment in the protective housing.  No odor or air monitoring results were observed at ground level.  The leak was found to be originating from between the vapor valve and pressure plate.  2 of 4 valve flange bolts were tightened by less than 1/8 of turn and the leak stopped as verified by air monitoring (gastech tubes and PID).    Later in the day on 5/30/17 while the car was being moved within yard limits, yard crews reported an ammonia odor coming from the car.  The area was again isolated and responders were dispatched to the yard.  The leak was again found to be coming from the vapor valve flange.  The flange bolts were not able to be tightened any further.  It was determined that the car would need to be transferred and vapor removed from the car.  Preparations were made to transfer the car and control vapors by vacuum through water until pressure was removed the car.  The car was transferred on 5/31/17 with cleaning and purging occuring between 5/31/17 and 6/2/17.  The car was then transported to shop under an OTMA-3 provided by CF Industries.    The release volumes indicated in this report are estimates only and based upon observations during the response, the gauging device on this car was disabled and volume measurements were not available during this incident.  The root cause of the release is not known at this time, it will be investigated by the car owner/lessee.",The yet to be completed root cause determination will ultimately determine what further actions should be taken.,No,TANK CAR,,112J340W,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,130000,BNSF Railway Company,US,
