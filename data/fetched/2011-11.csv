The car was isolated and the shipper, Heritage Crystal Clean, local and state agencies were notified, CHEMTREC report 2011-11-04-00173. Summit Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found all of the manway cover swing bolts not employed, hanging down. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Sharon Lainio 708-712-1577. Summit Environmental personnel verified the manway gasket alignment and tightened all the manway securement bolts stopping the leak.The spilled product obscured all the stencils and markings on the car therefore the shipper contracted with ERS to clean the car before forwarding in transportation.

This end of the right front axle then dug into the soft turf of the right shoulder of the roadway causing the first nurse trailer to flip over and roll on the tank into the road ditch.  The second trailer followed into the ditch, remaining upright with only minor damage to the trailer tongue and no damage to the tank.      During the rollover, when the protection device for the 3/4"" pressure relief valve contacted the ground, it bent; allowing the pressure relief valve to also contact the ground, resulting in a 1/4” long crack in a pipe thread at the base of the valve.  Liquid ammonia also surged out of the pressure relief valve, with the valve failing to reclose entirely.  The tank came to rest on its left side, releasing liquid ammonia from the cracked pipe thread and the 3/4” pressure relief valve.  The liquid ammonia immediately vaporized with the help of the NW 25 to 30 mph winds and the 50°F temperature.  At approximately 1345 hrs., using a front end loader, the nurse tank was set upright and the leak then stopped.    The remaining product was transferred to another nurse trailer, emptying the damaged nurse tank.  Duration of the release was approximately 65 minutes.  With the high winds and favorable temperatures, all released product completely dissipated into the air.","It has been determined the failure of the axle spindle was the root cause of this incident.  To prevent reoccurrence, heavier axle spindles are being installed on these nurse trailers’ running gears.

When he arrived at his next customer in Ipswich, MA, he noticed the load securement strap had fallen off the drums causing one of the 4 drums to move and be damaged. The drum that leaked product was on its side in the back of his trailer with the cut on the side up where the drum sat in the trailer. Some product had leaking onto the trailer floor. The estimated product loss from the drum was approx.- 4 gallons from the 55 gallon container once he was able to do a temporary repair. He was able to uses and to absorb the spill in the trailer. After he was able to return to the Sutton, MA terminal, the trailer was placed out of service and left to ventilate and a neutralizing product was used against the remaining H/M product in the wood floor. The disposal of the drum with remaining product and the neutralized H/M product will be disposed through New England Disposal Technologies, Inc. 83 Gilmore Drive, Sutton, MA.","Driver needs to use the load securement strap properly to the e-track to have secured drums. Ross driver has been given H/M training on 1/12/2009 & 10/3/2011 to be able to implement our company procedures with regard to company H/M spill response procedures. He was able to follow instruction from Ross Express's MA terminal manager to protect himself first and then keep anyone away from H/M spill location. He was instructed to get his bill of lading, notify the terminal manager what the H/M product leaking was and to what extent the leak was. He then was told to use his emergency response guidebook to be able to be on the same page as the terminal manager. The guide page number was 154. After this spill evaluation our employee was able to do a temporary repair safely. Proper load securement was made to all the drums in the back of his trailer including the repaired damaged drum.The drum then placed in a containment drum at the MA terminal preparing for its disposal with the spilled material/sand.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,ROSS XPRESS INC,US,

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected NATX 37037 removing intact shipper seal numbered 1271074 0003235 from valve housing cover. The responder observed the leak source at the base of the threaded 3 inch stainless steel closed liquid ball valve. This liquid valve appeared to be newly installed (likely installed when NATX 37037 completed its tank qualification in 2011). The responder tool tightened this valve on its threaded connection ending further leakage.  No ground impact from spillage was noted.  NATX 37037 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard for a detailed liquid valve inspection and cleaning of the spillage from its tank shell.   On 11/15/2011, contract responders removed and inspected the liquid valve's threaded connections. The responders reported no thread sealant applied on the liquid lines 2 inch threaded pipe nipple. Also, a 3 inch threaded bushing fitted on the 2 inch pipe nipple had little thread sealant applied.  The responders applied Teflon tape and thread sealant on all threaded connections. The 3 inch bushing was secured on the pipe nipple and the liquid valve was re-installed and properly tool tightened. Spillage on the tank shell was treated with a degreasing solution and then wiped.

Intact shipper seal identified as KAAPA Ethanol 0000345 was removed from the valve housing cover during this inspection process. UTLX 204372 was carefully moved to and isolated at a repair track within the railyard. A response contractor was notified to inspect UTLX 204372 and mitigate the liquid valve leak. In the morning of 11/18/2011, UTLX 204372 was inspected by the response contractor. The 3 inch liquid valve was loose on its threaded connection by 1/8 of a turn. A small puddle of product at the base of the liquid valve that didn't evaporate was wiped. It was decided to remove the liquid valve to inspect the valve's threaded connection. Sealant found on the threaded connection was sparse and dry. The threaded connection was cleaned and Teflon thread tape applied with an overcoat of thread sealant compound. The liquid valve was reinstalled and properly tool tightened. As a precaution, the two inch threaded air valve  was removed, threads cleaned, new sealant tape and thread compound applied before reinserting and tool tightening the air valve. The valve housing cover was closed and seal TIS 5835 applied. Response was concluded by 1245 hrs. MST, 11/18/2011.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Goodyear Tire +Rubber Co., was notified via CHEMTREC report number 2011-11-18-00031. Pettit Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the liquid line valve plug was not tight. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative. Pettit Environmental tightened the plug with a pipe wrench and the leak stopped. The liquid line valve was not in the closed position. The leak was secured and the car was released for transportation to destination.     This incident did require a special switch move.   A QA 7.1 Non conformance report will not be required for this incident    A charge for switching the car is required.

Rail car inspections by BNSF contract responders resulted in the identification of residue tank car UTLX 58835 as the odor source. Further inspection of UTLX 58835 revealed that the odor was emanating from the vacuum relief valve (VRV). The VRV was removed and a pipe plug was inserted and tool tightened into the vacated VRV orifice. The odor quickly dissipated and ceased after response concluded by approximately 1610 hrs. CST, 11/20/2011.  Visual inspection of the removed VRV revealed that the VRV's weather cap under the stem nut was bent to one side which may indicate that the VRV valve stem was bent also. The VRV's O-ring at the stem base appeared pinched and misaligned.

Our driver was traveling west on Airline Hwy (Hwy 61) in Laplace when the driver of a 2005 Chevy Malibu decided to make a U-turn and side swiped our truck, hitting the passenger side steer tire through the fender, saddle tank, loading heads/ piping, and into the front drive tire.  The impact cracked two of the u-clamps on the #3 and #4 compartments spilling approximately 20 gallons of Diesel from the piping onto the Hwy and shoulder, sand was quickly delivered to contain the spill and absord Diesel.

Immediately after this notice we checked the most recent trailer that arrived which was from the Bronx Facility.  Upon opening the trailer door, there was a 17 gallon sharps container that fell causing the lid to break which spilled out numerous blood vials.  The inhouse clean up team then went up the block to clean up the blood vials that were reported.  In addition, the inhouse clean up team was instructed to go to the Quickway Gas Station located at 195 County Hwy 48 where the trailer last stopped to fuel.  Blood vials were also found and cleaned up at the Quickway Gas Station.  Following this the inhouse clean up team checked the roadways leading to the plant.  More blood vials were found and cleaned up at the I-88 overpass in Otsego.  In total 22-5ml blood vials were found and clean up.     During this time the Bronx inhouse clean up team was sent to check the roadways leading to I-87 which is the route taken to the Plant for any blood vials.  No blood vials were found, therefore this spill was an isolated event that took place between the Quickway Gas Station to the Plant in Otsego County.       The trailer which the spilled occurred from was also inspected for containment defect.  No issues were found; there were no holes or breach of containment and all locks/seals were in place and operational.",All affected employees were retrained on proper load securement and use of racks for all sharps containers which would have prevented this situation from occurring.  The employee directly responsible for loading and securing the 17 gallon sharps container was suspended in addition to being retrained.  As an added precaution the trailer door seals will be replaced with larger seals to accommodate for normal door shifting during transportation.,No,BOX,"Box, wood or fiberboard not specified",BOX,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Stericycle Inc.,US,

Upon arrival it was discovered that the pallet the transformers were secured to collapsed and the strapping holding the transformers became loose. This allowed the transformers to tip side to side during transportion.  The shifting between the transformers loosened the lid and damaged the bushings attached to the transformer. This resulted in PCB contaminated oil spilling from the transformer. The vehicle being used to transport the transformers was equipped with a secondary containment system and all oil was confined to the secondary containment. Although contained the other packages in the shipment also became contaminated with PCB contaminated oil. These packages as well as the transport trailer had to be decontaminated prior to being released from the site. All containers and the vehicle were decontaminated in accordance with the EPA requirements for PCB contaminated oil spills. Contaminated material was added to the manifest and resumed shipment to Phoenix for final disposal in accordance with the PCB rules.,"Retrain employees on the proper handling methods when preparing PCB pole transformers for transportation including:    1.Package oil filled electrical equipment within secondary containment.

By placing them inside the drum with floor dry to secure against movement, even if a leak occurs, the released material would not affect the transport vehicle or other containers.    2.For larger transformers and equipment, drain the equipment prior to shipment and transport the oil in appropriate drums.     3.Do not load transformers on pallets. Because of the amount of metal contained within the transformers the weight per square foot is typically higher than that of a standard drum. As such, a standard pallet will not support the weight of the transformer. Whenever possible load the transformers directly on the floor.    4.Ensure that the transformers are secured against movement while in transport.   5. Protect bushings and other projections on transformers from damage.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1300,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at Clean Harbor’s in transit storage facility in order to consolidate less than truck load quantities onto a single transport vehicle for continued transportation.  While in storage pending continued transportation, an inspection of the containers identified that four (4) individual containers had failed allowing material to escape onto the floor of the trailer and asphalt dock area.  Facility personnel assembled a response team and after donning appropriate personal protective equipment, entered the trailer.  Upon further inspection, it was discovered that the 4 containers failed along a side seam.  The response team placed each of the 4 containers into suitable salvage containers and used a chemically compatible absorbent material to absorb all free liquids.  This material, along with materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and placed into the salvage drums and are being monitored to insure additional pressure does not develop before the containers are placed back into transportation.","At the time the containers were accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking or damage was observed.  It is believed that during storage, pressure built up in the containers causing the seam to fail.  We do not believe that pressure alone caused the containers to fail as the failure along the seam of each of the 4 containers appeared to be a non violent seam failure.  In order to prevent a recurrence, we are reviewing the waste stream to identify what may have caused the over pressurization and to take appropriate actions to insure continued transportation is incident free.  In addition, we have contacted the container manufacturer to inquire if they have received any similar reports of seam failures involving involving this type of containers.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,PR,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1100,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

The connection between the railcar and the product fitting had a loose bolt which resulted in a release of approximately 3-4 gallons of product when the car started to pressurize. The product impacted the side of the railcar, the track ballast and blacktop. Lime was applied to neutralize the product. After neutralization the lime was placed in a bucket for proper disposal.  -    AWARENESS ITEM:   1. Both the Loader and Terminal Manager are unavailable to assist in the investigation.     2. The Loader was employed for approximately 3 months and has performed this transfer numerous times without incident.     3. At the time of the incident, the Loader complained of migraines.","ROOT CAUSES:  1. During setup, the Loader failed to ensure the security of the railcar fittings.     CORRECTIVE ACTION:   1.

ERTS dispatched an environmental crew to perform cleanup operations and to also perform a tanker transfer. Upon the environmental contractor's arrival it was reported that the local hazmat team had already began the tanker transfer. The environmental contractor assisted with the tanker transfer and reported that approximately 1 gallon of material was released from the dome lid on the damaged tanker. The tanker transfer was completed successfully. The environmental contractor hand excavated the area of contaminated soil that was affected by a 3 gallon diesel fuel release and containerized all of the waste for transportation and disposal. The wrecker service uprighted the tractor tanker and hauled it off site. The 1 gallon of material released from the tanker evaporated and no cleanup was necessary for that material released.

AS FAR AS THE STAP GIVING AWAY, WE FELT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO STAY WITH SKID SPACERS WHEN SPREADING OUT A LOAD, INSTEAD OF USIN THE STRAPS AS WELL.  HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF USIN A ""FALSE WALL"" IT IS RECOMMENDED TO USE A MINIMUM OF 2 STRAPS AT THE SAME SPOT TO GIVE ADDITIONAL STRENGTH AND AS A ""BACKUP"".

The system is set up so that fuel can be discharged on either the driver or passenger side of the tanker truck through a T-shaped pipe.  The fuel was being transferred to a 10,000-gallon aboveground tank on the driver's side but the operator failed to close off the proper valve on the passenger side piping.  The pressure built up in the line and eventually forced the end cap off the pipe resulting in the release.  Overall, the cause of the releae was due to human error.    The following corrective actions took place immediately after the release occurred: The release was contained within a confined area using on site sand placed with a front end loader.  The free product was then pumped into four 55-gallon drums using a small portable pump and absorbent was used to soak up the remainder of the free product not absorbed into the soil.  These corrective actions took place on Monday, November 21, 2011.  The contaminated soil was excavated by Papco, Inc.'s subcontractor (Tidewater Utility)on Tuesday, November 22, 2012 and seven dump truck loads of contaminated soil were removed and properly disposed of at Clearfield MMC on that same day.  The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality's Tidewater office visted the site and on November 28, 2011 approved the clean-up with no further actions required.",The corrective actions taken to help prevent recurrences of this situation include the follwoing:  The fuel delivery employee has been counseled on what he did wrong and has been disciplined.  The issue was thorughly discussed at the Papaco driver safety meeting to insure that future repeat occurrences do not happen.

Reported amount of release was one barrel.    Cause:  Driver Wayne Mingo while loading light crude violated company policy when he entered his cab and reported to us that he fell asleep. Mr. Mingo failed to monitor his loading as required. Root cause, driver error.    Response and Recovery:  Chris Pace and a crew arrived and started the clean up process. A vacuum truck was obtained from Breitbum and our crew started pressure washing the asphalt parking lot in the area. Patriot Environmental sent a rep to the location for evaluation of this process.    Although the parking area was cleaned the following day I went along with John Miller to view the area. I was noted that a small amount of product had sipped into a creek bed, it was also determined that this creek had natural seepage and we could not determine new contamination and old contamination. A meeting was scheduled  for Friday with environmental specialist and Breitbum Management to discussfurther clean up requirements.    The following is a list of who attendant this meeting.    •Dave Palmer- Pan Pacific Petroleum  •  Don Stewart- Pan Pacific Petroleum  •  Dale -Patriot Environmental  •  Edward Quinones- Production Foreman Breitburn  •  Michael Joseph- Environmental Health & Safety Breitburn  •  Brian Jngallinera- Environmental Services City of Brea  •  Donald Barkley- Barkley Environmental Engineering Services  •  Cory Kong- Environmental Scientist Department ofFish & Game     It was detennined  that the creek had previous contamination prior to our spill. Recommendations from the Department ofFish & Game was that we remove a small area of contaminated soil leading to the creek and surrounding area. Also noted was vegetation around the berm that containing over-spray from the pressure washing needed to be removed, mainly consisting to fallen leaves and dead grass.    Patriot Environmental preformed this cleanup and the area was cleared by Fish and Game at 1500. Pending issue with Breitburn Management is what to do about the stained asphalt? Dave asked from them to call when a decision was made.    * NOTE ON CREEK BED, IT COULD NOT BE DETERMINED THAT OUR SPILL MADE IT INTO THIS CREEK. THIS AREA HAD PRE-EXISTING CONTAMINATION DUE TO NATURAL SEEPAGE OF OIL IN THE AREA.",Recommendations:    Driver was charged with failing to follow proper pump procedures. Mr. Mingo will be  terminated for his actions. Safety meeting was scheduled the following day to discuss this accident and review our loading and unloading procedures.

Facility personnel responded to the release by applying 25 bags of Oil-Dri absorbent to the ground surface.  Apex mobilized to the site to remove the Oil-Dri and excavate any additional impacted material identified from the release.  The Oil-Dri was removed and placed in two 55-gallon steel drums for proper disposal.  Apex used a skid steer loader to remove impacted soil and gravel from the site and the adjoining Roanoke Cement Plant property.  All excavated material was placed in four 55-gallon steel drums.  Apex returned to the site on November 22, 2011 and repaired the excavated areas with clean stone.

Washington Blvd.,Bartlesville,OK,74006,"Other-Carrier, Shipper and Fac","On November 7, 2011 at approximately 6:05pm, a CRCT driver started unloading crude oil from his trailer and prior to completion of the process noticed crude oil coming out of a valve on the passenger side of the trailer.  The driver immediately turned off the pump and shut the discharge valve and then contacted the Bartlesville Office Dispatch Supervisor.   Upon release notification, at approximately 6:25 pm, CRCT response personnel were immediately mobilized to the site with containment boom, absorbent boom, boat, 2 vacuum trucks, 1 transport truck/trailer, and a backhoe.  After initial assessment (approximately 7:40pm) CRCT response personnel strategically placed containment and absorbent boom on the dry unnamed creek approximately 50’ downstream of pooled crude oil. Response personnel began to utilize vacuum trucks to remove the free crude oil from the pooled areas within the otherwise dry unnamed creek bed.  Response personnel also began constructing an underflow dam to prepare for an impending rain event forecast for the area.  At the time of the initial response there was no water in the unnamed creek.  As the bulk of free oil was being removed from the pooled areas the rain event began causing water to flow down the unnamed creek.  Due to the excessive downpour during the rain event, the underflow dam and containment boom washed out allowing an estimated five (5) barrels of unrecovered crude oil to be washed downstream towards Skiatook Lake.  CRCT immediately called the National Response Center (at 9:25pm) when it was apparent that the release would ultimately reach Skiatook Lake.  ACME Products Company was also contacted to assist in the response.  ACME arrived on-site at approximately 10:00pm and began to survey the lake for access areas for additional containment boom placement.  A containment boom was placed across the cove where the unnamed creek entered Skiatook Lake.  Response efforts in the following days concentrated on recovering crude oil from behind the boom across the cove and cleaning up the oily debris along the unnamed creek.   Recovery efforts were essentially completed by November 23, 2011.  Absorbent booms and pads and the downstream containment boom were left in place until December 21, 2011 to address any residual oil. During the week of January 1st, 2012 the United States Army Corp. of Engineers (USACE) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) conducted an inspection of the affected area and documented that clean-up efforts had been completed to their satisfaction.
