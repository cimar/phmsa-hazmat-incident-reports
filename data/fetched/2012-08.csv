Approximately 1/2 gallon of material was released to the trailer floor from a tote onboard. ERTS is coordinating a response with a network contractor and will provide an ETA once made available.    8/16/2012 1:23:38 PM The contractor is onsite at this time and will begin investigating the release momentarily. ERTS has notified the California Emergency Management Agency and were assigned report number 12-4837 to this incident.     8/16/2012 2:14:11 PM The contractor has reported that two totes containing the UN 2810 product have leaked a minimal amount of material to the trailer floor and sides of the totes. The contractor has reported that the totes seem intact and do not need to be transferred but they will offload them to inspect them more closely. The contractor will then secure the caps and perform the necessary cleanup with absorbents and absorbent pads.     8/16/2012 4:47:01 PM The contractor has reported that the leaks were due to missing gaskets and faulty caps on the totes. The contractor has completed the necessary cleanup and resecured the caps and new gaskets on first tote. The contractor has partially finished the cleanup of the second tote but they need to offload it in order to complete the proper cleanup and resecure the cap and new gaskets.     8/16/2012 5:50:22 PM The contractor has completed the cleanup at this time and is departing the site.

Critical Incident Desk was notified and Response Team was activated. Responders found the cause of the release to be loose manway swing bolts.    Description of Events:  * No injuries reported    File Note Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels.They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

The terminal is owned by TRANSFLO Terminal Services, Inc (TRANSFLO), and operated by KMMS. The release occurred during a railcar to truck trailer trans-load at approximately 10:35 a.m. on  August 2, 2012. The release was discovered by KMMS operator, David McKenzie, who was in charge of the transfer. Mr. McKenzie was scheduled to transfer 1,400 gallons of solvent naphtha into a 1,500 gallon compartment on the truck trailer via metered platform pump. The release of approximately 200 gallons was due to a failed alarm on the high level probe. The alarm had been inadvertently turned off during a training exercise. The operator was standing approximately 25 feet away from the platform pump discussing transloading operations to a trainee at the time of the release. The release occurred through the dome opening on the truck trailer, down the side of the trailer to impervious asphalt. Once the release was visually observed coming down the side of truck trailer the KMMS operator quickly ascended the platform and shut the transfer down. Mr. McKenzie called a code yellow (chemical release) and terminal employees responded to dam and dike the released solvent naphtha with Absorbal®. Although no reportable quantity was exceeded nor any storm drains or waterways impacted a call was placed the NRC as a best management practice at the request of TRANSFLO. The estimated release volume of 200 gallons was based upon the response time of the operator to shut down the pump (1.67 minutes) and the flow rate of the pump(120 gallons / per minute). A call was placed by KMMS Customer Service Representative, Ms. Cindy Hunsberger, at 10:55 a.m. to the Carolina Emergency Response Team (CERT), a private emergency response company based in Charlotte, NC to clean up the released solvent naphtha. CERT arrived at the terminal at 11:20 a.m. and properly cleaned the spilled material.  Mr. Jeff Mitchell from the Mecklenburg County, NC, Department of Environmental  Protection, Water Division, arrived at the terminal to inspect the release site at 1:05 p.m. and was satisfied with the response and clean-up and that no waterways were impacted.","KMMS is working on corrective measures to prevent reoccurrence including modifying  our operator training program and installing a metered pump that automatically shuts-off at the desired set volume. KMMS is requesting the metered pump from our customer who supplies the required transfer equipment.

The splashed BNSF employee was on the ground near UTLX 200541 and immediately washed off impacted skin area. Afterwards, further water washing/decontaminating was initiated by responding EMS personnel. The BNSF employee sustained no reportable injuries. Apparently, unattended UTLX 200541 was in the process of being unloaded by the consignee (Trimac Transportation Services). The manway cover and the liquid line were not secured. Only one of eight manway securement bolts were applied and the liquid line's blind flange closure connection was loose. Movement of UTLX 200541 during a coupling event resulted in the product being expelled from these unsecured top fittings. An unsecured unloading fitting attachment and an adjustable wrench were laying atop UTLX 200541. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder secured the manway closure and the liquid line blind flange closure and removed the unsecured unloading fitting and wrench from UTLX 200541.",Ensure consignee's unloading procedures include total securement of all valves and fittings if a hazardous material transportation package is unattended or not on-site monitored during its unloading process.,No,TANK CAR,,111A60W7,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Lauderdale TRANSFLO terminal was completing a liquid transfer of Ferric Chloride from a railcar to  truck trailer. A product hose was secured to the open dome lid of the trailer and the liquid Ferric Chloride was being splash loaded into the trailer. During the last part of the transfer, the operator was blowing the loading hose clean with air to force the remainder of Ferric Chloride out of the loading hose and into the trailer. As the operator was blowing back product hose into trailer, the pressure from the hose contacted the liquid product in the truck. The liquid level was approximately 4-6"" from the end of the product hose that was being blown clean. This sudden release of pressure from the hose cause the liquid in the trailer to splash upward and resulted in was a sudden upward spray of liquid Ferric Chloride from the open dome lid on the trailer. The Ferric Chloride that splashed out of the top dome lid on the trailer ran down the sides of the railcar. Approximately 5 gallons of  Ferric Chloride was released. No storm drains were impacted, but some ferric chloride impacted the soil when it mixed with large water puddles in the yard. The spilled material was cleaned up and properly disposed of.","This was a new additional carrier for this transfer. The regular carrier’s trailer is equipped with bottom load piping for loading where the operator can connect directly to the trailer's piping to utilize cam lock connections. A false dome lid or channel spout was not available for use for this transfer as the regular carrier’s trailer does not require them. Because the trailer was not equipped with bottom load piping to allow for bottom loading; and a false dome lid or channel spout was not available, the operator incorrectly decided to splash load the trailer by securing the product hose to the trailer dome lid. He secured the hose to the trailer by using rubber bungee cords. This was the direct cause of the product release. If a channel spout or false dome lid would have been utilized for this transfer, this incident would not have occurred as the spout or false dome lid would have prevented product from being splashed back out of the dome lid when the product hose was being blown clean.    ROOT CAUSES:   1.Lack of knowledge due to inadequate training of approved loading procedures.  2.Lack of skill due to inadequate review of loading procedures and instructions.  3.Inadequate leadership and/or supervision resulting in inadequate instructions, orientation, and/or training.    CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:   1.Knowledge and skill training: Review, train, and test all employees on the approved loading procedures for railcar to trailer transfers of Ferric Chloride.  2.Order a channel spout for Ferric Chloride transfers and require use of channel spout on all ferric chloride transfers when bottom loading is not possible or recommended.   3. Splash loading using bungee cords or ropes to secure the product hose to the trailer dome lid is strictly prohibited for any transfers of any liquid products.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Kinder Morgan Materials Services,US,

At approximately 7:30 AM our driver noticed that there was liquid on the ground below his trailer while conducting a Pre Trip inspection on his truck. He discovered that a drum of Sodium Hypochlorite Solution 12.5% on the trailer was leaking upon closer inspection.  The driver observed a small hole in the drum that was responsible for the release.  In the process of the driver removing the drum from the pallet it was on there was a loss of 10 - 20 gallons of Sodium Chlorite inside the trailer.  The Sodium Chlorite inside the trailer and the soil below the trailer was cleaned up using absorbent.  The absorbent and leaking drum were placed into a 95 gallon overpack drum for proper disposal.

The tank car was isolated and the shipper, Domtar Paper Company LLC, was notified via Chemtrec, report #2012-0823-00213. A CSX hazmat manager found vapors releasing from the pressure relief device (PRD) and covered the PRD with plastic bags to prevent release of vapors. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Representative, Barry Zuercher (270) 222-0269 who contracted a mobile repair shop to inspect and repair the PRD.    On August 24, 2012, a CSX hazmat manager returned to the site to inspect the area around the tank car for vapors. There was still a noticeable odor and it appeared that vapors were emanating from the manway. A new nozzle style manway gasket was then placed on the tank car and the odor dissipated.    On August 31, Rescar, a certified mobile repair shop replaced the ""O"" rings in the pressure relief device and placed home shop for repairs stickers on both sides of the tank car. The tank car is currently awaiting an FRA Movement Approval to destination for offloading of the product and then to home shop for re-qualification.    This incident did require a special switching move.    A QA 7.1 Non Conformance Report was completed for this incident.

The tank car was isolated and the shipper, Resolute FP Canada Inc., was notified directly via their emergency contact phone number (807) 475-2400. Hepaco, a CSXT emergency response contractor, responded and found the top operating bottom outlet valve (TOBOV) missing the operating rod. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper representative, Vern Seymour (807) 475-2457. The vapor release was secured by covering the TOBOV assembly with a plastic bag.    On August 27, 2012, a CSXT hazardous material manager installed a wooden cylindrical plug into the void where the TOBOV operating rod was missing and replaced a deteriorated manway gasket. The exterior of the tank car was cleaned using a citrus degreasing agent and water solution to extract any residual material from the tank car.    GATX 45437 will be  transferred into UTLX 67449 and the shipper will request an FRA Movement Approval to home shop the car for repairs.    This incident did require a special move.

The pump was located inside of an old tote modified to function as a containment bin so most of the product was confined to the bin.  Only a few ounces may not have been captured.  The carrier employee cleaned up the material lost due to the failure of the pump fitting.  The consginee was satisfied with the actions taken to clean up the spill.,"We have made all carrier drivers aware of this incident and have requested that they examine their pumps for any signs of cracking or other failure around the fittings.  We have also requested that the drivers and plant employees who perform this task relieve the stress caused by the weight of the heavy-duty hose on the pump outlet and fittings. This can be accomplished by use of bungee cords, an object such as a wood box or other method that will lessen the strain on the pump fitting.

The IBC was not actively leaking but the container emitted an odor and liquid in the form of residue was present on the top of the container from the fusible cap. The IBC was deemed safe to transport and taken back to the carriers facility where the IBC was removed and isolated for inspection at approx. 11:30     An ER team was called at the request of the shipper to investigate the source of the problem and found the fusible cap was loose. The cap was tightened and the IBC was returned to the shipper. The shipper's later investigation revealed the gasket used to seal the fusible cap failed causing the minimal release.     The original delivery trailer the IBC was removed from was inspected and no residue was evident in the trailer and the IBC did not leak in transit back to the carrier's facility. The trailer was placed back in service and the other freight which was not impacted was offered for delivery. The carrier delivered four other shipments and made two pick ups on this trailer.     At 14:00 the carrier received a call from Sonic Electronics 20 minutes after the driver departed to advise they had employees affected by an odor emitting from our trailer and 1 was seen and released at a local hospital then immediately returned to duty. This was on August 8, 2012.      The information gathered by the carrier from the Pleasure Ridge Park Fire Department and Metro Sewer District indicated they found no evidence of a release or hazardous environment upon  arrival and cleared the scene after the carrier had supplied said agencies with the MSDS for the product that was previously contained in the trailer.    None of the other consignees that had contact with the trailer (two before the delivery to Sonic and three after) reported any affects resulting from their contact with the same trailer.

SWRU 102583 was moved and isolated at the facility's containment area awaiting response from the shipper representatives. In the morning of 8/11/2012, the shipper contract responders notified local BNSF personnel that the lading inside SWRU 102583 was smoldering and possibly on fire. Local F.D. agencies were notified and responded. Operations at the BNSF intermodal facility were ceased and all personnel were relocated. The F.D. hazardous material responders reported that the smoke/heat emanating from the intermodal container was created by a chemical reaction from some of the lading within SWRU 102583. After the smoke subsided and air quality returned to normal, the F.D. allowed operations at the intermodal facility to fully resume. Afterwards, the contract responders were able to remove the lading inside SWRU 102583 and initiate the clean-up process. Several pallets of consumer recreational pool care products were charred. These commercial swimming pool products were packaged 4 poly bottles per carton and these cartons were labeled as Oxidizers and some as Corrosives.   The Corrosive material was not declared on the shipping papers received by BNSF or by Swift Transport.  All recovered lading was earmarked for appropriate disposal.

At 12:30 PDT Conestoga-Rovers & Associates (CRA) staff arrived at the scene to assist. SJVR staff had already applied soda ash to the surface to neutralize the acid and washed down the tank car. The vent valve had been tightened and secured and the tank car returned to service. CRA staff assessed the extent of moisture in soil from the acid/rinse water and assisted SJVR staff in mixing in additional soda ash as needed to neutralize any remaining acid. There are no surface or ground water resources at risk at this location. Before leaving the site, CRA staff visually determined that the acid at the surface had been neutralized and that there was no remaining contact risk for pedestrian trespassers. Site actions were complete by 14:15 PDT. CRA personnel contacted Craig Perkins with the Bakersfield Fire Department and Gabe Rubio with the Kern County Environmental Health Department to confirm that the incident had been reported and that no additional filings were necessary.",SJVR continues to inspect all railcars for potential spills/leaks and will continue to do so.

As John proceeded to off load this crate his forks extended though the crate and punctured one of the drums ahead of the crate causing the spill. The spill was contained on dock and the spill was handled in house.","Sat down with Mr. John Sanger (dock man), and discussed the importance of proceeding with caution upon entering trailers with drums. Emphazing the importance of knowing what freight lay ahead of shipments that you are currently off loading, and knowing how far your forks are into the skid that you are presently handling as not to cause damage to shipments in front. All other personel were briefed of this incident as to bring awareness of the dangers of not properly proceeding into skids( being off loaded with a forklift), without being fully aware of what shipments lie ahead. As a general rule, the route driver will inform all dock men of any hazardous material that was picked up on his route during that day as an added precaution to make that dock man aware of the importance of off loading shipments with caution to prevent future recurrence of what happened.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,ABF Freight,US,

SUITE 13,Tampa,FL,33602,Other-Authorized Agent of Carr,"CTMV transporting fuel oil was involved in an accident which resulted in the release of product from impact damage points on the vessel.  The accident location consisted of several sharp curves in rapid session.  The posted speed limit prior to entering the first curve is 55 MPH.  The accident scene consisted of unfinished roadway markings and signage due to the recently performed roadway maintenance activity including resurfacing the roadway itself.    This accident is the result of several factors including time of day (02:20), missing safety warning signage and roadway markings identifying designated lanes.  When our driver entered the curve he was unable to identify critical safety references such as lane designations which would have indicated the severity of the curve.  Driver negotiated two of the three curves and went off the paved surface in the third curve and into the ditch on the side of the roadway.  The vehicle overturned and made impact with a fence.  Driver was injured and vehicle was totaled.","Actions required to prevent accidents such as this one should include both roadway compliance with federal safety markings and signage requirements and increased driver training.  The training will deal with increased dangers associated with later night driving, increased awareness of the importance of road signage and markings along with review of the forces in motion which affect vehicle stability and control resulting from sharp curves and turns involving loaded CTMVs.    It is our position that this accident could have been prevented if the required signage and roadway safety markings were in place.  They have since been installed by the state of Texas. This is an excellent example of the forces in play when cargo tank loads are forced to be redirected before they have had a chance to settle down.  Studies and field tests have shown that two or more curves in close proximity to each other will multiply the forces in motion and decrease stability control of the vehicle.      An additional recommendation was made for this portion of the roadway to have a cautionary 35 MPH speed limit for commercial motor vehicles.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,118000,PO BOX 1440,US,

PTRA notified the shipper, Intercontinental Terminals Company, and M&M Protection to respond to the location to determine the cause and stop the leak. Upon arrival it was discovered that there was a vapor leak between the protective housing and the liquid line valve flange.  ITC attempted to tighten the flange bolts to stop the leak. M&M took gas readings after the initial attempt and did not show any leak present. The following morning, 8/23/12, the car was inspected again and the vapor leak was present in the same location. ITC made another unsuccessful attempt to stop the leak. At that time they sealed the flange bolt area with silicon sealant and the car was set out awaiting an FRA Movment Approval to return the car to ITC for off loading and repairs. The root cause has not been determined. At this time, 9/19/12, we believe it could be a bad gasket or defective housing nozzle.",ITC will conduct a thorough investigation of the car once it is returned to the plant.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1374,PORT TERMINAL RAILROAD ASSOCIATION (INC),US,

There were cars stopped on the roadway waiting for a pilot car. Our Chevrolet truck was pulling a 1000 gallon nurse tank of anhydrous ammonia to a farmers field. The truck was hit broadside on the passenger side by an oncoming construction semi tractor and belly dump rock trailer. The impact knocked the truck off the road and ripped the tongue of the wagon in 2. The wagon stayed on the highway and was impacted by the front corner of the rock trailer in the head of the nurse tank. The impact punctured the tank leaving a 8 inch gash about an inch wide. The nurse tank spun around and tipped over after impact and released most of its contents for about 5 minutes until it froze over. We then picked it up, put it on a flatbed and hauled it to a remote farm field to empty the rest of the contents. That product was contained with water from fire trucks. That product was picked up and land applied. The product released on the roadway immediately following the collision vapored off into the atmosphere, there was no environmental contamination. Our driver was stuck in the cloud of ammonia for a period of time and suffered inhalation exposure. He was stuck in the truck because the seatbelt was so tight around him it was hard to get off.",In this incident the release was a result of a vehicle accident. The semi that hit us was not following the pilot car at the time of the collision.

About 15:00, the driver noticed vaport coming from the rear of the trailer.  The driver immediately exited I-65 South at exit 103.  Vehicle was stopped and off the road as far as possible by 15:13.  Driver opened cabinet at the rear of the trailer and allowed the vapor to dissipate for several minutes before attempting to locate the leak.  As the vapor dissipated, the driver began tightening all valves on the trailer cabinet.  The top fill valve was discovered to have come loose in transport.  Driver tightened the top fill valve and the leak immediately stopped.  By 15:30, the leak was secured and local police arrived at the scene.

The package was delivered by UPS along with several other packages on 8/21/12 at 10:45.  Warehouse personnel did a quick inspection and placed the package in the EnRad radioactive material storage area.    Upon inspection by EnRad Radiation Protection personnel, it was discovered that the package had been breached in 2 locations (see attached photographs). The breach consisted of a slit approximately 2 inches in length in the upper section of the drum and a smaller puncture in the lower section of the drum.  The breaches were caused by the equipment inside the drum puncturing the wall of the drum. Additionally, it was noted that the package has significant damage overall.    Radiation and contamination surveys were immediately conducted on the external surfaces of the package. No external package removable contamination was detected.  The package was opened and additional contamination surveys were conducted inside the package. No removable contamination was detected on the inside of the drum or on the equipment inside the package.    BNP Management, EnRad Management, and Duke Energy Fleet Services Management were notified of the incident.  It was determined that the event was a DOT Hazardous Material incident requiring notification of the DOT. Duke Energy EnRad Laboratories accepted the responsibility for reporting the incident, even though the breach occurred during transport, since they had received the package. The DOT National Response Center was notified of the incident on 8/21/12 at 19:30. Additionally, EnRad made courtesy calls to the NC State Radioactive Materials Branch after hour number and to Mecklenburg County Emergency Management.  BNP notified their resident NRC inspector and American Nuclear Insurance of the event.  Description of Package:  The packaging was a certified DOT Type A Package (UN/1A/X/201S/04) certified for 2651bs of material. The drum lid was torque as required.  The torque wrench bench was made of steel and had rounded corners but the edges were relatively sharp metal.  It weighed approximately 95 pounds.  The torque wrench bench was placed in the drum at an angle with a sharp edge resting on the floor and the sharp edges of the top of the bench leaning on the upper walls of the drum.  The bottom edge of the bench on the floor of the drum was padded with layers of cloth. The upper section of the bench was wrapped in bubble wrap.  Condition of Package at Destination (see attached photographs):  The bottom rim of the drum was crumpled from the outside in a manner that indicated that the drum had a significant impact when the drum was at an angle (e.g.; potentially dropped on bottom rim when drum was at an angle).  The floor of the drum was di","1.   The shipper (BNP) has ceased all shipments of radioactive materials via common carrier and will utilize the services of a contracted courier service to transport excepted packages of radioactive material and equipment this will provide more accountability and oversight for the quality of routine hazardous materials transportation.  2.   Reviewed the event and provided additional training and guidance with BNP receiving warehouse facility personnel on the need to do a detailed inspection of packages (both radioactive and non-radioactive) prior to releasing the driver of the carrier delivering the packages. Early identification of damaged packages will help in the investigation and the accountability for the damage.  3.   Reviewed the event and provided additional training and guidance with BNP Radwaste Shipping group personnel on the need to consider unexpected transport conditions when shoring and packaging items that may encounter conditions outside of the expected conditions of transport, i.e. normal jostling, bumps and moving container from one truck to another during the contracted transport period (normal conditions of transport).  4.

This transfer of ethanol from railcar to truck is conducted with a electric mobile pump. On the mobile pump there is a filter that must be inspected before the pump is used. As part of his pre-inspection checklist, the employee opened the filter housing to visually inspect the filter but did not tighten the locking bolt on the filter housing after inspection. He continued the setup of the transfer by connecting the grounding cables, vapor recovery lines, product hose to the railcar, and plugging up the electric pump. From underneath the railcar he then opened up the product valve allowing ethanol to flow to the pump. After coming out from under the car he noticed ethanol oozing out from the partially cracked open filter lid on the pump. He moved in the closer to inspect the oozing product and when he touched the filter lid, it popped off from the pressure that had built up in the filter and ethanol began to flow from the pump filter. It took approximately 7 seconds for the employee to get back to the railcar to shut off the product valve and stop the flow of ethanol. He radioed for a spill response and several employees came to assist with applying oil absorbents and sand on the impacted area. Approximately 20 gallons of denatured ethanol was released onto the asphalt surface. No drains, soil, or water were impacted from the release. The contaminated oil dry and sand was swept up and placed into appropriate containers for scheduled pick up and appropriate removal. At 06:14 the Terminal Manager called the Area Ops Director and he in turn contacted KMMS EHS and all other appropriate parties (TRANSFLO). The NRC was contacted at 7:05 to report the release since the Reportable Quantity was exceeded.",Direct/Intermediate Causes  Failure to follow procedure/Policy/Practice  •Employee failed to fully complete the inspection of his equipment utilizing the daily equipment checklist  •Employee failed to follow pre-transfer procedures in Procedure # 3025- Transferring Ethanol Via Metered Pump   •Employee failed to refer to form 1642 B indicating that the equipment inspection is completed  •Employee failed to recognize the risk in not completing one task before moving to the next  •Before opening the railcar the employee failed to stop and make a mental note that all connections were in tack     Basic / Root Causes:   •Extreme judgment / decision demands - Employee was focused on setting up the railcars for the day   •Lack of situational awareness- Although the employee did not feel the need to stop he failed to recognize that before he opened the railcar there is a need to retrace his steps to ensure that all openings are secure.  •Improper attempt to save time or effort - Thinking that he would save some time he stopped the task of inspecting the filter and moved directly to hooking up the railcar fittings    Corrective Actions Taken:  •Review transloading procedure # 3025 (Transferring Ethanol Via Metered Pump) to ensure that controls that are incorporated into policies and procedures are utilized.     •Retrain all employees on transload procedure # 3025 and use form 1642B to ensure that critical tasks are performed.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Kinder Morgan Terminals,US,

The shipment in question that offered for transportation by Phillips Lumileds Lighting Company located in San Jose, CA.  Upon arrival samples of the waste material were taken and tested in compliance with the facility’s waste analysis plan.  All waste verification test results met the waste acceptance parameters and was approved for unloading at the appropriate unloading bay.   Upon arrival at the off-loading bay, the vehicle operator opened the container and proceeded to unload the roll-off container.  Approximately 5 – 10 percent of the material was off-loaded when a small fire was observed on the outside of one of the boxes that had been unloaded and it involved an area approximately 10 inches by 10 inches.  Facility personnel immediately extinguished the fire with a hand held extinguisher.  Immediately after extinguishing the fire, facility personnel contacted the onsite emergency coordinator who shut down operations in this one specific bay in order to investigate the incident.  In addition, the roll-off container was moved to a secure location to safeguard personnel and property should another fire breakout.    An investigation was initiated that included member of Clean Harbors and Phillips Illumined Lighting.  Upon consultation with the offeror, it is was determined that a either a small portion of the debris may have inadvertently come into contact with white phosphorous or a small amount of white phosphorous may have been shipped in the roll-off.    It was then decided to sort the remaining material and identify any additional materials that may have been contaminated with this material.  During the sorting process, Clean Harbor’s personnel removed and containerized 1 30 gallon container of debris that was suspected to contain a small percentage of white phosphorous.  This material was rejected back to the offeror for proper disposal.  The remaining load was received and processed at the facility without incident.","At the time the material was offered for transportation, the driver inspected the shipment and there were no indications that a problem existed.  In order to prevent a recurrence, Clean Harbors suspended the acceptance of this waste stream until the offeror confirmed that they took all appropriate steps to insure cross contamination of waste streams did not occur that could result in a repeat occurrence.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1262000,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

The agent proceeded to ask the passenger for paperwork for his personal oxygen concentrator (POC), as well as verifying his machine. It was then that the agent realized it was not a POC but a small tank of oxygen. The agent called for assistance from a supervisor. Supervisor Giavanni Carballo spoke with the passenger about the oxygen bottles. The passenger was elderly and stated that he was unaware of Frontier's policies concerning POCs or oxygen bottles, which was why he did not declare them. He stated that he had brought the bottles from LAX (Flight 404, Aircraft N905FR, LAX-DEN) but had not used them in flight. He stated that they were for backup and used only on an as-needed basis. After explaining Frontier policy with an emphasis on safety, Mr. Carballo gave a copy of Frontier's oxygen policy to the passenger, along with a blank copy of our POC doctor authorization form for future reference. He then voluntarily give up the bottle of oxygen he had out, stating he would be fine in the air without it. He did, however, attempt to hide a second bottle which he did not bother to mention. He insisted that the second bottle was empty, but subsequent inspection found that it was not. He then surrendered the second bottle after being told he could not board the aircraft with the oxygen bottle.",NO COMMENTS GIVEN,No,CYLINDER,"Cylinder, a pressure vessel for compressed gases",CYL,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"FRANTIER AIRLINES, INC.",US,

The driver was driving east on HWY (RT.) 66 and was attempting to make a left turn at the intersection of HWY (RT.) 66. While making the turn the left side of the trailer came off the ground, ultimately tipping the truck and trailer onto their right side.  Assessment of Root Cause: The driver needed to make a wider than normal turn due to a vehicle that was ""nosed out"" into the intersection.  This wide turn put the driver and transport onto a pitched section of the road surface.  While the drivers speed would not have been excessive for a ""normal"" turn, the combination of the wide turn, sloped (pitched) road and speed caused the liquid load to shift and put the whole transport unit off balance.  Assessment of Contributing Cause(s): Because of the wider than normal turn, the left side of the trailer raised the fenders and the hydraulic lines of the trailer caught on the frame rails of the truck, preventing the two from pivoting.  The weight of the trailer then pushed the truck over to the road curb where it was ""tripped"" and went over onto its right side.  Mitigating Circumstances: The rigid construction of the tank trailer allowed it to withstand the impact without rupturing or leaking. (NO Release)",1) Investigate if distance between trailer and hitch point can be extended to allow pivoting when making wider turns.                                                                   2) Assign driver refresher training to transport driver involved in incident.           3) Investigate the need to change travel times for transport trucks to daylight hours to avoid the hazards that come with nighttime driving and to increase sight conditions.  4) Discuss this incident and findings with all Elkhorn transport drivers.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,115497,ELKHORN GAS PROCESSING,US,

The unit were Northbound on 15,north of Seattle,WA  • Mr Carter advised that a pop up valve or cap had come off the trailer, and a release of the product, which was Boral, landed on his service truck. Mr Carter was also concerned for his own well being, but  was unsure if any of the product had come in the open window of his truck, and was on his person. Mr Carter wanted to know what he should expect if he did come into contact with the product, and what he should do. I asked Mr Carter if he felt a burning sensation, or had any skin irritations,and he advised that he did not, but did say that he felt a tingling sensation in his arms and legs, that he believed may have been nerves due to the incident. I advised Mr Carter that if he was at all concerned with his well being, that he should seek immediate medical attention.  • After talking to Mr Carter, I asked Frank Scanlan, Operations Supervisor for NWTl, if he was aware of the incident. Frank told me that he was, and that he received a call from Mr Carter moments before I did, advising that something had blown off the trailer, causing a release of product. Mr Carter did not say anything to Frank about a possible Injury,so due to the fact the cell reception was poor, Frank's main  concern  was to get off the phone with Mr Carter,and contact the driver,In order tostop the truck, and have the driver inspect the unit for any leaks.  • Contacted Daniel Martin to try and get more information as to what happened, and develop an action plan. Daniel told me that he was pulled over to the side of the road, at exit 164A, northbound on 15. Shortly after he had pulled over,a DOT Inspector had pulled In behind him and we assume had called the Fire Department. The Fire Department was on scene and had closed down the highway pending their investigation as to what was in the trailer. Daniel advised that he would need a new wash out cap before he was able to go anywhere, and Frank Scanlan began calling various companies to try to obtain one. Daniel also advised that residue of the product had spilled down from the side of the trailer and that there was a wet spot under the trailer, but no puddles were apparent at that time. Daniel was unsure as to what the Fire Department was going to do,so I asked him to talk to them and call me back once a decision was made.  • Contacted Linda Waltonberg at Rohm and Haas in Elma,Washington. This was the company from which we picked up the product. Advised Linda of the release of product,the possible injury to a motorist, and that Emergency personnel were on scene. Linda appeared content that we were handling the situation and that was the end of the call.  • At 2:30 PM,Frank Scanlan received a call from Daniel Martin, advising that the Fire Department still had the highway closed, and were going to put sand on the affected area u","1.

August 13, 2012 approximately at 9 am Monday morning, Aloha Petroleum truck #19215 operated by Paul Bega was filling the Honolulu Disposal above-ground storage  tank with diesel. During the delivery the driver reported a spill to Aloha's dispatch office. The driver stated the hose cam-locks at the connection point on the truck disconnected. The driver shut the pump off but not before 93 gallons of diesel spilled. Coastal Industrial Services was notified by Aloha's dispatch and they responded to the spill. 93 gallons of diesel spilled was cleaned up using oil absorbent material, the waste was placed in 55-gallon drums and will be properly disposed of. Aloha notified the National Response Center, Hawaii HEER Office and the Local Emergency Planning Committee. Honolulu Disposal EPA ID# HIP 000 141 291 is located at 1169 Mikole Street, Honolulu, Hawaii 96819.  August 17, 2012 approximately at 6 am Friday morning, Aloha Petroleum truck #19215 operated by Art Rabago was filling the same diesel tank at Honolulu Disposal. The driver reported a spill had occurred to Aloha's dispatch office. The driver stated the hose cam-locks at the connection point on the truck disconnected. Dispatch called Aloha's clean up contractor Coastal Industrial Services. Coastal responded and cleaned up the 34 gallons of diesel. Aloha Petroleum notified the National Response Center and was assigned incident number 1021351. Hawaii HEER Office and the Local Emergency Planning Committee were also notified.  When truck 19215 returned to the terminal, Aloha had the mechanic check the vehicle's pumping system. Truck 19215 is equipped with a boost system that increases the pumping rate from 85 GPM to 110 GPM. The mechanic stated the boost system is operating normally and the hose cam-locks were only slightly worn. Aloha sent the mechanic to Honolulu Disposal to inspect the above-ground storage tank.  The mechanic inspected the tank and tested the tanks delivery system. He found the diesel tank venting system was blocked.","The root cause of both spills is a combination of a blocked vent and a booster pump that created excessive back pressure on the hose and caused the cam-locks to disconnect. To correct the problem and prevent future occurrences, Aloha replaced the cam-locks on the hose and disconnected the booster pump on the truck. Aloha cleared the blocked vent on the Honolulu Disposal diesel tank.

One of the drums was punctured by the forklift blade causing 2.5 gallons to leak out in the rear of the trailer.    The release was roughly 1 minute as the liquid slowly leaked out of the 5 gallon drum.  Employee immediately notified supervisor and he used quick-dri to contain the spilled liquid from leaking out of the back of the trailer onto the ground.

I loaded the product and arrived on-scene at approximately 0905 hrs. Upon entering the properly, I proceeded to the superintendants office and took an electronic tank level reading from the veeder root system there. After, I continued on around the yard and set up my truck and trailer to the south of the on-site tanks for off loading. I sat in my truck and studied the tank readings along with the order amounts I was given. I knew that I had wanted to offload the 2800 gallon compartment of gasoline (E-87) on my truck first into tank three on site. I exited my truck and connected all fittings and hoses and began my off load. I checked to see that everything was operating properly and entered my truck to do the paperwork for the delivery.    When the compartment emptied, I exited my truck and walked around the truck to find a Mentor city employee coming my way shouting that the product had begun to come out of the top of the tank and was spilling upon the ground on the opposite side of where I was offloading. I apparently had hooked to the wrong tank and assumed reading left to right that tank three was to the right of them. I immediately shut off the compartment and ran around to the cab of the truck to shut down the pump system. I then ran around the tanks and we began opening spill kits to try and block the fuel from entering the storm drain located on the backside of the tanks. I ran to my truck and grabbed as many absorbent pads as I could and ran back. Numerous employees then began running up with a pig pads (absorbent pads) and sand bags and eventually other employees came over with a tow motor containing numerous bags of oil dry and they were spread thoughout the area. The fire department and Mike Grummitt were notified immediately. It was determined that roughly 200 gallons of product had been lost.    The fire department arrived on scene and traced the storm drain on the property to a retention basin located at the northeast corner of the property and check for contamination in the pond. There was very little and to be precautionary, they put up an absorbent barrier around the outlet. The EPA was notified along with inland Waters for cleanup. Members from the Lubrizol fire department showed up around 1040 and it was determined for best interest to insert and inflatable plug into the drainage line to deter and possible contamination to which they did.    EPA officials arrived on the scene to evaluate the situation and it was determined that the situation had been handled quite well and no product had made its way off of the premises. Safety Officer Ray Lipa from Great lakes Petroleum showed up to evaluate and document the situation. Just after 1200 hrs, members of inland waters arrived on site and began cleanup. A vac truck was used to skim the product off of the top of the standing water in the s","For all intensive purposes, this was an accident. There was no malice or dereliction of duty involved. It was simple mistake of blind fill tanks that have neither outside way of reading them nor a way of sticking them for volume. They neither have catch areas for spills nor alarms to notify that the tank was being overfilled.    Operator instructed per his training to always stick the tanks before offloading and to never as per his training to always remain at point of fill until complete. We are currently reviewing all training associated with this incident/action to see what additional training can be done to prevent future incidents.",Yes,,Cargo tanks,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,9099,GREAT LAKES PETROLEUM,US,

MAIN ST,MINOT,ND,58701,Carrier,"AT ABOUT 22:45 ON 8/23/12 I WAS HOME WHEN I GOT A CALL FROM FRANKLIN BLOUNT THAT ADAM HAD JUST HAD A MAJOR SPILL AT EMSERCO TRENTON FACILITY. I ASKED HIM TO RUN OVER THERE AS HE WAS MUCH CLOSER THAN GREGG THE NIGHT SHIFT LEAD DRIVER. FRANKLIN THEN CALLED ME BACK ABOUT 1/2 HOUR LATER AND CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS INDEED A VERY LARGE SPILL (APPROX 10 BBLS). I DIRECTED FRANKLIN AND ADAM TO SECURE THE AREA AND HELP DIRECT THE TRUCK TRAFFIC AROUND THE AREA UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO GET ON SCENE. AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO STANDING OIL ON THE GROUND THAT COULD BE EITHER SUCKED UP OR SOAKED UP AS IT HAD ALL ABSORBED INTO THE GROUND. I THEN CALLED ROB ELMORE OF FALCO THAT OPERATES THE FACILITY AND INFORMED HIM OF THE SPILL AND PROCEEDED TO THE LOCATION. UPON ARRIVING AND INSPECTING THE SPILL (ABOUT 2:00 AM ON 8/24) THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD DO UNTIL DAYLIGHT SO WE WAITED UNTIL ROB ARRIVED ON LOCATION ABOUT 7:00 AM. I DID TALK WITH ADAM AT THAT POINT TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. HE INFORMED THAT HE HAD CHECKED THE TANK LEVELS, HOOKED UP HIS HOSE AND BEGAN UNLOADING, SIGNED INTO THE LOG IN THE SHACK AND THEN WENT TO THE CAB OF HIS TRUCK TO ATTEND TO SOME PAPERWORK. THIS IS AGAINST OUR COMPANY POLICY. THE DRIVERS SHOULD ALWAYS ATTEND TO THEIR VALVES WHILE LOADING AND UNLOADING. ADAM ADMITTED TO NOT FOLLOWING PROCEDURE AT THAT TIME.    WHEN ROB ARRIVED WE DISCUSSED THE OPTIONS FOR CLEANUP AND CONTACTED JMAC AND BEGAN THE PAPERWORK PROCESS SO THAT THEY COULD EXCAVATE AND PROPERLY DISPOSE OF THE CONTAMINATED DIRT. WE ALSO HAD ADAM DRUG TESTED AT THAT TIME AS IS COMPANY POLICY.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,Yes,,Cargo tanks,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,29232,GOLDSPUR,US,
