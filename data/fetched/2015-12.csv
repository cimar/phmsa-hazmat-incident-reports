When I investigated, I had found that the liquid valve on the B end was leaking.  The plug in the leaking valve along with the other two plugs in the other valves were less than hand tight.  I tried to tighten the valve handle on the leaking valve but when I did, the valve would turn on its own after a few seconds and reopen.  I tried this several times and got the same result.  I could not get the valve handle to stay closed.  I then tightened the plug in the leaking valve, and the leak stopped.  I also tightened the plugs in the other two valves.

The car was isolated and employees were removed from the area.  BNSF Hazmat responders inspected the car and found that the liquid and vapor line plugs were both less than hand tight on the fittings.  Both valves were closed but vapor was seeping past the closed liquid line valve creating the odor.  The plugs were secured and tool tightened which stopped the release.  The car was isolated and shipper notified to work with the FRA to obtain an OTMA for further movement to offload and to shop for repair and inspection.

Henrietta Road, Avon NY.  During the normal course of business, materials are brought to this location where they are temporarily stored pending continued transportation.  At approximately 3:00 AM on December 16, 2015 the facility’s fire alarm activated which was responded to by the Avon NY Fire Department.  Upon arrival, Fire Department Personnel gained access to the facility, identified three non-bulk polyethylene containers stored on a wooden pallet were smoldering/on fire and proceeded to extinguish the fire using both water and foam. Once the scene was under control, an emergency response crew  comprised of employees from both Safety-Kleen Systems and Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc initiated response activities which included the re-containerization of nearby containers impacted by water and firefighting foam, containerization of all clean-up debris including all firefighting water that was collected in a fully contained secondary confinement unit and decontamination/cleaning of all impacted surfaces. All materials generated as a result of the response activities were disposed of at a fully licensed waste management facility. It is important to note that the storage location where the incident occurred was designed for the storage of hazardous material/hazardous waste and is within a sealed secondary containment unit. There were no waterways impacted as a result of the initial fire or firefighting activities.","At the conclusion of the response activities, an internal investigation was initiated to determine the materials involved and the suspected cause of the incident. The investigation revealed that a field crew had packaged multiple 1-gallon containers of unused, unopened and outdated Organic Peroxide Type D liquids into polyethylene non-bulk packages for the purpose of transportation and disposal using vermiculite to for cushioning. At the time the material was prepared for transportation the individual containers were inspected and found to be in shippable condition. During the course of transportation, the containers were off-loaded into a warehouse pending continued transportation. Prior to the incident, a routine facility inspection was conducted and the containers appeared normal. The shipper of the material was contacted and we confirmed that the material offered for transportation and disposal was outdated material that had never been opened. The Safety Data Sheet was reviewed and the material was not exposed to any listed incompatible materials or had been subjected to temperatures in excess of the documented self-accelerating decomposition temperatures of 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit).    Our investigation was not able to identify the cause of the incident but will continue to insure that all material prepared for transportation are done so in full compliance with all applicable rules and regulations. In addition, deviations from our established protocols if identified will be investigated and appropriate corrective actions taken to ensure compliance going forward.

It was left open from when the wash facility cleaned it.  About 2 gallons leaked out on to the ground before he noticed it and closed the valve.  He didn't notice it at first with the angle his truck was parked at.  He and the customer handled the cleanup.,This valve was not one the drivers normally use and was out of immediate visibility.  That said the driver came in to go through what we refer to as Performance Enhancement Training to ensure he understands the expectations on his regarding pre-trip & pre-unload procedures.  I will add that we had an additional 2 other non-hazardous spills recently from the same valve so we have now sent out a fleet message to create awareness on the topic.

SPSI's investigation revealed the top mounted exterior pressure relief device was secured via a 4 bolt flange - this flange was welded to the top of the car in an apparent historical retrofit. The welded connection between the riser and the tank was cracked, resulting in the release of material during transportation. Due to recent rain event, the moisture on the top of the car adjacent to the pressure relief device was inspected with colometric pH paper, and confirmed the presence of an alkaline material consistent with the registered material being transported in the tank car. The tank car was wiped free from moisture / product, and testing was performed on standing water adjacent to the car on the tracks - confirming no release to the ground. A temporary patch using a commercial plugging compound was used to prevent any further release.    On 14 December 2015 Joseph Taylor, Manager Hazardous Materials CSX Transportation contacted Kevin Blackwell, FRA Hazardous Materials Washington, DC and was given permission to have the car moved from its standing position in the yard, to the adjacent facility - consignee. This move was conducted on 15 December 2015 without further release and the car is to be offloaded, cleaned + purged, and necessary repairs made.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CSX Transportation,US,

The ash was being dredged from a pond on property site and transported with dump trucks approximately 4.3 miles to the on site ash landfill for final disposal. Approximately 1.25 miles of this route was along Utah State Road 31. The spill started on a gravel road and extended onto approximately 100 yards of the asphalt surface of Utah SR 31. As soon as the driver noticed the failed tailgate, he pulled to the side of the road effectively mitigating any more spillage. The spill was reported to the on-shift supervisor at 16:30 and then to the PacifiCorp internal spill hotline @ 16:47. At 17:05, the spill was reported to the State of Utah Division Environmental Response and Remediation. Clean-up activities included scooping up the ash on the road with a front end loader and cleaning the highway with a street sweeper. The Utah Highway Patrol assisted with the after-hours clean-up by providing with traffic control. The road remained open during the entire clean-up procedure. Final clean-up took place during the morning hours of 12/10/2015.","The contractor that was hired to provide the dredging and ash removal services took the faulty dump truck off site for repair.

After connecting the loading hose, the driver failed to close the valve. Once loading began, the catch basin filled with product and began overflowing onto the ground. The driver had stepped away from the connection point unaware of the situation. Upon returning to the connection point a few minutes later and realizing the situation, the driver shut down all loading processes. The driver then closed the valve inside the catch basin, built dams to secure the spilled product, contacted management, and began cleaning up the spilled product using items from the spill kit located on his equipment. The product was absorbed by utilizing medium density absorption pads. Afterwards, Oil gator micro bug was applied to and rake into the soil surface to help assist the remediation process and further absorption of product. The affected area was located on the clay, gravel soil surface immediately surrounding the catch basin at the loading head and a small portion of the loading area. It continued along the ground down into two clay soil bottomed vehicle track furrows that led to the loading point. The product lightly covered the surface in an area approximately ten feet wide by ten feet long up to the furrows. It then split lightly filling the furrows, which were approximately fourteen to eighteen inches wide, for approximate fifty feet. The product was maintained inside the furrows until removed. The area will continue to be monitored for a period long enough to comfortably feel all product has sufficiently been absorbed. This will include any periods of precipitation. The affected soil will the ben removed and replaced.

The crew member at once notified the train dispatcher and the car was isolated until the railroads environmental response arrived (the shipper and customer were also notified). Upon arrival, the railroads contracted response (Moran environmental recovery) assessed the car (including fittings and securements) there was no obvious location where the product had likely escaped. Further testing included moving the car with a locomotive in order to determine a leak point. This also resulted with no leak observed, however there was a very noticeable smell of ethanol and to repair the problem. On 12/23 a rescue crew arrived to affect repairs and release the car for normal service. The rescue crew replaced (with new seals) the manway and multi-housing gaskets. They stated that the car also looked to be ""very full"" with only about eight to ten inches of air space above the product. Once the repairs were completed, the care was moved to the worcester scale track and weighed, the car was again inspected and then released for normal service.",It appears that the manway gaskets had become brittle breaking apart are the repairs crew removed it; this appears to have allowed a small amount product seepage and vapors to escape.

The driver dropped the hose and rinsed off at the safety shower. The hazardous material in the hose drained to the consignee's containment area before the driver returned from the safety shower. The consignee handled remediation of spilled product to their containment area in-house. Carrier's liquid transfer hose seemed to have had built up pressure because of an ambient temperature change. Thehose had been closed with its blank flanges after the prior delivery and an increase in temperature since then caused a corresponding increase in pressure inside the hose, thus allowing product to spray out when the driver released the flange.

UNIT WAS NOT DUE FOR ANNUAL MAINTENANCE. THE SLOSHING OF THE LIQUID CAUSED A SMALL AMOUNT TO SEEP OUT IN TO THE MANWAY AND FALL TO THE GROUND VIA THE DRAIN AS THE DRIVER WAITED ON W BRADLEY TO ENTER THE FACILITY. AFTER THE TRUCK ENTERED THE CUSTOMER SITE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT IT HAD BEGUN TO LEAK. THE CUSTOMER HAD THE DRIPS ON SITE CLEANED UP BY THEIR PERSONNEL AND DISPATCHED THE LOCAL FIRE DEPT TO DEAL WITH THE SMALL SPILL ON BRADLEY. THE SMALL SPILL WAS NEUTRALIZED AND CLEANED UP BY THE HAZARDOUS INCIDENT RESPONSE TEAM (HLRT) OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. OUR CONTACT WAS BRAD LONG. THEY INVESTIGATED HIS LAST TWO LAYOVER LOCATIONS AND FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SPILL. INSPECTION OF THE TRAILER REVEALED THE SOURCE OF ISSUE VISUALLY. THE TRAILER WAS EMPTIED USING A PUMP TO ENSURE NEGATIVE PRESSURE AT THE CONNECTION AND MATERIAL WAS OFFLOADED IN CUSTOMER TANK. THE FLANGE WAS TIGHTENED ON SIGHT AND ALL MATERIAL WAS NEUTRALIZED AND TRAILER RINSED PRIOR TO RETURN TRIP TO SHERWOOD, OREGON. THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS DUE THE FAILURE OF THE WELL-PIPE SEAL. WHILE ON SITE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ALL TO THE BOLTS TO THIS FLANGE WERE INSUFFICIENTLY TORQUED. TIGHTENING THEM ONSITE WAS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER RELEASE. UPON IT'S RETURN, THE TRAILER WELL-PIPE CONNECTION WAS DISASSEMBLED AND DECONNED ALONG WITH THE BARREL OF THE TRAILER SO THAT IT COULD BE SERVICED. THERE WERE NO NOTABLE ISSUES WITH ANY OF THE SEALS BUT AS NOTED BY CASCADE AND POLAR SERVICE CENTER IN PORTLAND, OR, ALL OF THE BOLTS TO THE OTHER BOLTED FLANGES WERE LOOSE, SOME OF THEM TAKING TWO FULL TURNS TO SUFFICIENTLY TIGHTEN. SINCE THE TRAILER WAS PURCHASED AND PUT INTO SERVICE ONLY 8 MONTHS PRIOR THEN IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE EITHER A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, MAINTENANCE DEFECT OF BOTH.",FIXED FLANGE CONNECTIONS ARE NOW ON A PERIODIC MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE.

A MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT FAILURE IN THE UPPER MANIFOLD OF THE AIR DIAPHRAGM PUMP OCCURRED WHILE BLOWING THE LINE CLEAR AND HE WAS EXPOSED TO A MOMENTARY RELEASE OF 93% SULFURIC ACID MIST. ACCORDING THE CUSTOMER, THE DRIVER WAS WEARING ALL OF HIS PPE, INCLUDING FACE SHIELD AND GOGGLES, AND WENT IMMEDIATELY INTO THE EWSS. EMT AND FIRE WERE CALLED AND HE REMAINED IN THE EWSS UNTIL THEY ARRIVED ON-SITE. HE HAS BEEN TAKEN VIA AMBULANCE TO HARBOR GENERAL IN CARSON, CA. NATE WAS BURNED AROUND HIS RIGHT EYE TOWARDS THE TEMPLE, HIS NECK AND A PORTION OF HIS RIGHT UPPER TORSO. HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRANSFERRED TO THE BURN UNIT AND HAS SINCE BEEN RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL. THE INITIAL VIEWING OF THE SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE SHOWS THE DRIVER STANDING BY THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE PUMP BOX AND THEN CROUCHING BY THE BOX AND REACHING INTO IT. THE VIDEO THEN SHOWS A MOMENTARY PRESSURE RELEASE OF ACID MIST ORIGINATING FROM THE, BOX: THE DRIVER THEN PROCEEDS AROUND THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE, REMOVING A HARD HAT AND GLOVES AS HE RUNS TO THE SAFETY SHOWER LOCATED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TRUCK, APPROXIMATELY 6 SECONDS ELAPSE BETWEEN THE EXPOSURE AND THE SHOWER ACTIVATION. BASED ON THE VIDEO EVIDENCE, THE DRIVER SPENT AT LEAST 13 MINUTES UNDER THE SAFETY SHOWER. THE CUSTOMER REPORTS HE STAYED IN THE SHOWER UNTIL THE PARAMEDICS ARRIVED BUT THIS IS NOT SEEN ON THE FOOTAGE. PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE SCENE SHOW A MECHANICAL FAILURE OF THE PASSENGER SIDE 90 DEGREE END ON THE UPPER MANIFOLD OF THE ARO PUMP. THIS MECHANICAL FAILURE APPEARS TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE ACID VAPOR BLAST THAT HIT THE DRIVER.

PVS Minibulk Driver was in the process of making a delivery to Carson Cogeneration in Carson California when he was exposed to 66 degree Sulfuric while completing the delivery. A mechanical equipment failure in the upper manifold of the air diaphragm pump occurred while blowing the line clear and he was exposed to a momentary release of 93% sulfuric acid mist.     According the customer, the driver was wearing all of his PPE, including face shield and goggles, and went immediately into the EWSS. EMT and Fire were called and he remained in the EWSS until they arrived on-site. He has been taken via ambulance to Harbor General in Carson, CA. Nate was burned around his right eye towards the temple, his neck and a portion of his right upper torso. He was subsequently transferred to the burn unit and has since been released from the hospital.     The initial viewing of the security camera footage shows the driver standing by the passenger side of the pump box and then crouching by the box and reaching into it. The video then shows a momentary pressure release of acid mist originating from the box. The","A.

THIS PRACTICE HAS BEEN FORBIDDEN EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT AND COMMUNICATED TO ALL DRIVERS.   THE PUMP MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION ARE UNDER REVIEW TO DETERMINE IF A MORE SUITABLE DESIGN OR MATERIAL WOULD REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF REPEAT OCCURRENCE.

EQUIPMENT. WHILE GOING DOWN A DECLINE WITH A CURVE TO THE LEFT (PICTURE1) THE VEHICLES RIGHT FRONT TIRE LEFT THE PAVEMENT. THE MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAD RECENTLY ADDED SOME AGGREGATE TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE CURVE IN AN ATTEMPT TO ALLEVIATE A SHARP ""BREAK"" FROM THE PAVEMENT TO THE DITCH. THIS MATERIAL WAS NOT COMPACTED. THE TRANSITION AREA AND DITCH WERE VERY SOFT AS A RESULT OF RECENT RECORD SETTING RAINS. BECAUSE OF THE STEEP ANGEL AND SOFTNESS OF THE DITCH, THE DRIVER HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO ATTEMPT TO REGAIN THE PAVEMENT. IN DOING SO, THE VEHICLE REGAINED THE ROADWAY AT AN ACUTE ANGLE, CAUSING THE DRIVER TO LOSE CONTROL. THE VEHICLE THEN OVERTURNED ON ITS RIGHT SIDE, SLIDING ACROSS THE ROAD AND ENTERING THE OPPOSITE DITCH REAR END FIRST. THE VEHICLE CAME TO REST AS SHOWN IN PICTURE 2.   THE DRIVER EXITED THE VEHICLE AND CALLED PETERSON OIL COS. OFFICE. OFFICE PERSONNEL CALLED 911 WITH A DESCRIPTION AND APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE ACCIDENT. AFTER CALLING 911, OFFICE PERSONNEL THEN CALLED PETERSON OIL CO MANAGEMENT. PETERSON OIL CO MANAGEMENT AND SULLIVAN FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON THE SCENE NEAR THE SAME TIME. AS THE VEHICLE WAS LEAKING LPG VAPORS, IT WAS DECIDED TO BLOCK THE ROADWAY AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE ACCIDENT. THE DRIVER WAS TAKEN BY PRIVATE VEHICLE TO MISSOURI BAPTIST HOSPITAL TO BE EXAMINED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. HE FOUND TO HAVE SUFFERED NO INJURIES.   IT WAS DETERMINED THAT WHEN THE VEHICLE SLID BACKWARDS INTO THE DITCH A 3/4 INCH PIPE NIPPLE CONNECTING THE EXCESS FLOW VALVE (THREADED INTO THE TANK) AND THE 3/4 INCH HAND WHEEL GLOBE VALVE HAD BEEN BENT AND CRACKED. SEE PICTURE 3. THE EXCESS FLOW VALVE, A REGO A32726 RATED AT 20 GPM LPG/ 10 GPM NH3 INITIALLY DID NOT CLOSE, ALLOWING LIQUID AND VAPOR LPG TO LEAK FROM THE TANK.    AFTER LEAKING FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 HOURS THE EXCESS FLOW VALVE SHUT STOPPING THE LEAK. IT IS UNKNOWN EXACTLY WHY THE EXCESS FLOW VALVE FAILED TO INITIALLY CLOSE OR WHY IT CLOSED LATER. IT IS THEORIZED THAT CRACK IN THE PIPING NIPPLE DID NOT INITIALLY ALLOW SUFFICIENT ESCAPING LPG LIQUID PHASE FLOW TO CLOSE THE EXCESS FLOW VALVE. AS THE LIQUID LPG LEVEL IN THE TANK DECREASED MORE VAPOR PHASE LPG WAS RELEASED. EVENTUALLY THE VAPOR PHASE FLOW EXCEEDED THE FLOW RATE OF THE EXCESS FLOW VALVE AND IT SHUT. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN TOWED TO PETERSON OIL CO'S PLANT. AT PETERSON OIL'S PLANT, THE REMAINING LPG WAS PUMPED FROM THE TANK.   NO MITIGATION WAS REQUIRED AS THE LPG VAPORIZED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DAMAGES. SEE ATTACHED REPORT FROM THE SULLIVAN FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT.    PHOTO ATTACHED","IT APPEARS, TO THE BEST OF PETERSON OIL CO KNOWLEDGE, THAT NO ACTIONS ARE NECESSARY CONCERNING THE EQUIPMENT FACING TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. A WRECK, CAUSING DAMAGE TO AN EXCESS FLOW VALVE, CONTRIBUTED TO THE LEAK OF LPG FROM PETERSON OIL CO EQUIPMENT. WHILE NO EVIDENCE OF NEGLECT OR WRONGDOING WAS FOUND BY PETERSON OIL CO OR THE DRIVER, PETERSON OIL CO FINDS ITS DRIVERS SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS ON THE ROAD TO BE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE. IN ORDER TO PREVENT POSSIBLY RECURRENCE OF ANY TYPE OF ACCIDENT, PETERSON OIL CO TOOK SEVERAL DIFFERENT APPROACHES, IN OUR BEST ATTEMPT, TO PREVENT POSSIBLY RECURRENCE OF A DRIVER ACCIDENT. IN AN ATTEMPT TO ENSURE THE MOST CAPABLE DRIVING, THE DRIVER INVOLVED WAS TEMPORARILY FORCED INTO A PASSENGER POSITION WHEN RETURNING TO WORK AT PETERSON OIL CO. THE DRIVER, HAVING BI-WEEKLY MEETINGS WITH PETERSON OIL CO MANAGEMENT, WAS ASKED TO GIVE HONEST FEEDBACK ON HIS READINESS TO RETURN AS DRIVER OF PETERSON OIL CO EQUIPMENT. A MORE SENIOR EMPLOYEE WAS THEN ASSIGNED AS A PASSENGER AND THEN ASKED TO REPORT ON DRIVING CONDITIONS AND HABITS OF INVOLVED DRIVER. THE REPORTS FOUND NORMAL, SAFE DRIVING HABITS. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NORMAL HUMAN ERROR CONTRIBUTED TO WRECK. IN A FURTHER ATTEMPT TO ENSURE ALL DRIVERS SAFETY PETERSON OIL CO IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH IT INSURANCE COMPANY TO PROVIDE TRAINING AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SAFETY MEETINGS.",Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,40765,PETERSON OIL CO,US,

I SAW A PIECE OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE ANGLE IRON COME OFF THE UNIT AND BOUNCE IN MY LANE. I WAS ABLE TO AVOID HITTING IT WAS THE STEER TIRES WITH A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT. I HAD CARS IN THE NEXT LANE ON DRIVERS SIDE AND FREEWAY SHOULDER ON PASSENGER SIDE. I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE ANY AGGRESSIVE MOVEMENTS AS I WAS LOADED. I FELT THE METAL HIT THE UNDERNEATH OF MY TRACTOR. MAYBE HITTING THE DRIVER LINE AS I HEARD A THUMP AND FELT A SHOCK IN THE CAB OF MY TRUCK. I CHECKED MY MIRRORS ON BOTH SIDES IMMEDIATELY. AFTER A FEW SECONDS I NOTICED MY TIRES ON PASSENGER SIDE OF TRAILER COMING APART. I SAW HUNKS OF AT LEAST ONE TIRE FLYING APART. I IMMEDIATELY SLOWED AND LOOKED FOR A SAFE PLACE TO GET OFF THE FREEWAY. FORTUNATELY, THERE WAS AN AREA DIRECTLY AHEAD THAT ALLOWED FOR ME TO GET OUT OF THE TRAFFIC AREA. I STOPPED THE UNIT AND PUT ON MY EMERGENCY FLASHERS AND WENT TO INSPECT THE REAR OF THE TRAILER. I WENT TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE TRAILER WHEN I SAW SMOKE COMING FROM UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER. I RAN BACK AND GOT MY FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND RETURNED TO THE BACK OF THE TRAILER. I SAW ONE TIRE ON FIRE AND THE OTHER ONE BLOWN OUT. THE TIRE THAT CAME APART HAD APPEARED TO HAVE SOME OF IT WRAPPED AROUND THE AXLE AND WAS ON FIRE. I ASKED AN AMBULANCE CREW THAT HAD STOPPED TO CALL 911 AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND PROCEEDED TO DO MY BEST TO PUT THE FIRE OUT. I EVENTUALLY USED UP ALL MY FIRE EXTINGUISHERS (2) AND WAS NOT ABLE TO PUT OUT THE FIRE. IT SEEMED LIKE IT TOOK FOREVER FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO ARRIVE. MAYBE 10 OR 12 MINUTES AND WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY SAID IT WAS SAFER TO GET EVERYONE AWAY AND LET IT BURN. I SUGGESTED HITTING IT WITH WATER TO PUT THE FIRE OUT BUT THEY SAID ""THE POLICY WAS TO STAY BACK"". FINALLY AFTER ABOUT 4 HOURS THEY SPRAYED UNIT WITH FOAM AND PUT OUT THE LAST OF THE FIRE. I GAVE REPORTS TO THE CHP AND FIRE DEPARTMENT ON SCENE. NO OTHER PARTIES WERE INVOLVED AND NO PRODUCT SPILLED FORM THE TRAILER. IT WAS A TERRIBLE FEELING TO SEE MY NEW TRUCK AND TRAILER TO BURN DOWN TO NOTHING.",NO COMMENTS PROVIDED.,Yes,,Cargo tanks,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,38955,WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION INC,US,
