Compartment 1 was loaded with no issues.  When compartment #2 was loading, our Driver noticed material leaking from the valve.  The driver stooped loading after about 200 gallons was put into the compartment.  He noticed that there were a 2 bolts missing from the inner valve on compartment #2.  Our Driver along with a couple of employees from the Quality Terminal were able to tighten the rest of the bolts and install the 2 bolts that were missing.  About 50 gallons drained into the site spill control area.  After the bolts were installed and the rest were secure, there was no leakage.  The remaining 150 gallosn was put back into the rail car.  The tanker had just been in our local repair shop, Truck Services of Virginia for repair of the inner valve.  The tanker was picked up on Monday as completed.  In short, the shop did not tighten up the bolts as they should have and they must have vibrated lose on the trip to SC.  Once we got the truck back to Virginia, compartment 1 was of loaded, tanker purged and it was sent back to the shop for reapir.  We picked up the tanker on June 5th along with a report that said all bolts were replaced and tighten to current spec.","When I returned to the office on June 5th and was told of the incident, I called Truck Services of Virginia and expressed my concerns.

When the tote is full the operator signals to driver to shut down pump before the operator can shut his valve. on the filling of the first tote, the operator signald to driver to shut down pump the driver was not ready and failed to disingage the PTO for the pump. the operator closed his valve, pressure continued to build in the hoses, the coupling end on one of the hose failed and parted from the hose resulting in the spill. spilled material was contained and within 45 minutes was cleaned up and a replacement hose was placed in service. Delivery was completed without incident.",1) The driver needed to remain in the cab of the tractor to disengage the PTO to stop the pump. The driver gave the operator permission to start but failed to position himself properly to respond to the operator's command. 2) The internal by-pass on this pump might have pervented the release if it were operational. This was determined after the incident when the pump was cleamed and sent out for inspection.  3) The hose in question is also being inspected and may have been damaged prior to use.

The carrier opened the doors to the trailer and noticed that one of the 55 gallon drums over preasurized and popped split open the drum at the top seam and sprayed materail on the side wall and ceiling of the trailer as well as over some other drums that were in close proximate.   The carrier immediately contacted Kevin Homer.  Once Kevin did a quick initial assessment he had the carrier pull back into the dock so that we could better access the situation at hand.   After the carrier backed back into the dock.  We identified the drum that split open at the top  and was able to get the profile and decided to call in an outside clean up crew.

Upon inspection of the load, it was discovered that 4 of the containers showed evidence of external staining that signified an inner container either broke of opened in transit puncturing the inner liner and soaking into the fiberboard container wall.  Facility personnel immediately halted transfer operation and initated a clean-up operation.  A field Service crew was assembled to repackage the individual containers into appropriate non-bulk packages for continued transportation.  In addition, the contaminated intermediate bulk packages were dismantled and sent for disposal at a licensed waste management facility along with all clean-up debris.","The cause of the incident was attributed to incorrect package preparation.  The choice of an intermediate bulk package for inner containers was performed in error as the material should have been packaged in an appropriate non bulk package.  In additon, sufficient cushioning/absorbent was not used allowing the liquid to soak into the containers material of construction.

Propylene loading volume measurement is accomplished by flowing propylene through a metering tube that utilizes the Coriolis effect to provide accurate volume measurements.  The meter tube output is supervised by a computer that provides information to the loading operator.  Additionally, loading volumes are verified by the position of an indicator rod on the propylene railcar.  This rod provides the relative amount of unloaded volume remaining in the railcar.    As the railcar loading was nearing completion, operations personnel noted that the indicator rod changed position from approximately 30 inches to almost 0 inches within a few minutes.  Loading activities on TILX 302170 were stopped immediately and operations personnel retrieved information from the supervisory computer to determine the loaded volume.  The supervisory computer indicated that the railcar had been loaded with approximately 100,057 pound of propylene compared to a fully loaded volume of approximately 120,000 pounds.      The behavior of the railcar indicator rod coupled with conflicting supervisory computer level output resulted in a decision that the railcar quantity needed verification by weighing on the facility complex railcar scales.  The railcar was disconnected from the loading platform and was moved along the rail to the scales within the facility complex.  The railcar scale output indicated that the car was overweight.  Instructions were provided to return the railcar to the loading platform for offloading.    Ambient temperature conditions were extremely high, approaching 100 degrees F with abundant sunshine.    A facility employee observed a small amount of gaseous material escape from the dome area of the loaded railcar.  Williams’ representatives responded to the tank car location.  EPA Method 21 testing verified that the relief valve had re-seated.    Near midday on 6-23-09 TILX 302170 arrived at the loading platform to be positioned for offloading.  At this time, ambient temperature levels were near 100 degrees F.  At approximately 1 P.M. as operations was making connections to offload, the railcar relief valve briefly actuated again.    Connections were completed and railcar offloading began.  No further releases occurred.",Two action items are underway.  1)  The propylene meter tube performance is being closely monitored and will be replaced if warranted.   2)  The railcar was offloaded and will be transported to Trinity Rail for examination and maintenance.    Operations followed safe and appropriate procedures by immediately shutting off flow to the railcar when the level indicator rod abruptly changed position.  Williams will review this event with Operations personnel.,No,TANK CAR,Pressure,112JW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Williams Olefins LLC,US,

It processed and forwarded by air to PHX. The final destination of the shipment was FLL. When the aircraft arrived in FLL at approximately 17:40 on June 13, 2009, the forward baggage compartment was opened and the cargo agent detected the smell of fuel. The source of the smell was determined to be one of the three boxes that appeared to be fuel soaked. FLL personnel stated that there was no actual leakage from the box.The aircraft was reloaded and dispatched as flight 181 FLL-PHX. After the aircraft departed, FLL personnel notified the OCC and explained that flumes were detected when the ramp agent opened the baggage compartment, OCC made the decision to divert the flight to IAH for safety reasons.We are still in the process of collection information, by it appears that the spare boat parts were not professionally cleaned and purged of residual fuel before they were shipped. This shipment was screened via X-ray and the shipper signed off on the air waybill stating it contained no hazardous materials. The shipment is being held at the FLL cargo facility.

The product flow into the tank slowed and then stopped.  The driver, closed the internal valve on tanker unit, waited approximatly 12 minutes for product to drain from the drop hose.  The driver then removed the drop fitting from the UST and as a result of back pressure in the UST product flowed out of the fill pipe on the UST onto the ground.  Product flowed into a storm drain and over to a second strom drain on the property.  Clean-up and containment efforts were begun by the driver.  Then an HM Response contractor arrived and cleaned the product out of the storm drains and flused entire area and vacummed up the product.  The cause of the pressure in the UST is because of a failure of the vapor line ball float vent valve. At the end of the valve is a 3"" ball float that was lodged in the vapor tube.  The ball float did not descend from the vapor line allowing the vapor to leave the UST and go back to the tanker, this caused the build up of pressure in the UST.","First the defective Ball Float Vent Valve was replaced in the UST.

The working pressure on the cargo tank was 265 psi. The driver proceeded to his destination.  Just before arriving at his destination the releif valve releaved the pressure on the cargo tank.  The driver was awear of the release of the product and was in the middle of traffic and a heavy populated area.  He continued to a safe area before pulling over which was about a mile from his destination. By the time he stopped the truck the releif valve had releaved the pressure and reseated. This is what the releif valve is designed to do.  The tempature outside was 100 degree. We thank the releif valve may have releaved a bit early. The product was off loaded at the plant and cargo tank was taken to the main shop to have the releif valve changed out and tested.  The releif valve releaved pressure for about 5 minutes.  We think about 300 gallons was released in vapors.,The cargo tank is being tested and the releif valve is being replaced to prevent this incident from occuring again.,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,Dufour Petroleum LP,US,

Facility personnel placed the leaking container into a salvage drum.  The released material was absorbed and all clean-up and decontamination debris was placed in the salvage drum.  The container was then trans loaded and sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking was observed.

Conway Driver Ed Bailey drove into the trailer and grabbed the pallet from underneath the load rack, backed away from the rack and raised the pallet up for inspection and noticed a puddle of blue ink in the spot where the pallet had been. Upon further inspection of the pallet, he first looked underneath the pallet to see if there was any fork damage which there was not. He then noticed that the ink was leaking from a drum that was on top of the pallet, sitting directly beside the top of a 55 gallon drum. The 5 gallon pail was pushed into the 55 gallon drum by excessive and very tight shrink wrap, most likely a machine wrap. The pail was dented in direct correlation with the top of the 55 gallon drum, with a tear in the pail approximately 1"" long and 1/8"" wide, where the ink leaked out.The ink spilled out along the sides of the inner pails on the pallet onto the trailer floor. Approximately 3-4 gallons leaked from the pail. The ink was partly dry and partly wet which makes me believe this started leaking shortly after leaving the origin terminal. (Transit time 24 hours)","Future shipments in which a small and large pails get loaded together should either have some cardboard or other protective material in between the pails, or to make sure that when the drums are shrink wrapped , that there is monitoring as to how tight the wrap gets wrapped to the pallet, when a machine is doing the wrapping.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CON-WAY FREIGHT,US,

(EWMI) lab pack chemist and driver (Erik Brown) arrived at Delta Circuits (shipper/offerer) in Fairfield NJ to receive and transport a tote of Corrosive Waste Liquid (Sodium Hydroxide) UN3266. Delta Circuits personnel pumped the material from a poly open top tank into the 275 gallon tote (1BC 31HA1). The original scope of work understood by EWMI was to bring a container to allow Delta Circuits to take material out of an on site tank for shipment off site. Delta Circuits personnel wanted to add more material to the tote but this was not authorized by EWMI personnel. Delta Circuits continued to add a drum of the same waste material to the tote and then added 20 to 30 gallons of a copper sulfate <80% and formaldehyde <15% mixture premix solution (1120A Premix, Fidelity Chemical Products Corp.) to the tote. Delta personnel emptied the entire contents from the 55 gallon container of 1 120A Premix into the tote, closed the package and then loaded the tote onto the truck. The tote was secured down by EWMI lab pack chemist Erik Brown. Approximately 30 minutes latter while traveling on Interstate 80 west Erik heard a load bang and promptly pulled over to discover a liquid seeping from the truck. Upon inspection Erik discovered the tote had ruptured at the surface and caused a rip in the tote approximately 2V2 feet in length. An estimated ten gallons leaked out from the tote. The spill was immediately contained with supplies from the vehicles emergency spill kit. The spill was called in and a spill response team was dispatched to the scene. The tote ruptured at the one side on top of the tote. The elapsed time from the moment the driver heard the bang to the time that the rupture was noted and addressed was approximately a minute.",NO COMMENT PROVIDED,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5100,EWMI,US,

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders immediately inspected HOKX 8305 and determined that residue product drips were emanating from a weep hole near the sump area. A receptacle was placed under HOKX 8305 and it was cordoned off in the railyard. BNSF contract responders plugged this weep hole. It was suspected that an internal liner breach resulted in residue product entering the weep hole area. A neutralizing mixture of soda ash and water was applied to residue product splashes on HOKX 8305 and an entrained adjacent railcar. All noted spillage that impacted the ballast area was also neutralized.  Afterwards, contract responders inserted the neutralizing solution inside HOKX 8305. The remaining neutralized content within HOKX 8305 was then vacuumed out. This material was placed in a poly tank which was later transported to the consignee for appropriate disposal. FRA movement approval FRA-09070284 was received for continued transportation back to the car owner consignee.

The leak was from a small (< 3"") crack that had developed above a welded seam on the container.  Approximately 712 gallons of HCI was released onto the Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems (ALS) yard in Buckhannon, WV.  The National Response Center, the local fire department and the Upshur County Emergency Management Office were notified of the spill, and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection was notified.  The WVDEP oversaw the clean up activities conducted by Ryan Environmental on the behalf of Weatherford.  The release, limited to the Weatherford Property, was neutralized by the addition of soda ash and the affected soil was excavated and placed in lined roll off boxes pending disposal at an approved disposal facility. Confirmation samples were collected to verify that the clean up had been completed.  Based on the analytical results, no further additional action is required.",Weatherford Artificial Lift Systems is conducting a Root Cause Analysis of the incident.

Rob stated that New Mexico Trooper called PST and said that our driver Joshua McAninch, traveling with a Westerh Refining Butane Load, from Bloomfield, NM with a destination of Western Refining El Paso, TX, was involved in a one vehicle rollover at approximately 7:17am Mountain Time; Location of accident; New Mexico, Interstate 25, Mile Marker #177. I then called New Mexico Sergeant Trooper Jason Green (575-835-0741) and New Mexico State Patrol Dispatch Marsha Roby (575-835-0741) to get details, Joshua was traveling Southbound an Interstate 25, when he apparently fell asleep, veered into the median, and overturned a loaded Butane Trailer (8666) & Tractor (87013). Trooper stated Joshua had been treated by EMS at the scene, and was transported to University of New Mexico Hospital. I then called PST Dispatch for help with finding another Driver with a pressurized bottle to possibly assist with unloading overturned Unit. FST HR Theresa Ford was notified and attempted calling (JNM Hospital to learn more of Joshua’s condition. FST driver Archie Carranza appeared to be the closest available unit, where he was currently unloading in Las Vegas, NM. I then called Sergeant Jason Green and told him we were arranging for our Unit to travel to Crash Site for offloading. He stated New Mexico HazMat had not been contacted, due to no release of Hazardous Material. Archic was running short of On Duty/Driving Hours, so I called for only available relief FST driver, Christine Lopez. Archic was directed to Crash site at 9:30am Central Time. FST Mechanic Ben Douglas was instructed to load proper unloading hoses, etc. and travel to Crash Site. Ben left at approximately 9:00am Central, I waited for Christine to arrive at Amarillo Yard, and we left at approximately 10:30 am Central, I had Mike MCDonald print last seven days of Joshua’s Driver Log. Arabic was first to arrive at scene at 12:30pm Central Time, and staged his tractor/trailer on North Bound side of 1-25 at nearest point of Crash Site. 1-25 Traffic by this time had been narrowed down to one lane on both North/South travel lanes. Approximately l0:32am Central Time; I persnally called New Mexico Department of Environmental Quality Frank R.odarte (505-428-2525), left message, and at approximately 10:37am Central Time, I also calld New Mexico DEQ Sandra Marlin (505-222-9547), left message, to report this incident, but never received a return call from either contacts. Made a call to Joshua’s wife 915-929-3698) at approximately 1:15pm, and left message for her to have Joshua call ne when possible, because it was necessary to complete a Post-Accident Alcohol Test Within eight hours of accident. Never received a return call. Christine lopez & I arrived at Crash Site at approximately 2:30pm Mountain Time.

Highland Road,Twinsburg,OH,44087,Other-Regional Regulatory Mana,"A Univar USA Inc. employee was driving a forklift and in the process of unloading an IBC from a Univar USA Inc. delivery box trailer spotted at the warehouse dock.  Due to the narrow dock door width, uneven level between trailer and dock floor and the IBC was at the rear of the trailer, the forklift had to approach the IBC at an angle.   The employee accidently punctured the IBC bottle with the forklift blade, near the IBC bottom.  This caused an 8 inch gash in the IBC bottle.   An estimated 138 gallons of product was released to the dock containment system and nearby catch basin.  No material was released to soil or water.  A response contractor was called in to vacuum up spilled material and to decontaminate surface areas.  The estimated release time was a few minutes.  Remedial actions were ongoing for six hours.",Two corrective actions will be taken to prevent recurrence:  1. Forklift refresher training will be conducted.  2.

The cargo tank was discovered to be leaking while parked there on their scales.  Plant personnel contacted Phillip Services who in turn sent two 70 barrel vaccuum trucks to the scales and removed the product from our cargo tank.      As the product was being unloaded, the leak increased in intensity and leaked 60 gallons of product onto the scales before all of the product was removed.  Plant personnel contained the product to their scales and cleaned up all of the spilled product.      The cargo tank was spotted in the plant until it stopped dripping then was cleaned and taken to Bulleye Tank in Houston, TX to locate the leak.  The leak originated from a pit in the barrel of the tank and has too many pits to be repaired so it was removed from service.  The cargo tank will now be sold for scrap.","Continue testing the cargo tanks as required by the regulations.  All of the test dates were within the acceptable range, VIK - 06/2008, T - 06/2007 and P - 06/2008.

He released the pressure and the drips slowed down.  Our spill response vendor, HMHTTC,  was called out to the scene.  The incident was reported to the state police who had said that the load needed to be transferred.  HMHTTC was able to determine that the bolts were loose.

On that day at 9:05 a.m. Mr. Tagliamburis was in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He called and spoke to me. He stated that he had conducted a walk around inspection and noticed approximately half a gallon of catalyst under the second bin on the right side. I asked Mr. Tagliamburis if any substance was on the ground. He replied, “No, it’s under the bin opening”.   After my conversation with Mr. Tagliamburis I called ASTE and spoke to Joyce. I infonned Joyce that a bin was showing some leakage but was not leaking while it was parked. Joyce informed me that she would call Wes at Conoco Phillips in Billings, Montana, which is where the load was generated. Joyce called me back shortly thereafter and stated that she had spoke to Wes and he ask if the leakage was enough to be reported. It was determined by Joyce and I, based on Mr. Tagliamburis’ description of the amount of the leakage, that the leakage amounted to less than a pound. I instructed Mr.   Tagliamburis to safely clean the area and put the leakage in a steel bucket with a lid. I also instructed him to check the door to make sure that it was completely closed with locks in place. John stated that he could not close the door anymore and couldn’t see the locks. It was then decided that since it was not showing any leakage while stopped, Mr. Tagliamburis could continue on. I repeatedly attempted to call Mr. Tagliamburis but was unable to reach him due to a lack of cell phone signal in that region.   The next morning, June 25th, 2009,1 called Mr. Tagliamburis. He reported that while enroute he had cleaned up a total of 4 ‘/2 gallons of leakage into the steel bucket. It was then decided that we would make a second door against the lip of the opening of the door. I then called Joyce at ASH. and informed her on the status of the load and how we had put a second door on the bin to eliminate the loss and that there might be a gallon that was between the bins that we could not get until the bins were removed or picked up. I then called the owner of Pride Transportation, Inc., Jim Kilgore, and asked him if he wanted us to continue with the load and plan on the remaining leakage to be cleaned between the bins upon delivery. Mr. Kilgore instructed me to instruct Mr. Tagliamburis to continue with his planned delivery.   Mr. Tagliamburis called me the next morning at his delivery destination, Porocel Catalyst Recovery. He told me that everything was fine with the load, Porocel Catalyst   Recovery signed the bills and cleaned the leakage on the floor. Mr. Tagliamburis told me to call and speak to Sean at Porocel. I asked Mr. Tagliamburis if anything was written by Porocel on lines 18 and 1 8a showing a discrepancy. Mr. Tagliamburis stated there was","WE AT PRIDE TRANSPORTATION INC. WILL AT THIS TIME HAND OUT THE LOCK DIAGREAMS TO OUR DRIVERS AND EXPLAIN THE SYSTEM TO THEM SO THAT THIS LOCKING SYSTEM CAN BE CHECKED BY DRIVERS AS A BACK UP AND FOR SECURITY REASONS.

He said that he “Did Not, Bill Walters didn’t know it was in there, it was for a home project”.

Upon offloading the middle belly of the aircraft it was found that one piece of US MAIL was leaking.     The USPS was not immediately available to respond to the incident to open the mail sack.  The aircraft was to turn flight 444 outbound to BOS.  The spill resulted in the need to change equipment.      The mail sack was eventually opened where it was revealed that this box was clearly marked ""liquid"" on the outside of the box and a customs declaration for Canada was filled out and indicated ""insecticide"".  The box was placed inside an orange mail sack, therefore American Airlines was not aware of the contents being tendered by the USPS.    Upon opening of the mail sack there were three items found packaged in the box.  The item that had leaked was a one gallon container of Tengard SFR One Shot Insecticide.  Approximately 1 pint of the liquid had spilled.  MSDS of the product indicates that it is not regulated as per 173.150(f) when shipped by highway in non-bulk containers.  However, when shipped via air it should be transported under UN1993, Flammable liquid, n.o.s (hydrocarbon), hazard class 3, PGIII.      There were two other materials inside the box that did not leak.  One was Prentox ExciteR, transport information states, NA1993, Combustible liquid, n.o.s. (Petroleum Naptha), PGIII, RQ (Pyrethrins).  The last material inside the package was a package of 20 of Summit Bti Briquets (mosquito dunks).  This material does not indicate to be regulated for transport.    The material was cleaned up by Eagle Construction and Environmental Services.      Due to the slow response of the USPS, the clean up for this event was not concluded until approximately 1500, resulting in the aircraft being out of service for approximately 5 1/2 hours.","All triggers were on the box at time of tender from customer to the USPS.  The box was labeled ""liquid"" and the customs release was attached to the box with contents indicating ""insecticide"".  Perhaps better training for personnel to catch ""triggers"" to ask questions on the items being shipped, and better education to the customer who was shipping the insecticides.
