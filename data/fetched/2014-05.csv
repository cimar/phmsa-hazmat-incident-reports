The shipment was being placed in the 10-day dock at the Veolia facility located at 9131 E. 96th Ave., Henderson, CO 80640 when the leak was discovered. A health and safety plan was completed and reviewed before emergency response work/clean up was conducted.  Floor dry was placed over the liquid that leaked on the ground.  The spill was contained and the material was repackaged into 3 x 55 gallon steel drums.  The clean up PPE and debris was placed into 2 x cubic yard boxes and profiled as debris from clean up of plating sludge.  The cubic yard box that failed contained liquid and the liquid leaked during transit.  The packaging was not rated for liquids resulting in a packaging failure and leak.  The spill was a non RQ spill.  The plating waste is comprised of 1% chromium, 1% cadmium, 0-30% caustic soda, 0-30% 5/1 salt, and 0-30% 5/2 polymer.  The RQ for cadium is 10 lbs and the RQ for chromium 5,000.  The volume of the spill did not warrant an RQ.  One pound spilled onto the ground and 1% of one pound is 0.1 lbs for the spill.",The generator was contacted to ensure the waste is dry before placing into the Cubic Yard boxes for any shipments moving forward.

All concerned were notified.  KCS dispatched a hazmat responder.  Upon arrival the responder discovered that the packing gland nut was two turns loose. The packing gland nut was tightened appropriately by the responder. It was not repacked. There was no defect found with the bottom outlet valve.  It appears that the root cause stems from the unloader or loader failing to retighten, and further, the shipper (loader) failing to identify the loose BOV packing gland nut before offering this hazmat tank car into transportation.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.      (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

The BOV was cleaned with degreaser and the flange bolts tightened. Clean sorbent pads were subsequently placed under the BOV and checked after some time to verify that the leak had stopped.     File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.

Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

The liquid valve connection was tight. This valve was removed to examine its threaded area. The responder reported that the sealant applied to its threads was dry and thus under performing as a good sealant. The responder cleaned the threaded area and applied new sealant to its threaded area. The liquid valve was then re-secured. Non-evaporating spillage was wiped.

UTLX 202912 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard. Contract responders inspecting UTLX 202912 reported finding the 3 inch threaded liquid valve in the closed position but its closure plug was not tool tight. Responders concluded that the commodity leak emanated from the closure plug orifice. The responder's inspection of the ball valve via the valve's port closure revealed commodity accumulating at the ball valve seat (liquid bypassing this closed valve). This commodity accumulation was absorbed/removed from around the valve seat. The liquid valve's closure plug was reapplied and properly tool tightened. No further commodity leakage was observed afterwards. All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure. The streaks of spillage on UTLX 202912's side shell were wiped.

PLCX 220330 was cordoned-off awaiting inspection. Response by the Great Falls F.D. with their Haz Team and near-by consignee responders concurred with the inspection results by contract responders that the threaded vapor valve (VV) was the odor/vapor release source. The VV was loose on its riser pipe nipple's threaded connection into the valve housing plate atop the tank car. Also, the VV's closure plug was not tool tight on this closed valve. The aforementioned securement deficiencies allowed residue commodity odor/vapors to escape at this unsecured vapor valve. The responders applied Teflon tape to the exposed VV pipe nipple threads and tool tightened it. The VV closure plug was also tool tightened after Teflon tape was applied to its threaded connection. After PLCX 220330's VV was secured, the residue commodity odor dissipated. Also, non-detectable residue commodity vapor levels on the contract responder's air monitoring devices were also observed.

The drum was so severely bulged that Veolia EH&S deemed the drum and trailer it was on unsafe to be near by all personnel.     At 16:00, the drum top was completely blown off of the drum due to the excessive pressure that had built up in the drum.  One gallon of paint related material was released onto the trailer floor and on the top of other drums that were in the same trailer.    The drum was overpacked into a 85 gal steel drum and shipped to the destination facility for disposal.  The material that spilled was cleaned up and sent to a proper waste disposal facility.","The shipper, General Electric Company, will monitor drums of the same waste type on site for one week prior to shipment.

It had rained quite heavily recently but the boxes appeared OK at the time of pick up. The following morning, a Veolia employee was checking the vehicle containing the boxes that had been parked at the Veolia office overnight. He noticed a couple of boxes had become wet at their lowest point overnight. He called EH&S and the customer to report the issue and ask for guidance on how to proceed. He obtained assistance and opened the containers for further inspection. There was a significant amount of rainwater that was trapped in the liner of the boxes and it had started leaking through the liner and through the fiberboard onto the floor of the vehicle and less than a gallon below the vehicle. He took photographs of the issue, cleaned up all liquid that had leaked out of boxes, absorbed all loose liquid in the boxes, and repackaged all boxes, and sent out for appropriate disposal at the requested TSDF.

MR. TIRSO BELTRAIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (EMI) RECEIVED A CALL FROM MR. JEFF MESSER OF CON-WAY TRUCKLOAD, INC. (CTI). MR. MESSER INFORMED MR. BELTRAIN THAT A CTI DRIVER HAD REPORTED THAT IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT CARGO IN A TRAILER COULD BE POSSIBLY LEAKING. THE CARGO CONSISTED OF CLASS 8, AND CLASS 5.1(8) MATERIALS.  THESE MATERIALS WERE PACKAGED IN 55 GALLON, 30-GALLON, 15-GALLON AND 5-GALLON CONTAINERS. AT THE TIME IT WAS NOT KNOWN WHICH PRODUCT(S) WERE LEAKING. THE AMOUNT OF THE RELEASE WAS NOT KNOWN. MR. MESSER REQUESTED THAT MR. BELTRAN MOBILIZE A RESPONSE TEAM TO THE LOCATION OF THE TRACTOR-TRAILER UNIT TO INVESTIGATE THE MATTER AND PERFORM ANY NECCESSARY CLEANUP IF REQUIRED. MR. BELTRAN CONTACTED PATRIOT ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES (PES), AN EMI APPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL SUBCONTRACTOR, AND REQUESTED THAT A RESPONSE TEAM BE MOBILIZED TO THE SITE. PES PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT NO MATERIAL HAD IMPACTED THE ASPHALT SURFACE OF THE PARKING LOT. NO STORM DRAINS OR NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS WERE IMPACTED. PES THEN OPENED THE TRAILER DOORS. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT ALL THE CONTAINERS WEER PALLETIZED. PES PERSONNEL THEN ENTERED THE TRAILER TO VISUALLY INSPECT THE CONTAINERS. SIX ROWS FROM THE REAR OF THE TRAILER, A 55-GALLON POLY DRUM CONTAINING SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE SOLUTION WAS FOUND TO HAVE A PUNCTURE HOLE (APPROXIMATELY 1/4 INCH IN DIAMETER) ON THE SIDE, APPROXIMATELY 6 INCHES FROM THE TOP OF THE DRUM. THE CAUSE OF THE PUNCTURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME. A SMALL AMOUNT (APPROXIMATELY 1/2 CUP) HAD BEEN RELEASED AND IMPACTED A SMALL AREA ON THE TRAILER FLOOR. THE PALLETS OF UNDAMAGED CONTAINERS WERE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER TRAILER (PROVIDED BY CTI) TO ACCESS THE LEAKING DRUM. THE DAMAGED DRUM WAS THEN PLACED INTO A 95-GALLON POLL OVERPACK DRUM. THE POLY OVERPACK DRUM WAS THEN PROPERLY LABELED AND PLACED ON A CLEAN PALLET. A SODA ASH SOLUTION WAS THEN UTILIZED TO NEUTRALIZE AND CLEAN THE SMALL AREA ON THE TRAILER FLOOR. ONCE THE TRAILER FLOOR WAS CLEAN, THE PALLETS OF UNDAMAGED CONTAINERS WERE TRANSFERRED BACK INTO THE ORIGINAL TRAILER. THE LOAD WAS SECURED, AND THE UNIT WAS RELEASED BACK TO THE DRIVER.","Continue our on going efforts in driver safety/spill prevention training in preventing incidents as these from happening. Stress how important that pre and post inspections are performed. By the driver performing the pre inspection, the incident was minor.

Immediate inspection by a BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder of GATX 79950 determined that the leak source was at the liquid valve's bolted mounting flange connection. The responder reported finding all 4 stud bolt nuts on the liquid valve's flange connection loose (each approximately 5 full turns loose) which allowed some commodity to escape at this unsecured flange connection. The responder tool tightened these loose stud bolt nuts. Spillage on the valve housing plate was wiped along with spillage on the top side shell. Afterwards, no further commodity leakage at this mounting flange connection was observed. Intact shipper seal at the valve housing cover was replaced by BNSF seal 06157716.

Immediate inspection of NATX 300412 by a BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder revealed that its liquid valve was partially open with its valve's port closure plug not tool tight. The responder closed the liquid valve and properly secured the closure plug after applying new Teflon tape to its threaded areas. The liquid valve's operating handle positioned in the full closed position obstructed the valve housing cover's proper closure. The liquid valve's operating handle was then removed and placed in the valve housing area. The valve housing cover was fully closed and sealed with seal BNSF 174355.

SEKEL,LOGISTICS & CUSTOMER CARE MANAGER,MARGARET & BERMUDA STREETS,Philadelphia,PA,19137,Shipper,"Incident Facts  On May 21st, 2014 at around 2:45PM Acetone overflowed from an Acetone Truck that was being loaded from VT-629.  The initial TER indicated that the release amount was 1 gallon.  However, further investigation revealed that the release may have been as high as 110gals. The Tier 2 Threshold Quantity for Acetone is 34gals and this event has been classified as a Tier 2 Process Safety Event.    Background Information  On May 21st a truck was sent to the Frankford Plant to load 6,777gals for Momentive Specialty Chemicals.  The truck had a capacity of 6,500gals.  Through discussions with the Shipper, it was discovered that order amounts often exceed the capacity of the trucks. The Shipper indicated that he misread the truck capacity as 6,700gals.  The truck capacity is determined by the Shipper inspecting the stamped capacity on the truck.  This number is often difficult to read. The Shipper set the loading meter to 6,600gals.  It is standard practice to set the loading meter at 100gals less than the capacity of the truck when the order amount exceeds the truck capacity.  As the truck approached the end of its load, the Shipper returned to the platform and was waiting for the process to complete.  The Shipper heard a noise which was followed by the inflatable hatch seal pushing up and allowing Acetone to be released from the side.  The hatch seal system is bolted in place and did not become completely disengaged.     Corrective Response  Upon identifying the release, the Shipper immediately closed the manual valve to the loading arm.  This stopped the flow and the release of material.  Once the overflow stopped, the Shipper pressed the emergency stop button to stop the loading pump from running.  The Shipper estimated that the release amount was 50 to 70 gallons. The area was washed down with water by the Shipper to remove the volatile material.  He attempted to contact the Transportation Manager, but he was unable to report to the scene due to an audit that was being performed.  The Operations Supervisor (25) reported to the scene to review the incident.  The Operations Supervisor estimated that the release was one gallon because he did not see any material on the ground or on the truck.  However, he did not ask the Shipper for an estimated release amount.",Recommendations - Root Cause (Entered into ETS)  1.Reactivate the Acetone truck loading high level shutdown meters   2.Standardize how the Shipper sets the meter based on order amount and truck capacity.  Include reviewing the process of setting the meter 100gals below the capacity of the truck   3.Revaluate the process of obtaining the truck capacity and make recommendations as needed.  Involve multiple shippers in this review     Recommendations - Additional Findings (Entered into IMPACT)  1.Clearly define and communicate the proper response and communication of a Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC) Event     2.Clearly define the responsibilities of the Operations Supervisor and the Logistics Manager in regards to oversight of the day to day shipping activities     3.Assess and recommend potential on all High Level Shutdowns across all loading operations for all chemicals,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,HONEYWELL,US,

They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O. Box 219335, Kansas City, MO 64121. The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,THE KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN RAILWAY COMPANY,US,

KIRK HIGBIE,DIRECTOR OF SAFETY & ENVIROMMENTAL,8934 Manchester St,Houston,TX,77012,Carrier,"On Sunday, May 25, 2014 at approximately 1915 hours PTRA Job281 Foreman reported that he observed product leak from the top of GATX 2833 while switching rail cars in PTRA Penn City Yard. PTRA Trainmaster Brashear responded to the scene and determined that the car was leaking from the pressure relief valve.  The car was waybilled to Merisol located approximately 1500 feet North of Penn City yard.  After consulting with PTRA Safety Director Higbie and Merisol representative Henderson the decision was made to safely move the car into Merisol under 49CFR174.50 where Merisol could isolate the car and get GATX to come out and make repairs. The rail car shows being spotted on the customer track at 2246 hours.    Merisol reported that GATX replaced the PRV and tested the car on June 3, 2014 and released by Merisol.",At this time we do not know what triggered the failure in the PRV.  GATX is evaluating the device. The PTRA does not know if the shipper was contacted by Merisol to notify them of the issues with the PRV. Merisol's assistance with the car and agreement to recieve the car with the faulty PRV significantly reduced the chances of further release and other potential issues.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Port Terminal Railroad Association,US,

The cause of this derailment was attributed to lateral drawbar force on curve excessive due to car geometry. GATX 81889 derailed towards its side with its bottom outlet valve (BOV) damaged (sheared off) releasing commodity. The local F.D. and BNSF mechanical responders were able to position a wooden plug at the BOV's exposed orifice which ended the release of escaping commodity. Containment was placed under the BOV while GATX 81889 was awaiting commodity transfer into another suitable tank car. The observed ground impact area of spillage was excavated. The excavated sites were backfilled with native soil and then clean rock ballast applied atop. The ground impact areas were also sampled for traces of any remaining commodity presence.    On 6/13/2014, contract responders transferred the commodity within GATX 81889 into another suitable tank car without further incident.

The load shifted suddenly to the front of the trailer.  The batteries were packed on pallets and when the load shifted the heavy batteries slammed into each other causing the plastic housing on some of the batteries to crack.  The batteries were filled with sulfuric acid and this acid started to leak into the trailer after the load shifted.       Nassau County Hazmat Team was called to the site to do the initial clean up and containment.  Miller Environmental Group was also dispatched to the scene to do the final clean up.  Soda Ash and water was used to neutralize the acid that had leaked into the trailer and out onto the roadway an shoulder.  The debris in the trailer was placed into a 55 gallon drum for disposal.  The impacted soil was neutralized with soda ash and water and placed in a 55 gallon drum for disposal.       Each battery was then inspected for damage.  If it was damaged the acid was drained into a 55 gallon drum and the battery was wrapped in an acid absorbing packing material.  The damaged and undamaged batteries were separated and repackaged.   The trailer was decontaminated one more time once the load was removed using soda ash and water.  All waste was placed in a 55 gallon drum for disposal.       On June 20, 2014 the waste was taken to PSC Northland Environmental in Province, RI for disposal.  A total of 1 drum of sulfuric acid, 2 drums of soil, acid, soda ash and water were generated.

While proceeding south on Jamestown Road the driver saw a car traveling north and moved his custom applicator rig and nurse tank partially onto the shoulder to more easily allow the car to pass. After the north-bound car passed by, the driver attempted to move his rig and tank back onto the road. The nurse tank then began to weave back and forth until it overturned and skidded along the road and into the ditch. A dirt build-up caused the liquid withdrawal valve to open slightly allowing a release of vapor. The driver called 911 and the facility manager, Tim Richter. The Breese Fire Department and Mr. Richter arrived on-scene. While Mr. Richter contacted IEMA and the NRC, the Fire Department secured the scene. After donning protective gear, the fire department closed the valve which stopped the release. The tank was then righted and the contents emptied into another nurse tank. Those on-scene noted there was no significant environmental or infrastructure damage. In addition, there were no residences or occupied structures nearby. As anhydrous ammonia becomes a gas when released, there was no product to clean-up or dispose of as waste.","In the future all nurse tanks will be transported form one location to another behind company trucks. This combination is narrower which reduced and/or eliminates the need to leave the roadway on many rural roads. In addition, this form of transport will result in greater nurse tank stability. Additional training will also be instituted to reinforce the difficulties and hazards inherent in the transport of anhydrous ammonia nurse tanks.

This scenario adds higher risk factor for cornering maneuvers due to the change of the center of gravity. Brian had previously successfully accomplished this type of delivery in the past.  On this day there was a failure to operate the vehicle in a safe manner.  Eye witnesses described Brian's driving as operating at a speed that was not in excess.  However, with the given knowledge of his loaded trailer and his trained awareness of the road factors, such as road terrain, the speed that Brian went into the turn was indeed a little too much in excess.  The roll-over was described to be in slow motion as it happened. The tractor/trailer ended on it's side.  Two passer-bys called 911 and Apple Valley, MN police arrived within minutes of the accident.  Apple Valley police called the fire department response team.  The owner Steve Steiger was notified.  Steve Steiger contacted the Minnesota Duty Officer and the insurance company, Great West Casualty.  Great West Casualty contacted West Central Environmental Consultants out of Fridley, MN for cleanup.  The front compartment had a pin hole size leak in the compartment that began oozing out gasoline.  The front compartment also had the dome lid slowly leaking product due to the impact of the roll-over.  The dome lid's leak was stopped when given pressure on the dome lid by the owner Steve Steiger.","The driver, Brian Pevito has participated in additional follow up driver training and driver awareness training to identify potential hazards involved with safe driving.  Brian has been put on probation for one year following this incident.  Within this year, Brian will be involved with ride alongs to monitor his driving skills, performance and implemented training.  Steiger Transport Inc. dba/Ratzlaff Transport has recertified Brian Pevito as a hazmat tanker driver.
