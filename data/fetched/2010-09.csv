The car was isolated and the shipper, Evonik Degussa Corporation, was notified via CHEMTREC, # 2010-09-05-00030. HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the release was caused by the breather assembly, continuous vent, device not secured to the rail car. The breather assembly unit and three of the four bolts were found on the working platform. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Stanley McSwain at 251-443-4443. HEPACO personnel re-attached the breather assembly and decontaminated the tank car. The leak was temporarily secured until a qualified repair facility could inspect the car per DOT regulations or the shipper could obtain a FRA Movement approval.     This incident did require a special switching move.   A QA 7.1 Non conformance report will be required.

Rhodia and Shell Chemical Company were notified of the release and each dispatched response teams to asses and remediate the area.  Upon arrival it was determined that the liquid line was leaking from the cap and gasket area. After releasing the built up pressure on the car it was determined that two of the four bolts were tool tight the opposing two bolts were easily loosened when a wrench was applied with minimal force. Cause was determined to be a combination of pressure in the liquid line and insufficient tightening of two of the four bolts.  Oil Mop and two members of the Shell Response Action Team were on scene to secure the car and remediate the area. The gasket appeared to be OK but was replaced and the cap was secured. Excess product in the protective housing and on the sides of the tank car were cleaned off and neutralized with a sodium bicarbonate solution.  Solution was also applied to the product on the ground (less than one gallon) to neutralize the acid.  Area was cleared at 0920 hours.",Shell Chemical Company is conducting an investigation to determine the root cause of the gasket/cap failure and pressure build up in the tank car.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1000,Port Terminal Railroad Association,US,

Eagle/SWS applied a freeze patch to temporarily secure the release until the product could be off-loaded into motor carrier trucks. The shipper was notified to apply for an FRA Movement Approval, as the rail car no longer complies with DOT specifications.      This incident did require a special switching move.

Not knowing if the threads on the valve/body of the tote were in sufficient condition to be tightenened, it was determined that the safest course of action would be to transfer the material into drums.

This created a slosh in the trailer. As the product sloshed in the trailer it pushed the unit into the guardrail. The tractor and trailer rode the guardrail for a little bit and when the guardrail ended the tractor and trailer exited the roadway and rolled over. When it rolled over the dome was damaged and it is estimated that no more than 5 gallons of product was released out of the dome/crash box. The impact of the crash damaged the dome.,"We will review this event with our drivers at our next safety meeting and use this as a learning tool. We will stress the importance of staying alert in a construction zone and keeping off uneven roadway and or soft shoulders. We will also stress the importance of a pre trip inspection and inform everyone how significant it is to make sure that everything is properly fastened. This spill was caused by the crash and not by driver error.

LTCX 1909 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard awaiting inspection by a shipper technician.  The shipper's repair/service technician reported that the 'isolation' valve mounted on 3/4 inch piping in line to the regulating or road valve (pressure relief valve) had vibrated loose via its mounting hardware (bonnet nut) and disconnected from the piping.  The valve disconnection from the piping caused product gas to escape. The technician reassembled the isolation valve with new bonnet gasketing and reattached this valve to the piping and secured it. No liquid product was released in this event. Repairs were completed at 1310 hrs. CDT, 9/18/2010.

BINDER,SAFETY SPECIALIST,7201 Hamilton Boulevard,Allentown,PA,18195,Carrier,"As the driver was initiating the unloading process, he noticed the pump discharge valve (V-7) was frozen up and would not rotate.  The customer operator assisting in the unloading process brought a steam hose and cracked open the steam valve at the utility station while the driver thawed the valve by applying steam to the stem/packing gland area.  After about a minute of applying heat, the valve handle rotated freely by hand, but was left in the closed position as the driver proceeded with the unloading procedure.  After engaging the clutch to start the pump, he began the process of opening the discharge valve while closing the recirulation valve to build pressure.  The pump discharge pressure initially climbed to 140-150 psig which is higher than the 125 psig target, so he turned the discharge valve handle again to ensure it was fully open, as he also began adjusting the VW throttle.  At that point, the V-7 valve blew apart causing LOX to spray into the trailer cabinet.  The driver ran around the side of the trailer and shut down the VW motor.  He then went to ther other side of the trailer to trip the emergency shutoff valve, but when he pulled the t-handle the valve would not trip, so he returned to cabinet to shut off the pump inlet valve.  After closing that valve the LOX flow ceased.  He then opened the manual vent to lower pressure on the trailer.  He secured the trailer for return trip to facility.","Torque procedures for valve bonnet nut have been reviewed and communicated.  We have improved routing for actuation cable and ensured emergency valve operates reliably.  Review emergency response and will incorporate lessons learned into driver training.

A blue mini-van was merging on to Hwy 10 from Jamaica Rd.  This vehicle abruptly cut in to the N&M Transfer driver's lane.  The N&M Transfer driver hit the brakes extremely hard to avoid hitting this blue mini-van.  This hard braking caused a freight shift within the trailer.  The N&M Transfer driver then exited Hwy 10 and proceeded to the 3M location on Innovation Dr., in Cottage Grove, MN.  Just before entering the facility the driver indicated that he then noticed by looking in his side view mirror, that liquids were coming out of his trailer.  The driver went to the 3M guardshack to inform that he had a spill taking place in his trailer.  The 3M emergency response team was notified by the guard.  3M's HM response team performed the entire remediation and decontamination of the trailer.  The cause of the spill was freight (metal stakes on a double-length skid) that was rear-loaded with no secure-ment in front of it.  When the brakes were hit hard the freight slid approximately 20 feet or more and crashed in to the two drums that were punctured.  The two steel drums were hit hard on their bottoms.  They were partially crushed.  Duration of the release was approximately twenty minutes. (An attempt to send photos will be made in a supplemental report).","In this particular incident the freight that slid across the trailer was misloaded by our dock.  The driver was forcedt o work around it for most of his day.  The driver was told to never allow an open gap of floor space on his trailer without some form of blocking and bracing.  In addition, the drums themselves were strapped in place, however, they did not have a barrier in front of them (like a standing pallet) that would have prevented the metal stakes from puncturing these drums.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3300,"NM TRANSFER CO., INC.",US,

The train crew reported that their train inspection revealed a placarded double plug door boxcar NS 469304 was leaking product from around the plug door closure. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder was notified and traveled to the location where the train was stopped. The responder reported that one non-palletized flexible IBC (FIBC, a.k.a. nylon super sack) at the doorway had a hole in the upper portion of the bag (possibly caused by abrasion again the interior boxcar door or punctured by a fork lift tine) which allowed product to escape onto the boxcar floor and seep out from under the gaps at the bottom of the plug door during train movement. The responder plugged the hole in the FIBC with cloth material and also around the larger gaps at the plug door closure. Some spillage at the doorway was dispersed by high winds when the responder opened the plug door. Afterwards, the responder shadowed the eastbound train and reported no further spillage from NS 469304 during resumed train movement. A small amount of spillage that had been wind disbursed against the gage side of the rail and the ballast areas at the train stop location was later collected and placed into a 5 gallon sized container by a BNSF contractor for appropriate disposal.   On 9/21/2010 (approx. 1700 hrs. CDT), after NS 469304 arrived at the BNSF Springfield, MO railyard, it was reported leaking a white powder substance at the doorway of its plug doors. NS 469304 was carefully isolated in the railyard awaiting inspection. BNSF contract responders reported that one FIBC with a hole stuffed with cloth material (the same compromised FIBC previously reported herein from the 9/19/2010 incident) was the leak source of the material that had accumulated on the boxcar floor and seeped out from under the plug door closure.  The responders overpacked the compromised FIBC by placing it into another suitable FIBC. Spillage on the boxcar floor was swept and deposited into the overpack FIBC. Observed spillage around the boxcar's exterior doorway, on the ground and impacted soil (approx. 3 gallons total) was removed and then placed inside the railyard's waste container for later disposal.",No additional comments.,No,IBC,"Textile without coating or liner, for solids",13L1,Yes,,,,,,,68,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2500,BNSF Railway Company,US,

A seperate tank trailer had previously been loaded a few minutes prior. In between the two loads, the discharge valve attached to the top of the tank car was placed in the closed position to prevent any material from filling the hose until the next tank trailer arrived into the loading area. When it arrived and hose connection was being made, the hose plug was removed, yet some material had still entered the hose resulting in approximately 3 gallons of Sulfuric Acid to exit the hose onto the ground. No injuries were reported. Proper clean up was done immediately and later the material was properly disposed of as hazardous waste. It was found that discharge valve was faulty in respect to the handle being in the closed position, yet the internal ball was slightly in the open position to where it was not visible.

GATX 200341 was inspected by BNSF Mechanical/Hazardous Material responders and was safely moved to an isolated area in the railyard for furtherance. Preliminary inspection revealed the leak source was at the valve housing area and product spillage was evaporating with no ground impact. A detailed inspection of GATX 200341 determined that the threaded liquid valve was loose on its threaded connection and its ball valve was partially open with its closure plug not tool tight.  The valve handle was bent in order to properly close the valve housing cover which resulted in the liquid valve not being in the fully closed position. The responders closed the liquid valve and tool tightened the liquid valve on its threaded connection (9 turns). The loose closure plug was removed and Teflon tape applied to its threads, reinserted and tool tightened. The valve housing cover was closed and resealed with BNSF seal numbered 3395758.

There was not supposed to be any liquid material in this box as it had been drained at the facility before leaving, but apparently there was some that worked its way to the surface as the truck went down the road and as the truck stopped for the light it moved forward over the front of the box. Estimated amount of spill varies between 10 and 50 gallons, but entire spill clean-up, including absorbents and all other waste was contained in three, fifty-five gallon drums. All waste was contained, cleaned up and removed by TAS Environmental for disposal. No evidence of any migration or uncontained material, all waste was contained, cleaned up and removed by TAS Environmental for disposal.","Better verification of the contents of the load before pick-up would have indicated the need for a different type of container, due to the liquid sludge content of the material.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Veolia ES Industrial Services,US,

I turned to park and felt the trailer go into a huge pot hole.  The tractor was on the cement.  The trailer was on gravel.  I did not fell anything wrong when Ipulled the trailer out of the pot hole.  I parked for the night.  Normally I would take the dog for a walk and post the trip, but it was rainning so hard that I did not get out of the truck.  At 7:30 am I got out of the truck and found product on the ground.  The rear pipe had been knocked off and the pump was broke off.  The left rear outside tire was flat.  I made all required calls to report the spill.  Fire department and police evacuated the area.  Dyno Nobel were there to clean up.  Missouri DOT did an inspection and okayed all paper work.  OOS to replace pipe and repair the tire.  Returned the rest ofthe product to Barry Illinois and cleaned out the trailer.  I talked to Buddy at the plant who loaded the trailer.  He assured me that all valves were closed. I believe that the bad product that was left on my trailer for four months, by Dyno, damaged my valve.",Dyno Nobel should not leave there bad product on trailer for a long peroid of time.

Apparently, one (1), 21-liter plastic jerrican had been punctured by a nail on the pallet.  Upon discovery, area was isolated and hazmat guide was consulted.  As a precautionary measure only, facility was evacuated for approximately 4.5 hours, from time of discovery, until completion of cleanup.  One (1) employee sought medical attention at local clinic, was treated and released.  Returned to regular duties on 09/22/2010.      Ocean Blue Environmental of Long Beach, CA was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Ocean Blue Environmental applied absorbent material to the free product on the affected warehouse floor, recovered the spent material, and cleaned affected surface to remove residual product.  Ocean Blue Environmental also re-palletized the shipment, which was forwarded on to the consignee.  The cleanup materials, PPE, spent absorbents, and broken down pallet, were placed into one (1), 55-gallon recovery drum.  The damaged container was also placed into an overpack, pending disposition. Disposal will be coordinated in accordance with local, state and federal regulations.

The shipper was notified along with an Environmental Response Contractor who then off-loaded some of the excess material into a highway tank so the rail tanker would quit leaking since the rail tanker was shelf-full.  Since the tank was shelf-full, the pressure built up in the car causing the pressure relief device to release until product was taken off of the car allowing the pressure relief device to reseal.

Movement was stopped and a BNSF Mechanical/Hazardous Material responder immediately inspected UTLX 211876. The responder reported no shipper seal on the manway closure and 4 of 8 manway securement bolts were either not tool tight or not applied. One manway securement swing bolt was not applied (hanging) and three were not tool tight. The responder properly secured and tool tightened the unsecured manway bolts. All spillage on UTLX 211876's side shell evaporated and no ground impact was observed.  Response was concluded by 1000 hrs. PDT, 9/20/2010.    Further investigation into the securement deficiency of UTLX 211876 uncovered the following.   UTLX 211876 was rejected by the consignee (BP West Coast Products, LLC in Seattle, WA) due to the consignee unable to remove the bottom outlet cap (BOC) on the bottom outlet valve (BOV) to unload UTLX 211876 at their facility. BP West Coast Products having limited track space at their facility and other concerns opted to return UTLX 211876 to the shipper's control to repair the stuck BOC. Since UTLX 211876 was not observed leaking product from the manway closure during its inbound movement to the consignee (BP West Coast Products, LLC) and the original shipper's seal at the manway closure was not present, it can be concluded that BP West Coast Products loosened the manway closure to prepare UTLX 211876 for unloading. After attempts to unload UTLX 211876 were unsuccessful, BP West Coast Products failed to properly secure the manway closure when they released UTLX 211876 back into transportation.",Ensure that consignee follows their pre-trip inspection process to ensure all valves and fittings are closed and secure.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

It was determined that approximately 2 gallons of Resin material leaked from the drum, which was caused by fatigue and deterioration of the drum.

The peroxide had already been loaded on the truck and it was at the water station getting the appropriate amount of water for the transfer. After starting the water, the loader left the area and went to the maintenance barn. While in the barn, the loader became involved with activities in the maintenance area and lost track of the time the water was running. As the Foreman was doing verifications and MBWA, he went by the water station to check the water meter, since he did not see anyone at the station. When he got to the station, the truck was overflowing. He immediately shut off the water and removed the hose. He called for a code yellow, radioed the office and immediately began diluting the area with water per Hydrogen Peroxide procedures and the MSDS. It was determined that approximately 13 gallons of Hydrogen Peroxide was released on the asphalt.",Root Causes - Failed to comply with the operational site-specific procedure for transfering Hydrogen Peroxide via dedicated metered pump. The loader failed to follow the procedure which states that the water must be added first in a dilution transfer. Loader failed to monitor the transfer.

We believe that while unloading, our driver, James Smith, discovered a release of LP gas from a flex pipe owned and maintained by Updike's Jerseyville Gas Service, 613 Maple Ave., Jerseyville, IL.  Our preliminary investigation shows that Smith manually closed all valves on the tank he was filling.  This initial release of LP gas caused an explosion.  After the explosion, an employee of Updike's Jerseyville Gas Service, Chuck Updike, reopened one of the closed valves resulting in a further release of LP gas from the flex pipe.  This secondary release of LP gas caused a second explosion.  We are still investigating the duration of the release.                                                                                                                     The package failure is contained within the flex pipe owned and maintained by Updike's Jerseyville Gas Service.  Although investigation continues, the failure resembles a burst or rupture.  No failure has been found within any of Huellinghoff Bros, Inc.'s equipment.  All failure is contained within equipment owned and maintained by Updike's Jerseyville Gas Service.  Further, none of Huellinghoff Bros, Inc.'s employees caused or contributed to the failure.  Huellinghoff Bros., Inc. originally reported this event by telephone on September 13, 2010 at 11:45 pm and was assigned case number 953920.","We are continuing to investigate the exact causes of this incident and future actions needed to prevent recurrence.

A car came up on his left side and entered the spray from his tires.  The car started to lose control and drifted to the right forcing the truck to move to the right to avoid a collision.  The truck drifted too far off the shoulder and drove down the embankment.  The driver attempted to drive the truck back onto the road but over-corrected and the truck and trailer rolled onto its right side, then rolled completely over coming to rest on its left side against an electrical pole.  The driver climbed out of the cab and called 911.  Though the tank suffered multiple dents there was no breach from the shell.  A dome cover had a minor drip which lasted approximately 4 to 5 hours until the Emergency Response Contractor arrived at the scene.  They placed a spill pad under the drip to absorb the product until the tank could be tapped and pumped out.
