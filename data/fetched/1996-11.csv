(BODINE) RECEIVED A TELEPHONE CALL FROM MR. LEE LOURET, OF MANITO TRANSIT, CONCERNING A DIESEL FUEL SPILL.  MR LOURET REPORTED THAT A (MANITO TRANSIT) SEMI TRACTOR TRAILER HAD SLID OFF THE WEST BOUND LANE, OF INTERSTATE 74, 300 FEET EAST OF MILE MARKER 146, DURING AN ICE STORM.  MR. LOURET REPORTED THE DIESEL FUEL RELEASE OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 6:30 AM. APPROXIMATELY 1300 GALLONS OF FUEL HAD RELEASED INTO A DITCH, LOCATED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE WESTBOUND LANE. AT APPROXIMATELY 9:05 A.M., BODINE DISPATCHED A SENIOR PROJECT MGR AND TWO LABORERS TO THE SITE TO DETERMINE THE VISUAL EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION, INITIAL CLEAN UP OBJECTIVES, AND TYPE OF EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE DIESEL FUEL CLEANUP.  UPON ARRIVAL THE PROJECT MGR PROCEEDED TO MEASURE THE SPILL AREA, AND PHOTOGRAPH THE AREA FOR THE ""BEFORE"" PICTURES FOR THE PROJECT FILE.  THE CONTAMINATED AREA WAS APPROXIMATELY 225 FEET LONG BY 8 TO 15 FEET WIDE.  THE PROJECT MGR DETERMINED A VACUUM TRUCK WOULD BE NEEDED TO REMOVE APX 5500 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL REMAINING FROM THE DAMAGED TANKER, AND 1300 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL FROM THE DITCH. ************* FOLLOWING THE SITE INSPECTION BODINE PERSONNEL PROCEEDED WITH THE INITIAL CLEANUP OF THE SPILL.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF DIESEL FUEL WAS REMOVED FROM THE DITCH WITH ABSORBENT PADS, AND PLACED IN 6-MIL POLY DISPOSAL BAGS.  PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS DEBRIS WERE ALSO PLACED IN THE BAGS.  AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30 AM, BODINE'S VACUUM TRUCK ARRIVED AND BEGAN TO REMOVE THE REMAINING DIESEL FUEL FROM THE WRECKED TRAILER.  THE PRODUCT WAS VACUUMED INTO BODINE'S VACUUM TRUCK AND TRANSFERRED INTO A (STANDBY) MANITO TANKER.  BODINE PERSONNEL PROCEEDED TO VACUUM THE REMAINING 1300 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL FROM THE DITCH.  THE DIESEL FUEL VACUUMED FROM THE DITCH WAS TRANSPORTED TO BEAVER OIL IN HODGKINS, IL. BODINE TRANSPORTED THE DIESEL FUEL UNDER IL MANIFEST #IL 3677278.  A COPY OF THE MANIFEST IS ATTACHED IN APPENDIX D. **************** FOLLOWING INITIAL CLEANUP, A COST ESTIMATE WAS CALCULATED BY BODINE BASED ON OBSERVATIONS FROM THE SITE VISIT AND SIMILAR CLEANUPS. IT APPEARED THAT APPX 8-10 SEMI-DUMP TRUCKS OF CONTAMINATED SOIL WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE DISPOSED OF AT A SPECIAL WASTE LANDFILL.  IN ADDITION, 8-10 LOADS OF FILL DIRT WOULD BE NEEDED TO RESTORE THE SITE.  THE BODINE PROJECT MGR CONTACTED THE CLINTON LANDFILL LOCATED SOUTHWEST OF THE PROJECT SITE IN CLINTON, IL.  A VERBAL REQUEST WAS INITIATED FOR THE LANDFILL TO APPLY TO THE EPA'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE UNIT (ERU) FOR AN EMERGENCY DISPOSAL PERMIT TO BE AUTHORIZED FOR THIS SITE. THE APPROVAL FOR THE  EMERGENCY PERMIT AND ASSOCIATED AUTHORIZATION NUMBER WAS RECEIVED ON NOV. 18, 1996.  A COPY OF THE EMERGENCY SPILL RESPONSE REPORT IS ATTACHED IN APPENDIX C.

THE CAR WAS SET TO THE CABOOSE TRACK AND ISOLATED PENDING INSPECTION.  TANK CAR GATX 22859 WAS RECEIVED ON INTERCHANGE FROM THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD AT COLTON, CA, 0024 HRS, TUESDAY, 11/26/96, AND ARRIVED IN YERMO ON THE CNYR-25, 0600 HRS.  MGR COOPER DROVE TO THE YERMO YARD FACILITY AND DEVELOPED THAT THE CAR HAD ACTUALLY BEEN FOUND LEAKING AT 0120 HRS, WED, 11/27/96, WHILE BEING SWITCHED.  DURING THE SWITCHING OPERATION, TWO MEMBERS OF THE GROUND CREW HAD BEEN SPLASHED WITH THE PRODUCT.  BOTH SWITCHMENT IMMEDIATELY WASHED THE PRODUCT OFF AND CONTINUED ON WITH THEIR WORK, COMPLETING THEIR SHIFTS. THE SUPV, YARD OPERATIONS, HAD CALLED AND LEFT A MESSAGE ON MGR COOPER'S VOICE MAIL, AND DID NOT MAKE ANY FURTHER ATTEMPT TO CONTACT MGR COOPER. ********** MGR COOPER, IN COMPANY WITH ROBERT SPINKS, SPECIAL AGENT HAZ MAT, INSPECTED THE CAR AND FOUND THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE FROM THE CONTINUOUS BREATHER VENT.  THE VENT ASSEMBLY IS AN OLDER 4 PIECE ASSEMBLY WITH AN INSPECTION CAP; RETAINER COVER; BOWEL OR BASE PIECE; AND A 12 INCH FLANGE, WHICH MOUNTS DIRECTLY OVER THE 3 INCH DIAMETER RISER TUBE FROM THE CAR.  THE BOWEL ASSEMBLY BOLTS WERE LOOSE AND THERE WAS A 1/4 INCH VOID BETWEEN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWEL AND THE FLANGE.  IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE BOLTS FOR THE BOWEL ASSEMBLY, WHICH WERE MOUNTED INTERNALLY, THE FLANGE HAD TO BE REMOVED.  IN THE PROCESS OF REMOVING THE EIGHT 5/8 INCH FLANGE BOLTS, ONE BOLT WAS BROKEN OFF IN THE LOWER FLANGE.  THIS WILL HAVE TO BE DRILLED OUT AND REPLACED ONCE THE CAR IS SHOPPED FOR REPAIRS, AS THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS WERE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE FIELD TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK. ******************* ONCE THE FLANGE WAS REMOVED THE 4 INTERNAL ALLEN BOLTS WERE TIGHTENED TO SECURE THE BOWEL TO THE FLANGE.  THE BREATHER VENT WAS REASSEMBLED AND THE REMAINING VALVES AND FITTINGS WERE ALSO INSPECTED, WHICH WERE FOUND TO BE PROPERLY SECURED.  THE CAR WAS MOVED SEVERAL TIMES TO INSURE PROPER SECUREMENT AND THEN RELEASED FOR MOVEMENT ONTO THE CONSIGNEE.

THE AMOUNT OF CHLORINE, WHICH COULD NOT BE ABSORBED BY THE EVACUATION LINE SCRUBBER, WAS EMITTED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. THE RAILCAR WAS VENTED TO THE SCRUBBER FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE VARIOUS CHEMICAL REACTIONS WHICH OCCURED IN THE SYSTEM, THE RELEASE DURATION FROM THE SCRUBBER TANK AND SCRUBBER BUILDING LASTED MOER THAT 50 MINUTES. TWO BOWATER EMPLOYEES WERE SENT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR OBSERVATION.  THE EMPLOYEES WERE RELEASED THE SAME DAY. BOWATER EMPLOYEES ACTED PROMPTLY TO SHUT OFF THE UNLOADING RAILCAR.  ALSO, A VALVE ON THE EVACUATION LINE WAS AUTOMATICALLY THROTTLED BACK BY THE SYSTEM.  THE THROTTLED VALVE REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF CHLORINE CHARGED TO THE SCRUBBER AND THUS REDUCED THE RELEASE. THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL OF FUTURE EPISODES OF THIS NATURE: 1.  THE VALVE WHICH WAS INADVERTENTLY PLACED IN FRONT OF THE HIGH PRESSURE INTERLOCK SWITCH HAS BEEN REMOVED.  THIS WILL ALLOW THE SWITCK TO PROPERLY SHUT THE RAILCAR OFF WHEN HIGH PRESSURE IS DETECTED IN THE EVACUATION HEADER; 2.  A THREE-WAY VALVE WAS REPLACED WITH A SPOOL PIECE, AND THE CIRCULATING TANK LEVEL HAS BEEN RAISED TO 85%.  THESE ACTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN A HIGHER HEAD PRESSURE FROM THE PUMPS; 3.  THE HOLES IN THE EVACUATION HEADER AND THE FAILED RUPTURE DISC HAVE BEEN REPAIRED/REPLACED.  PIPING REPLACEMENT ON OTHER AREA OF THE SYSTEMS ARE UNDERWAY.
