ARRIVING UNITS FOUND A 10,000 GALLON POLY TANK THAT HAD BEEN ON THE FLATBED SEMI TRAILER HAD STRUCK THE BRIDGE OVERPASS AND ROLLED DOWN THE INTERSTATE APPROX. 150 YARDS AND CAME TO REST IN THE DITCH SOUTH OF I-80. THE TANK WAS LABELED AS RADIOACTIVE AND APPEARED TO BE INTACT. DC2 REQUESTED THE RESPONSE OF #902 AND #906. THEY RESPONDED AND ARRIVED AT 1845. DC2 NOTIFIED IHP AND DOT AT 1857 FOR TRAFFIC CONTROL. 906 NOTIFIED DNR AT 1900 TO MAKE A PRELIMINARY REPORT. PER DNR, REP. FROM STATE DEPT. OF HEALTH WOULD BE ENROUTE FROM DES MOINES TO MONITOR FOR POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION WITH A ETA OF 0030. A CALL WAS MADE TO THE CONSIGNEE, DUANE ARNOLD ENERGY CENTER IN PALO, IA. WHO DISPATCHED TERRY WILKERSON TO THE SCENE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE SHIPPING PAPERS WERE OBTAINED FROM THE DRIVER AND INDICATED THE TANKS WERE EMPTY, BUT CONTAMINATED WITH LSA RADIOACTIVITY. 902 AND 906 PERFORMED RAD MONITORING FROM THE COMMAND POST TO THE TANK IN THE DITCH AND DETECTED A MAX OF 75/M ON THE SURFACE OF THE TANK WITH NO SIGNIFICANT CONTAMINATION WITHIN A 5' RADIUS OF THE TANK. THE CONSIGNNE MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A CRANE TO RE-LOAD THE TANK ONTO THE TRAILER. IHP AND DOT CONTROLLED TRAFFIC WHILE THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED AT APPROX. 2230 HOURS. THE TRUCK WAS ESCORTED BY IHP TO TRISM TRANSPORT AT 900 W. 76TH ST. DAVENPORT. AT APPROX. 0030, GEORGE JOHNS, AN ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST FROM IA. DEPT. OF PUBLIC HEALTH ARRIVED FROM DES MOINES AND WAS ESCORTED TO THE SCENE BY 906 AND 902. JOHNS CHECKED THE SCENE FOR POSSIBLE RESIDUAL RADIOACTIVITY FROM THE OVERPASS TO THE TANKS' LOCATION AND DETECTED NO SIGNIFICANT CONTAMINATION. THIS CONFIRMED THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY 906 AND 902 WITH CDV INSTRAMENTS. A MR. DON BROOKSTRA FROM ILLINOIS-IOWA CLAIM SERVICE ARRIVED EARLY INTO THE INCIDENT TO REPRESENT THE INTEREST OF THE TRUCKING COMPANY, TRI-STATE MOTOR TRANSIT. ACCORDING TO THE ESCORT DRIVER, THE TRUCK DRIVER WAS WARNED OF THE OVERPASS HEIGHT VIA RADIO, BUT WAS UNABLE TO STOP IN TIME TO AVOID THE COLLISION. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE TRIP FROM THE INCIDENT SCENE TO TRISM TOOK APPROX. 1.5 HOURS DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE HEIGHT OF THE TANKS AND THE NECESSITY TO PASS UNDER TWO MORE OVERPASSES ENROUTE. THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THE LOAD CLEAR THE OVERPASSES WAS TO SHORTEN THE VEHICLE HEIGHT BY REMOVING THE AIR FROM THE TRANSPORT VEHICLE'S AIR RIDE SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWED CLEARANCE UNDER THE OVERPASSES BY APPROX. TWO INCHES. AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AT TRISM, THE REPS. FROM IDPH MONITORED THE TANKS FOR RAD LEAKAGE AND FOUND MODERATE LEVELS OF RADIOACTIVITY AT THE TANK SURFACES BUT NO LIQUID LEAKAGE. THIS CONFIRMED THAT WHILE THE TANK SUFFERED PHYSICAL DAMAGE, THE INTEGRITY REMAINED INTACT. INTERESTED PARTIES WERE OFFERED PICTURES TAKEN BY THE HAZMAT TEAM OF THE INCIDENT.
