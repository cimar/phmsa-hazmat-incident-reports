UPON INSPECTION OF THE CONTENTS (OUTER PACKAGING WAS A BOX), THERE WAS NO DOT CYLINDER OR AEROSOL INSIDE ALTHOUGH THE SHIPMENT WAS SENT AS A FLAMMABLE GAS. THEY HAD CHECKED THE INNER CONTENTS AT MY REQUEST TO SEE IF THERE WAS A VALVE ON A CYLINDER THAT COULD  BE CLOSED. SINCE THIS WAS DECLARED BY THE SHIPPER AS A GAS, WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT SECURING THIS IN THE STANDARD SALVAGE DRUM DUE TO BUILDUP OF PRESSURE ON THE LID. IT WAS PLACED OUTSIDE AND A THE SHIPPER WAS CONTAINED TO PICK UP THE FREIGHT. THERE WERE THREE OTHER PACKAGES THAT DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE AN ODOR AT FIRST. I ASKED THE EMPLOYEE TO OPEN ONE AND TELL ME WHAT WAS INSIDE. THE BOX HAD A STRONG ODOR ONCE THEY OPENED IT. INSIDE APPEARED TO BE A PART, AN AIRPLANE FUEL BLADDER WRAPPED IN PLASTIC AND SECURED BY TAPE. THERE APPEARED TO BE SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE SHIPMENT. THE ODOR SEEMED TO THE EMPLOYEE TO BE MORE RELATED TO FUEL SO I SUSPECTED A CLASSIFICATION ERROR WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FLAMMABLE LIQUID. ALSO WHEN THE STATION PERSONNEL CALLED THE SHIPPERS EMERGENCY RESPONSE NUMBER THEY GOT AN ANSWERING MACHINE. THIS WAS BETWEEN 4:30 AND 5:00 P.M. I CALLED AGAIN AFTER RECEIVING THE STATION FAX OF THE SHIPPER'S DANGEROUS GOODS PAPERWORK, AND WHEN I CALLED (800_359-7264 I GOT A MESSAGE TELLING ME THAT I HAD REACHED 1-800 FLY CHEAP AND IT HAD MESSAGES ABOUT PRESSING ONE NUMBER FOR CRUISE INFORMATION, ANOTHER FOR FLIGHT INFORMATION ETC. I THOUGHT I HAD REACHED THE WRONG COMPANY. THEN AGAIN, AFTER 5:00 WE CALLED THE SHIPPER'S MAIN BUSINESS # AGAIN THIS TIME REACHING AN EMPLOYEE. WHEN I QUESTIONED HER ABOUT THE PHONE #'S SHE SAID ALL THEIR NUMBERS WERE ANSWERED BY HER BEFORE 5:00 UNLESS SHE WAS AWAY FROM HER DESK AND THEN THEY ROLL TO AN ANSWERING MACHINE. SHE SAID AT 5:00 SHE FORWARDS THEIR MAIN 800 # (SAME # AS THE ER # THEY GAVE) AND IT ROLLS TO THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE #. SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE FLY CHEAP MESSAGE BUT SAID THAT # IS STEVENS.
