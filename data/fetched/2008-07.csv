The operator discontinued the attempt and rejected the trailer.  The trailer was transported to the motor carrier terminal and at the tank wash the cap was removed and a minimal amount of product was captured. It was determined at that time that because the trailer was bottom loaded maybe the operator at the shipping point failed to drain the material properly from the outlet leg prior to shipment leaving the line full.  The trailer was rescheduled for shipment and delivery was made.  Trailer was cleaned and tested and it was determined that the internal valve needed a new gasket. After repair a vacuume test on both the internal and external valves and passed.,Norminally during bottom loading the wet lines are draine of residual product. The internal vale was teasted and showed to be leaking by but the external valve was not. The question at this time still remaines as to how the material got to the dust cap. It is possible that after loading the line was not drained and material became traped between the external valve seat and the dust cap.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Enterprise Transportation Company,US,

Prior to being accepted for processing, the shipment was staged at the facility’s in-transit storage area.  While pending receipt, facility personnel observed a small amount of liquid dripping from the rear door of a van trailer.  Emergency Response personnel entered the trailer using appropriate personal protective equipment and determined that a polyethylene IBC developed a small leak from the body of the container that allowed approximately 3 gallons of material to leak onto the floor of the van trailer.  The crew immediately contained the release and moved the compromised container to the facility’s waste management area where the contents of the container were removed and processed.  The response crew then absorbed all free liquids with a suitable absorbent material and containerized the clean-up debris in a suitable container.  This material was placed into storage pending disposal at a licensed waste management facility.","At the time of loading, the driver inspected the container and did not observe any evidence of leakage or damage to the container.  The individuals that responded to the release did indicate that it is suspected that the leak developed during transport and was suspected to be caused by either age or degradation of the container over time.  In order to prevent a recurrence, the shipper has been advised as to the suspected cause of the release and has been asked to insure that all containers are thoroughly inspected prior to being offered for transportation.

The drum was immediately up righted and the crew responsible for the transfer immediately donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and contained the spill on the concrete dock with an absorbent material.

UTLX 202788 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard awaiting a detailed inspection. A BNSF contract responder inspected UTLX 202788 finding the liquid eduction valve not fully closed and product seeping out from around the liquid line's threaded plug. The responder closed the valve (approximately 1/4 turn) using a wrench. The liquid line plug was checked and it was tightened slightly to fully tool tight. Apparently, internal pressure build-up inside UTLX 202788 forced product to seep out from the threaded plug area. All other fittings were checked and deemed secure. Response was concluded by 1900 hrs. CDT 7/02/08 after UTLX 202788 was monitored and no further product release was evident. Product spillage on the tank shell evaporated.  A small product stain under UTLX 202788 was treated with Micro-Blaze.

No additional product spillage was evident when PROX 42161 remained motionless. A BNSF mechanical responder immediately inspected PROX 42161 and reported tool tightening four of the eight manway securement bolts. Afterwards, a shipper responder arrived and inspected PROX 42161 finding all valves and fittings secure. PROX 42161 was then moved in the railyard under close observation by the responders. During this movement, a small amount of product was observed emanating from the manway area and movement was stopped. The shipper responder then inspected the manway nozzle gasket. The gasket appeared to be in good condition and undamaged. The responder proceeded to replace this gasket, installing a new gasket and resecured the manway cover. PROX 42161 was again moved in the railyard under responder observation and this time no product release was observed. PROX 42161 was released to proceed to its destination. All spillage evaporated.

The driver was instructed by the fracturing company (Frac Source) to unload the product into a Frac Source transport (capacity 5,400 gal). The Skyline Chemical,lnc. driver was told by Frac Source personnel monitoring the unloading that there was about 1,000 gallons in the transport. The Skyline Chemical driver prepared his trailer for unloading and upon completion notified Frac Source personnel (on site)that the unloading would requireassistance monitoring fluid levels in the receiving tank. Frac Source personnel on location stated they did not have safety equipment available to assist the unloading. So the driver decided he would monitor both tanks while unloading the hcl. The unloading went well until the delivery tank was empty. These particular hcl trailers unload by pressuring the tank to move the liquid from one trailer to next. When the delivering trailers product was unloaded, the pressure it took to transfer it followed. This caused the pressure(10-12 psi) to transfer to the receiving tank. The tank level in the receiving tank (Frac Source) was approximately 3” from being full to capacity. The pressure in the delivery tank caused the fluid in the receiver’s tank to overflow on to location. The spill was quickly neutralized with sodium bicarbonate (soda ashe) by Frac Source and Skyline Chemical personnel.",Receiver should always provide assistance to help monitor fluid levels.

The Olin Chlorep Team responded to Niagara Yard and found SBLX 14170 to be properly sealed. Upon seal removal, the A-End liquid line and closure plug were less than tool tight.

Material spilled into a catch bucket that was placed under the valve. A small amount of material hit the containment pad. Driver closed the internal valve a drained the material into the bucket. The trailer was taken to the carriers terminal and it was determined that the envelope gasket at the quick connect was bad. The gasket was changed out and the material was delivered.,A closer inspection of this gasket by the driver may have prevented this incident but not 100% sure because the shop person had to take it out to descover the problem. The envelope gasket had deteriated over time and had cracked at the fold allowing material to seep through.

The responder found PLMX 135299 (DOT 112J340W tank car) as the odor source and then directed it to be isolated in the railyard. Afterwards, the responder reported that PLMX 135299's 280.5 psi pressure relief device (PRD) was emanating a slight product vapor hiss. No liquid spillage was evident. BNSF contract responders arriving from Forth Worth, TX also inspected PLMX 135299 concluding that the PRD was emitting a product odor. The internal pressure of PLMX 135299 was 125 psi and gauged with 16.5 inches of product outage. The responders removed the PRD o-ring cap/retainer and found the seat o-ring (inner o-ring) was partially split or cut, possibly from over compression. A replacement o-ring cap/retainer with new o-rings was installed and secured. Leak detection fluid was used to ensure no further vapor release was present around the PRD. PLMX 135299 was monitored and reinspected at 0715 hrs. CDT, 7/16/08. Internal pressure was holding at 125 psi and no further product odor or vapor release was detectable. PLMX 135299 was released to proceed to its destination.

The responder reported finding PROX 34814 (DOT 112J340W tank car) as the odor source. Seal AGR 078253 was removed from the valve housing cover. The responder then found the liquid valve partially open (1/2 turn to close) and its closure plug not fully tool tight (3/4 turn to close). The responder closed the liquid valve and tool tightened its closure plug. PROX 34814's internal pressure was at 160 psi. The responder also noticed some rust developing inside the valve housing area which is indicative of exposure to a mix of ammonia with moisture. This tank car was new and on its first loaded trip in transportation. The response was concluded by 0635 hrs. CDT, 7/26/08 when no further product odor was evident after the securement was completed.

As JRSX 1009 was awaiting the application of correct placarding, a BNSF carman observed periodic product drips emanating from its bottom outlet valve (BOV). A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder was notified and inspected JRSX 1009. The responder reported that all of the BOV mounting flange bolts on a relatively new BOV mounting flange were less than tool tight (from 3/4 turn to 3 turns loose). The responder tool tightened the four BOV mounting flange bolts and wiped the flange area clean. Afterwards, no further product drips or seepage was evident and the response was concluded by 1230 hrs.

During this storage time, facility personnel noticed a small amount of material leaking from the rear of the trailer onto parking area.  Facility personnel activated the facility's emergency response team who donned the appropriate PPE, entered the trailer, and identified a 55 gallon non-bulk package containing individual containers of paint and paint related materials had built pressure that caused the lid to become displaced from the container.  The container in question was placed into a suitable salvage drum and the inside of the trailer and adjoining drums were cleaned with a suitable cleaning compound.  IN addition, a small amount of contaminated solid that was contaminated when the material leaked from the rear of the van trailer was containerized and disposed at the facility.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, the containers were inspected and no visual indicators were observed that would indicate the drum was developing or had developed pressure.  A review of the containers after the incident did not clearly identify a cause of the pressure build-up though it is suspected that one of the inner packages developed pressure caused by the ambient temperature and the agitation of the shipment during transportation.  This, we suspect allowed the accumulation of vapors in the head space of the drum that eventually displaced the lid.

Upon doing her pre-trip, she noticed a drip coming from underneath the trailer near the front.  She put a bucket under it.  We weren't sure whether or not rainwater had gotten into the insulation or if it was product.  Considering this was a poison, we erred on the side of safety and transferred the product to another trailer.  We had an emergency response crew stand by in case of any incidents.  The transfer was completed successfully. (note:  the UN# on the BOL is UN3426.  This program would not recognize that number. I had to enter UN2074 which is acrylamide solid to continue processing this report.  This product is acrylamide solution, UN3426.)",The cargo tank was brought into the shop and inspected.  It was found that the front washout cap had a damaged neck and did not seal properly.  This allowed product to seap out around the barrel and through the skin.

The driver lost control of the tanker wchich overturned onto the guardrail which ripped the seams of the tank allowing the fuel to leak when the truck & tank came to rest on the passenger side in the center of the highway. The fuel leaked out for approximately 3 hours. First responders & in house clean up personel made a dam below the culvert to contain product reaching Smoot Creek.

EMS including EMA Deputy Director Richard Cooper. Marion Environmental was called to clean up. They arrived at 8:30 am and completed clean up by 12:30 pm.  Investigation found that the relief valve on back of tanker #1639 had popped off from pressure in the tanker. Vent valves are kept open on tankers until the driver is ready to leave the plant. What the driver didn't notice as he left was that the auto valve on top of the tanker had closed. This valve supplies air when open.

At 0900 as he made his turn one of the drums containing 30x1 gallon jugs tipped over. Driver saw smoke coming out from his flatbed and pulled over and saw a small amount of acid had leaked out on his flatbed. Driver notified the plant and immediately a response team was dispatched. Upon arrival we noticed that the Manatee County Fire Department was already on the scene and in the process of cleaning up the spill. Officer in charge of the Fire Department was Bob Tollise. Mr. Tollise stated that no report would be written up by the Fire Department. No bottles came out of the drum and no caps were off the bottles. It was determined that about one half gallon of acid had leaked out of a combination of 3 loose gallon jug caps.,DRIVER HAS BEEN RE-TRAINED ON HIS PRE-TRIP INSPECTION FOR SECURING HIS LOAD.,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Allied Universal Corp,US,

They determined that the 5 gallon pails of material were damaged due to improper loading.  The pails were loaded on pallets and one pallet was placed on top of another, so that there were two layers.  The contractor stated that the weight must have been too great for the pails on the bottom, which caused them to crack and release material.  The material was contained in the back of the trailer and did not impacted the environmental or asphalt parking surface in any way.  The contractor removed the pallets from the trailer and sorted through them to determine which ones had been damaged.  The damaged pails were placed in a roll off box and transported for disposal.  The contractor then used granular absorbents to remove the material from the trailer floor.

DCLX 3057 was isolated at a Tidewater industrial track.  Three BNSF employees (crew members whom reported this odor) were taken to a local hospital for evaluation and examination for chemical vapor exposure. All three were examined and released, although two of these crew members had x-rays taken that resulted in negative findings and medical prescriptions provided. Two of the three crew members incurred lost work days afterwards.  BNSF contract responders were called to provide air monitoring support, product decontamination and inspection of DCLX 3057. Responders found all external valves and fittings secure. A small amount of dampness was found at the base of the A-end liquid valve and it was wiped dry. Also, a dried stain that originated near the valve housing area and ran down the side of the tank shell at center tank was cleaned. Afterwards, DCLX 3057 was carefully moved a very short distance to its unloading location at the Tidewater facility. Once DCLX 3057 was unloaded, the contract responders pressured-up the tank to 7-8 psi and this pressure held for over two hours. No root cause for the product vapor odor could be readily determined.   SA-080802 received to transport residue DCLX 3057 to a specialized cleaning facility.  In late September, 2008 the railcar cleaning facility's preliminary testing at 30 psi indicated that the A-end liquid valve leaked through the ball. This valve is scheduled for tear-down for root cause analysis at a later date at a qualified tank car repair facility.  The last tank qualification for DCLX 3057 was accomplished in the year of 2005.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,Pressure,105JW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

High Street; Suite 200,POTTSTOWN,PA,19464,Other-Contracted Transfer Faci,"On Thursday July 24, 2008 at approximately 4:15 PM EDT, Savage’s Transfer Operator - Bryheem Berry setup and was conducting a Solvay HFS tank car to tank trailer preload transfer.  The transfer originated from Solvay tank car ACFX 77590 and was expected to transfer 40,000 LBS/4,000 GALS into Quality Carriers acid tank trailer #50119.  The Solvay tank car ACFX 77590, and QC trailer # 50119 were spotted and staged approximately in the middle of the terminal’s transfer track # 8 and corresponding asphalt aisle way.    Mr. Berry setup the transfer on the tank car side by applying the liquid product valve assembly fitting, applying air fitting/adapter, connecting compressed air hose and liquid product transfer hose.  Mr. Berry then proceeded to setup the trailer side by inserting the discharge end of the transfer hose into the trailer’s open dome and secured it by wrapping a bungee cord around the hose and tying it down by the dome lid housing.  Mr. Berry then proceeded to set the depth indicator on the depth stick by utilizing the trailer’s outage chart and order quantity.  Upon completion of the setup process, Mr. Berry proceeded to commence the transfer by opening the tank car’s product primary and secondary liquid valves and pressurizing the tank car with compressed air.  Mr. Berry then viewed the product flowing into the trailer, and did not see any abnormalities, nor did he observe evidence of leakage and/or any other issues with either the hose connections and/or containers (tank car; tank trailer).    At approximately 4:45 PM, the QC trailer # 50119 contained 39,100 LBS/3,910 GALS HFS when the bungee cord which previously secured the discharge end of the transfer hose came undone from the trailer’s dome lid housing and the transfer hose dislodged from the inside the trailer.  Mr. Berry who was on the ground level at the time, immediately ascended the tank car’s ladder and shutoff the car’s product primary and secondary liquid valves.      Approximately 50 gallons of Solvay HFS were released from the transfer hose; the spillage predominantly accumulated onto the underlying asphalt pavement, and minute amounts seeped into the adjacent ballast area, as well as accumulated within the corresponding tank cars' track pan.  No injuries were sustained from this incident.  Onsite personnel responded promptly to the incident scene, they contained/diked the spillage, protected the integrity of the storm drain system and neutralized the spill with sodium bicarbonate/soda ash.  The soda ash HFS mixture then was shoveled up, along with the affected ballast areas and drummed.  Prompt notifications were made to TRANSFLO’s Mgt, CSXT Philly Eastside personnel (Tim McBride), CSX Police, National Response Center (Report # 878379), PADEP and the City of Philadelphia.    By 6:00 PM, Savage personnel wrapped up response and clean up activities.  React Environmental (Emergency Response/Environmental Contractor) is expected this week (8/4 - 8/8) to complete the corresp","Corrective Action(s)  The below items have been identified as the corresponding corrective actions which shall be implemented in order to prevent this incident from reoccurring.     1) Utilize on all future HFS transfer a 2” loading tube on the trailer side that that can be inserted into the trailer’s open dome way and secured by the dome lid’s ears.  The 10 micron drawstring filter sock shall also be applied to the loading tube’s discharge spout and secured with a band clamp.  This transfer method enhancement was implemented on 7/25/2008.    2) Savage’s Regional Management shall survey the other Savage operated TRANSFLO terminals to inquire whether there are any splash tank car to tank truck transfers or vise versa which utilize bungee cords to secure a transfer hose that is inserted down either inside a trailer’s open dome and/or tank car’s open manway.  The survey results shall be evaluated upon a case by case basis with the intent to make potential enhancements (e.g., progressing towards a hard connection/loading tube) depending upon the transfer method and gauging of product/outage.
