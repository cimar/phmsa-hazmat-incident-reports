IHB Transportation advised car number MTZX 330369 appeared to be leaking vapors from the protective housing. It was first reported as a strong odor of natural gas by the IHB Car Dept. The tank car was a load of UN3295 Hydrocarbons, Liquid N.O.S. Hazard Class 3 flammable liquid, packing group 1. Tracks BSY9, 8, 7 were all shut down the the Blue Island South Yard.     Upon arrival myself and hazmat contractor Response Management Services (RMS) inspected the car and found that the liquid valve in the protective housing was not fully shut. There was audible and visual evidence of the leak. You could hear the pressure coming out of the plug and also see bubbling on the threads of the plug. There was also a small amount of product dripping out of the plug. After tightening the valve with a wrench and removing the plug and cleaning it and applying new tape the leak was stopped. It is unclear how much product was lost in transportation to the IHB. The car came from Aux Sable Liquid Products in Morris, IL and was headed to Savage Services in Hammond, IN.",,No,TANK CAR,,112J340W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad,US,

Facility personnel responded to the spill by building a gravel berm around the affected area. The spilled material was recovered. An affected area of gravel service road exiting the scale was excavated to an approximate depth of six (6) inches. The recovered material and excavated gravel were transported to the active working face of the landfill, off loaded, and buried following the facility’s receiving and unloading procedures.  The concrete was pressure washed and the liquids recovered; approximately 85-gallons. The recovered liquid was placed in the facility’s leachate collection tank which is managed as a 90-day generator tank for F039 leachate.",The incident investigation determined the cause as human error by the driver. The driver failed to fully tighten the tailgate turnbuckles.  The truck crossed the speedbump exiting the facility’s scale causing the tailgate to jar open.

BNSF Hazmat member inspected the car and found the top operated bottom outlet valve to be partially open (1/4 turn) contributing to the release.  The valve was closed and the leak subsided.  While inspecting the BOV nozzle, the shipper had a 3""-2"" bushing, a nipple and a 2"" valve with a plug.  The leak through the open TOBOV was leaking past the threads on the 2"" nipple above the valve.  Responders drained the remaining liquid in the nozzle, removed the 2"" nipple (with valve assembly) which was cross-threaded/mis-alinged and installed the 2"" plug in the bushing to seal the bottom of the car.  The removed parts were secured in the valve housing for the shipper/consignee to use for closer inspection.  The potassium hydroxide that had leaked from the car and impacted the nozzle was neutralized and cleaned.","Shipper should ensure that all fittings and components on the tank car are secured prior to offering for transportation.  This includes inspection and closing of the TOBOV valve and securement of the packing nut.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Odfjell Terminals, was notified via CHEMTREC Report #2017-1114-00200.  Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that 4 of the 6 manway cover swing bolts were less than tool tight.  Additionally, MEI found that the secondary securement plug on the sample line valve was not installed.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative Cheryl Kennedy (713-844-2312).  Contractor personnel opened the manway, inspected the manway gasket, and properly secured all manway cover bolts. The leak was secured and the car released for transport.

Facility personnel donned the correct personal protective equipment and cleaned the impacted area with absorbents and spill pads. This waste material was disposed of in the appropriate branch waste stream. The tanker was offloaded without further incident.

When driver took off the dust cap on the external some product came out. This is not his fault. the external and internal valves were closed.   2. When he hooked up his hoses and began unloading a small spill came from the hoses where they were attached to the external. The gaskets were fine and not the issue. He had to put a shim on both sides and it worked then.  3. Before he put the shims on he needed to disconnect the hoses. In doing so he had another spill because he had to do a wet brake. This is his fault as he forgot to use his IM fitting on the external when hooking up his hoses. When he went to disconnect he didn’t have any way to bleed out the product and had to unhook while they were loaded. He took the blame for this and understands that he needed to use it.   4. In total maybe about 5 gallons spilled out between the 3 spills. The customer took care of the clean up per the driver.,The driver was coached on proper unloading procedures. We also advised him to bring with him a special piece of equipment that allows him to bleed the lines when working with our Intermodal trailers.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

According to the caller, terminal personnel punctured (1) 330-gallon poly tote of product. Approximately 100-gallons of product has been released to the dock and parking lot. The caller indicated that the majority of the release is inside on the dock floor. Terminal personnel have placed down absorbent materials at this time.Contractor estimates that approximately 150 gallons of product has been lost. The parking lot has an impacted area of 30' x 80' and the dock floor has an impacted area of 20' x 20'. Contractor will utilize vinegar/water mixture to neutralize the area. Contractor indicated that approximately 100-gallons of product was released to the parking area and approximately 50-gallons to the dock floor. Contractor is using neutralizing and absorbent materials to clean the release at this time.The contractor reports the cleanup operations are going well on site. The team is currently transferring the remaining product from the damaged tote into a new, clean tote. However, the contractor has advised this product cannot be fully cleaned and neutralized with vinegar/water and absorbents. The impact to the parking lot is extensive. This area will need to be pressure washed to fully clean the parking lot. The team has advised a vacuum truck will be needed to collect the impacted waste water. Contractor reports they were advised that the asphalt parking was very recently paved. Therefore, pressure washing operations could damage the new asphalt. Therefore, the contractor is continuing to neutralize and clean the impacted area with absorbents. In order to fully clean and neutralize this product, additional time on site will be required. The team has generated (4) drums of absorbent waste at this time. Contractor has departed the site at this time and advised all waste has been containerized into 9-55 gallon poly open top drums and 1-275 gallon poly tote containing an estimated 120 gallons of product. Contractor has staged the waste on site pending disposal. A stain remains on the parking area due to the spilled product.

The driver of the Dupre tractor-trailer braked to avoid an accident causing the load in the trailer to shift forward. The trailer was hauling (10) - 330 gal poly IBC's and (3) 330 gallon poly totes containing UN1779 Formic Acid were shifted forward and went through the front of the trailer striking the cab. (1) of the totes fell over and made the entire trailer unstable. Approximately 1 gallon of Formic Acid released onto a small area of asphalt roadway from a leaking cap on one tote. There was no impact to any soils, drains or waterways. The driver of the tractor-trailer was transported to the hospital as a precaution but there was no exposure. All 7 lanes of I-10 WB were shut down from the hazmat release.   On November 28, 2017 at 1000 EST, the local fire department and Masters ARS (Hazmat contractors) arrived onsite for cleanup operations. They confirmed less than 1 gallon of UN1779 Formic Acid released onto a 6 ft x 1 ft area of concrete roadway from a leaking tote cap. (3) 330 gallon poly totes were shifted from the accident and needed to be transferred before the trailer was moved. All product from the damaged totes was transferred into (20) - 55 gallon poly drums for salvage product and placed on a relief trailer. The spilled material was neutralized with soda ash and solidified with absorbents for waste.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the transfer operation, it was discovered that approximately 2 gallons of material had  escaped from a pinhole leak that had developed in the container. Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised  container into a suitable salvage drum. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and  placed into the salvage drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.","At the time of pick up, the drum was wrapped in plastic and secured with duct tape.  As the plastic was removed, the driver noted missing bungs and a small amount of duct tape around the top area of the drum.  The bungs were replaced and the drum loaded into the transport vehicle.  The drum was fine during transport and sat at the facility warehouse over the weekend.  As the drum was being offloaded for palletizing, it was noted approximately 2 gallons escaped from a small crack near the top of the drum.  It is determined that the remaining duct tape covered a small crack near the top seam of the drum.    Additional container management training will be conducted with all branch personnel to prevent this type of incident from recurring.

Driver and plant personnel contained the material and cleaned the area.   The external valve was found to be inoperable. The dust cap was re-installed and the material returned to the shipper. The cargo tank trailer was cleaned and taken to a cargo tank repair facility. The seat on the external valve was found to be damaged. It appears the carter pin which secures the seat nut in place was missing and allowed the seat nut to back off allowing the seat to detach from the external valve stem thus making the device in-operable.
