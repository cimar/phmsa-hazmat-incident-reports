RESIDUAL NITRIC ACID ( LIQUID) WAS FOUND IN THE SAFETY VALVE PORT, ON THE MANWAY NOZZLE COVER AND FITTINGS ATTACHED TO IT. RUNOFF WAS NOTED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TANK. IT WAS REPORTED TO HAVE REACHED THE GROUND. RUNOFF REACHING THE GROUND AHD BEE N NEUTRALIZED BY THE BALLAST THERE. ALL FITTINGS IN THE TOP PROTECTIVE HOUS ING WERE CORRECTLY GASKETED AND TIGHTLY SECURED. THE CAR WAS DETERMINED TO BE CORRECTLY LOADED WITH SUFFICIENT OUTAGE FOR EXPAMSION. THERE WAS NO PHYS ICAL EVIDENCE OF OVERSPEED IMPACT FROM HUMPING. THIS WAS DETERMINED BY EXAM INATION FO THE CAR, PARTICULARLY IT'S COUPLERS AND DRAFTGEAR. THE ADJACENT CAR, SOUPLED TO, WAS ALSO EXAMINED. THE TENTATIVE CAUSE FOR THE RELEASE IS BELIEVED TO BE A DEFECTIVE CONDITION OF THE 7516 TEST SAFETY VALVE.
