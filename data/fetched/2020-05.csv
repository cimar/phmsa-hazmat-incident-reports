Yard crews immediately placed absorbent pads under the car and notified Railroad HazMat Response Officer (HazMat).  Upon arrival of HazMat, car was still venting, pressure reading on the car was 90-psi. A Haz-Hammock was set up in addition to the absorbents for product containment.  A vacuum truck was mobilized to the site and a 2"" chemical transfer hose was attached from the cam fitting on the manway and run to the vacuum truck.  The vacuum truck was opened, but no vacuum applied, the tank car valve was opened and the pressure differential moved the product to the vacuum truck.  This relived the pressure on the car and with the removal of pressure and product the car stopped venting thru the PRD.  This process was continued until the product was below the manway opening in the car (visually checked thru the cam valve on the manway).  Once product was below the manway, the manway was opened and outage taken showing that the car was shell full.  Stenciling on the car indicated that 10.5"" = 4% tank outage.  A clean stinger was utilized and removed an estimated 1,437-gallons of product to allow proper outage in the car. The BOV was still dripping after relieving the pressure on the car and believed that the pressure had pushed product into the ball valve.  The valve was cycled twice, the plug removed, cleaned and replaced the plug which stopped the leak. The car pressures were checked in the remaining cars of the tank train with all within normal limits.  GATX18644 was sealed and cleared for continued shipment to destination. Estimated 5-gallons released to containment.","Upon additional investigation at a latter date, it was determined that the cars in the Tank-Train were not equalized.

While attempting to offload, it was discovered that one drum of chromic acid tank bottoms was not properly secured and had tipped onto its side. When the driver attempted to reposition the drum, the lid loosened. Approximately 5-7 gallons of hazardous material leaked out of the package onto the truck floor and deck plate. The truck was positioned within the sump area and all hazardous material was captured. There was no release of hazardous material to the environment.    Envirite operational personnel immediately contained the spill, cleaned the sump, and containerized the rinse waters in a 300-gallon tote. Five drums were placed in overpack containment due to being covered in waste. All containers were labeled, characterized, and will be properly disposed of at Envirite.     The packages failed in transportation due to the following factors:   -The generator did not utilize a package that was rated for liquids.    -The drum was not adequately secured while in transportation.","Transporter is reinforcing proper container selection with the generator.

The release was initially estimated at one (1) gallon to the trailer floor. R+L retained Cura Emergency Services, LC(CES) to manage the cleanup. CES dispatched a crew from Environmental Hazmat Services(EHS) to initiate corrective actions. Crew members removed the damaged 55-gallon drum from the pallet and placed into an overpack drum to then be transported to the Aroura, CO terminal as the driver requested. Absorbent pads were then utilized to collect any free material that had not evaporated.

Driver immediately shut-off pump and upon further investigation, it was discovered that the customer miscalculated the amount of product in their tank prior to the start of transfer resulting in approximately 50 gallon spill into and outside of containment area. While customer was cleaning up spill, driver was unhooking transfer lines from CMV pump and product splashed onto his chemical gloves, front of shirt and front of paints. Driver went immediately to on-site safety showing, rinsed & changed clothing. Product did not make direct contact with driver's skin, therefore, first-aid/treatment was not needed.    Due to driver being a Texas based employee, Carrier policy required driver to be sent for Post Incident testing and evaluation. Driver was sent to On-Site Medical-Gonzales, LA. on 5-13-20 and during evaluation, driver indicated that he may have inhaled some of the chemical. On-Site completed evaluation and required the driver to return for a follow-up on 5-14-20. Driver returned on 5-14-20 as scheduled and was cleared by On-Site to return to full-duty.",Driver verbally counselled by Carrier Safety Dept. personnel concerning proper hose handling per Carrier policy and procedure.   Shipper conducted fact finding investigation via webinar with Customer and Carrier on 5-15-20.

The waybill lists the unit as carrying hazardous material. In the interest of safety, the unit was placed on hold and moved to the containment pit pending interior inspection.  Premium Environmental was contacted and Patriot Environmental Services was dispatched to remediate the load. Interior inspection revealed palletized stretched wrapped boxes paint stowed 2 high and 2 wide with no doorway securement. The leaking substance was deemed as hazardous by Patriot. The origin of the leak was boxes on the bottom of a bottom pallet.

The unit was completely on its side, laying on side of the interstate in a shallow ditch. There was a small leak of product dripping from the vapor release valve on top of the trailer. This was due to the weight of the product pushing against the valve. The entire unit has damage to the entire right side. It is too early to tell if the barrel of the trailer was damaged. It had been raining so the interstate as well as the shoulder was soaked with rainwater. There were no evacuations ordered and know exposures reported. The state closed the east bound side of the interstate until the wreckage was completely cleared.","Highway Transport requires our drivers to stop in a safe location every three hours for what we title as a “Tire Check.” This was implemented so that our drivers can ensure everything is okay with the units and the load; leaks, placards, tires not over heating/flat, lights working and for the driver to get a little exercise by walking around the entire unit.

Railroad personnel viewed liquid product being released from the pressure relief device (PRD), placed absorbent pads under the car and made notification to Railroad Hazardous Materials (Hazmat) Officer.  Hazmat responded with outside contractors to the site. Initial pressure on the car was 80-psi.  Upon arrival of a vacuum truck, a chemical hose was attached to the cam fitting on the manway lid, run to the vacuum truck and the vacuum truck valve opened.  The manway valve was opened and the pressure differential pushed the product to the vacuum truck.  This stopped the release from the PRD.  Once the product level was below the manway (viewed thru the valve) the manway was opened and outage obtained.  Stenciling on the car indicates that 10.5"" = 4% outage in the tank.  The car was shell full and an estimated 1,437-gallons of product was removed from the tank car to allow proper outage for shipment.  Due to the fact that car was in a Tank-Train and this was the second NAR from this string of cars, all of the cars in the string were opened and outages checked before releasing the cars for movement.","Upon investigation, it was noted that the first two cars in the Tank-Car string were shell full, cars 3 & 4 were slightly over the outage limit, cars 5 & 6 had proper outage and car 7, the last car had 45"" of outage.  It was concluded that the cars were not allowed to properly equalize prior to closing the connecting valves in the Tank-Train.  Shippers should verify proper outages on each car prior to shipment.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CANADIAN PACIFIC RAIL SYSTEM INC,US,

Approximately 1 pint of material leaked from the container. Upon inspection it was identified that there was a small puncture at the top,  side of drum (about three inches from the top of the drum).   There are two causes to the release that occurred. 1) The drum appears to have had some  corrosion caused by the material within the drum. The drum showed signs of rust from within the  drum after the puncture occurred. 2) The drum was also punctured by a metal ""s"" hook that was in the truck's e-track load securement system. The ""s"" hook pierced the drum when it was loaded into the back of the vehicle. The Veolia employee did not see the protruding ""s"" hook when he loaded  the drum into the truck.  Veolia, Tonawanda, NY employees donned the appropriate PPE, overpacked the leaking container  and cleaned up the spill.","Veolia, Tonawanda, NY employees had a meeting with the Veolia EH&S manager about assuring no  sharp objects were within any vehicles. Veolia employees need to be aware of potential sources of  drum punctures when loading containers into the truck and remove them. All employees will be  retrained on checking vehicles for potential sharp objects. The customer (offeror) was notified of the  spill and the integrity issue of the drum.

Documents contained the IAC, air waybill and invoice.  After Agent Gabby Rosales processed security paperwork, the driver presented shipment for dock acceptance.    During dock acceptance Noberto Duque discovered a clear envelope sleeve containing a Shippers Declaration.  Noberto immediately flagged the shipment and brought it to the attention of Supervisor Kelly Covarrubias.  The shipment had a Shipper’s Declaration but no hazard labels or statement on the air waybill indicating the same.  As a Category 6 trained person Kelly recognized the mismatch of Shipper’s Declaration to labels.  Kelly also recognized that that an air waybill description of “aircraft parts” could indicate the presence of a hidden dangerous good as outlined in IATA DGR 2.2.  With aim of preventing undeclared dangerous goods from being transported and given the high visibility for this AOG must-ride shipment on the booking list we attempted to discern if this was indeed a dangerous good.    We enlisted CAP018 to obtain a contact for this air waybill and contacted Terri who is listed as point of contact in the remarks section, multiple calls resulted in voicemail.  We dialed the listed number on the top right of CAP018 and were unable to reach a contact.  We then found, in an email thread, a contact for the Schenker AOG desk that is monitored on a 24/7 basis (866-890-1235) and spoke to Diane.  We explained the shipment arrived with a Shippers Declaration but lacked hazard labels.  Diane confirmed it was not a dangerous good and granted permission to remove the declaration.  Shipment was then loaded and manifested on QF0940/30May 2020.","A read and sign will be issued to all staff to advise when suspicion arises that a shipment may contain dangerous goods the shipment will be placed on hold (regardless of commodity or booking level).  Qantas customer service will obtain written confirmation from the ultimate shipper, not the Forwarder.  The Forwarder will then confirm by endorsement of the air waybill that no part of the content is dangerous (e.g. “Not-Restricted”).",Yes,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,0,"WORLDWIDE FLIGHT SERVICES, INC.",US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, National Response Center, and West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2020-0527-00343). Specialized Professional Services, Inc., a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found 2 of 4 liquid line flange to fittings plate securement bolts less than tool tight, resulting in a Non-Accident Release. Additionally, the liquid line valve into the threaded connection was easily spun, and the vapor line valve into its threaded connection was easily spun. The vapor line valve secondary closure plug was also less than tool tight. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Mr. Kendrick Bowen, phone 214-577-1046. Contractor personnel secured all loose service equipment and cleaned all impacted surfaces. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

(LTI) driver was operating a straight truck tanker. Driver was headed east bound on St Rt 350 enroute to Clarksville, OH loaded with approximately 1,108 gallons of dyed diesel, 900 gallons of clear diesel, and 650 gallons of unleaded gasoline. The driver had never been on that road prior to that day. He was covering for another driver in the Lebanon, OH area. Therefore, the driver was not familiar with the route and was using GPS which took the driver on St Rt 350 headed to Clarksville, OH from Monroe, OH. Parts of St Rt 350 in that area are steep and curvy. The driver should have not been on that section of the state route and was going too fast for the road. At approximately 0815 the driver was approaching a sharp downhill curve and failed to control the tanker which resulted in a rollover striking a tree and went into a ravine with a creek bottom adjacent to the road. The driver was able to climb out of the truck cab. The tanker suffered compartmental/piping damage which resulted in a spill. Approximately 350 gallons of diesel was released into the creek which is a tributary to the Little Miami River. Most of the product was contained to the tributary. Some of the release did enter the Little Miami River, but the amount is unknown. No gasoline was released only diesel.  Multiple first responders and hazardous material cleanup crews responded to the scene. Initially, the spill was mitigated with the use of oil absorbent booms and pads. And, a large boom was placed in the Little Miami River at the base of the creek. Also, on May 27th several thousand gallons of water was flushed down the creek and captured to recovery the bulk of the diesel in the creek. Over the next few weeks spill absorbent booms and pads were maintained throughout the tributary along with the large boom in the river. As rainfall events occurred, diesel was absorbed, and supplies were replaced as needed. As of today, the clean up still under way as the site and it is waiting for a few more good rainfall events to capture any remaining diesel that is still left behind. The site is monitored during and after rainfall events. The cleanup will be completed in the next few weeks depending on the weather.","Lykins Transportation, Inc. (LTI) reviews all incidents, in order, to determine the root cause, preventability, and what actions, i.e. training or procedures, need to be conducted or implemented so that the incident will not happen again. The rollover was caused by the driver being unfamiliar with the area and going to fast for the condition of the roadway. LTI conducts multiple driver focused safety meetings during the year. LTI will brief all drivers about the incident and its preventability. LTI will focus on the importance of communicating to drivers where impassable routes are located and best practices when covering unknown areas.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,103875,LYKINS TRANSPORTATION INC,US,

(LTI) reviews all incidents, in order, to determine the root cause, preventability, and what actions, i.e. training or procedures, need to be conducted or implemented so that the incident will not happen again. The rollover was caused by the driver being unfamiliar with the area and going to fast for the condition of the roadway. LTI conducts multiple driver focused safety meetings during the year.

While traveling, driver struck a vehicle in front of him, lost control and veered into the center median of the Highway. As a result, the trailer was damaged and caused cargo to shift. The Local Fire Department, Grant County EMA, Wisconsin DOT, and Tegeler Wrecker responded to assess the site. Tegeler Wrecker assisted in recovery efforts, applied absorbent material to the affected roadway and cleared debris from the road. Enviromark was dispatched to perform the cleanup. Upon arrival on site, two 330-gallon totes were discovered damaged. Enviromark pumped approximately 40 gallons of free product from within the totes, and estimated 620 gallons had released to the asphalt roadway and grassy soil within the median. Once Tegeler cleared the road, tote was offloaded and site secured, Enviromark marked the area of impact within the median.

The driver pulled the truck over to the side of the road and a bystander called 911.  The Danville Fire Department (DFD) arrived on scene and quickly extinguished the fire.   The water used to extinguish the fire contacted the material in the truck.  Some of the water was absorbed into the material and the majority of the remaining water was captured into the spill containment that the fire department placed at the tail gate of the dump truck.  A small amount made its way on to the ground around the truck.  The fire department successfully used clay absorbent and pigs to create a dike to prevent the water from entering any ravines or waterways.  The incident occurred near the intersection of US 36 and Clear Creek Drive in Danville, Indiana.","As the party that shipped the material, Heritage Environmental Services plans to monitor the temperature of materials that contain the wastestreams that were involved in the fire for a period of time before they are loaded to ensure excessive heat is not being generated prior to shipment.

On Wednesday , May 27th, 2020, Globe Petroleum had a company driver look at the on-site tank gauge located on the tank to determine what amount of product Diesel Fuel was in the tank was misread , the actual amount that was in the tank was greater than originally reported . On Thursday , May 28th, the dispatch office at Globe Petroleum , Inc. authorized the delivery driver to load 7,000 gallons of on road ULSD fuel based on incorrect information . Upon arrival at the customers location Shore Point Distributors with the on road ULSD Fuel, The deliver driver did not reconfirm the amount of on road ULSD Fuel in the tank before he started the transfer of product from his tanker to the onsite  10,000 gallon tank . Due to this oversite , a release of ULSD Fuel from the overfill on the tank occurred. An estimate of fuel released was approximately between 40-60 Gallons of ULSD Fuel. Some of the released fuel was captured in the tanks containment unit and the balance was released on the ground surrounding the tank. The delivery driver immediately began containment procedures to mitigate the spread of the release. After he contained the spill, he informed the Dispatch office at Globe Petroleum, Inc. of what happened, and a spill response team was dispatched to the scene. In total it took six (6) bags of oil absorbent ""Speedy Dry"" to remediate the released ULSD Fuel on the ground surrounding the tank and the remaining released fuel in the containment area is being scheduled for removal by LORCO Inc. via a Vac -Truck.","Upon a complete investigation into the events leading up to and including remediation of the above release, Globe Pertoleum, Inc. has determined that even though incorrect information was communicated, Ultimately it is the responsibility of the delivery driver to confirm how much product is in a tank before the process of fuel transfer begins.
