During a routine yard check, it was noticed that a small amount of liquid was leaking from the trailer.  A response crew was summoned, donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and entered the trailer.  A drum was found to have a small leak in the side near the bottom.  The drum was overpacked into a suitable salvage container along with the absorbent material used to clean up the spill on the trailer floor and the pavement.  The shipment was then loaded onto a trailer destined for the intended waste disposal facility.  The incident was called in to Ohio EPA, incident number 1204-31-0807.",The leak appeared to have been caused by a small piece of metal protruding from the side and floor of the trailer.

The Linden Bulk Transportation Co., Inc. vehicle was involved in a vehicle accident, which resulted in a rollover on I-78.  As a result, the tractor trailer unit straddled the center median of I-78, tractor landing on the westbound side, with the trailer in the eastbound lanes.  I-78 eastbound was closed as a result of the accident.  A valve on the cargo tank was damaged, causing a leak from an air-line, which released approximately 20 gallons of aluminum sulfate to the asphalt roadway. New Jersey DOT, Union County HAZMAT, and the Local FD responded to assess the site.  Local responders applied speedy dry to the affected asphalt roadway, and contained the release, pending cleanup and offload of damaged tanker.  Atlantic Response, Inc. of East Brunswick, NJ was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  The damaged tanker was offloaded, uprighted, and recovered from the site.  Additionally, there were approximately 5 gallons of diesel fuel that released from the tractor.  This was also contained to the asphalt roadway.  Atlantic Response, Inc. recovered all spent speedy dry from the affected roadway, and surface-scraped the contaminated roadside soils.  There was no impact or threat to state waters.  Seven (7), 55-gallon drums of spent speedy dry, and one (1), 55-gallon drum of contaminated soils were generated during response efforts.  There were no injuries or exposures as a result of the accident.","Linden Bulk Transportation Co., Inc. will continue to train and reinforce safe handling procedures and driver safety to all personnel.

The car was isolated in track C1 of the rail yard away from CSXT employees and the shipper, Heritage Crystal Clean LLC, of Indianapolis, IN was notified via CHEMTREC report # 2012-04-07-00055. SWS Environmental Services, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene with a CSXT Hazardous Material Manager and found the bottom outlet valve was defective and the leak could not be stopped. Contractor personnel tightened the bottom outlet cap and reduced the leak to a trickle and deployed a haz-hammock. The issue identified was relayed to the shipper's  representative. The shipper provided 4 highway tank trucks to receive the transferred  product from the tank car. SWS Environmental also cleaned and purged the rail car of all residual product. The shipper will  request a OTMA to forward the car to a shop for repairs.     This incident did require a special switch move.

Packages containing formalin (formaldehyde)were found to have loose lids; material spilled onto the cargo, damaging it.  No release outside of the trailer.  In discussion with shipper, the likely cause of the failure was heat; cargo not adequately protected from desert climate, resulting in a buildup of internal pressure that loosened the closure device (a screwtop lid).  The majority of the material from failed packaged had evaporated prior to arrival of hazmat team.   Residue and contaminated materials were disposed of as hazardous waste.",Securement was sound; the failure point was in the packaging.

Driver of CMTV was able to exit the CMTV and get the spill kit out of the truck to contain the spill.  Police and emergency responders were called in.  Company employees were also sent with additional spill kits and supplies to help contain the spill until ESP of Vermont arrived on the scene for clean up and remediation of spill.","Accident could not have been prevented from any effort from company due to the nature of the accident.  Driver did all he could to right the truck before losing control -it was noted by witnesses that other vehicle made no effort to stop.  Crack in tank was out of reach (over the bridge) so spill materials could not reach the area that fuel was being released from.  Driver, employees and emergency personnel did all they could to contain the spill until the spill clean-up team arrived.  Our company was commended on how well we contained the spill by Emergency Personnel.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,344350,FLYNN ENERGY TRANSPORT INC.,US,

This valve and pipe are inside of the tank containment area.  The Barge began unloading and some of the Caustic Soda entered this open 2"" water addition valve/hose connection and spilled into the containment area.  Estimated flow time out of the 2"" connection is one hour and five minutes.  When discovered the barge unloading was terminated and the 2"" valve was closed.  The Terminal Supervisor contacted the Operations Manager.  The In-House Response Team responded gathered to begin the clean up process.  The Incident Commander/Operations Manager called the Minnesota Duty Officer and 911 to report the spill.  The spilled Caustic Soda was pumped into tanker trucks.  The cement containment area was cleaned and rinsed.",A Pipe/Valve Walkdown/Checklist will be added to the procedures to be completed by the Terminal Operator prior to unloading barges.  This will ensure that all valves are positioned as needed to prevent future spills.

When the employee moved the pallet, one pail fell over and the lid popped off causing the release of approximately 1.5 gallons of mineral oil. The pail was immediately uprighted and the lid was placed back onto the pail. The spilled oil was cleaned up and using bentonite absorbent and placed into another container.","Investigation of the containers post incident revealed that the pails were shipped with a secondary market lid called a gamma lid.

Driver put on PPE to determine where leak was coming from. Noticed the drip between axles from flange area, tanker leaked a drip for approx 2 hours then stopped due to a vacuum created inside the tank. Sand was brought in to create a berm. Alamo 1, responded for Haz-mat team/cleanup but did not have the proper equipment for the job. SWS was called at 23:00. at 21:00 Tiger paws' second tanker arrived for the transload. SWS arrived at 01:52. Transfer began at 04:00, minutes after the pump failed. The trailer started leaking again but was contained in a containment pool and pumped back into the tanker. Transfer resumed at 06:45 with a pump provided by San Antonio Fire Department.. Lime was used to neutralize the spill and the ground would be scheduled for excavation as soon as possible. SWS decontaminated trailer with spill pads and lime for repair. Trailer was repaired by Tiger Paws mechanic to fix brakes, air lines etc for safe transport back to Houston. Upon examination of tanker after wash out, the liner appears to have failed causing the acid to seep around the flange at the sump area therefore causing corrosion around the flange, see pictures.","Tiger Paw Transport leased the tanker trailer that failed.

The employee immediately washed off impacted area and required no pursuing medical attention.  Investigation by BNSF operating and mechanical/hazardous material responder revealed that an unloading pipe coupling/adapter was still attached to the top liquid eduction line pipe stanchion which would not allow the liquid line closure cap to be applied. The customer was in the process of removing this pipe coupling/adapter prior to the BNSF crew moving GATX 5842. Movement of GATX 5842 likely caused hydraulic surge of acid material in eduction piping to splash out through this open orifice.

Driver attempted to decelerate just before and through the curve.  As the transport proceeded through the curve, the driver could not maintain his lane and encroached onto the unimproved shoulder of CR22.  As the trucks right side steer and drive axles entered the unimproved shoulder, the driver attempted to bring the truck back onto the paved road.  This caused the trailer to continue forward progress and subsequently overturn the transport.       Due to the rollover, the vent in the top of the CTMV leaked approximately 150 gallons of product onto the unimproved shoulder. Product was allowed to escape due to a damaged rubber vent line sleve.     OHP secured the scene and the Laverne Fire Department diked around the truck to prevent runoff.  Company personnel responded to the scene as well as an Environmental Clean-up contractor. Product in the rolled over CTMV was transferred into other CTMV's.  The rolled over CTMV was then uprighted via wrecker services.     The Environmental clean up contractor excavated the contaminated soil at the scene on 4/24/2012 and replaced with clean fill. The contamined soil was removed from the scene and appropriately disposed.","The root cause of this accident was ""Driving too fast for type of roadway"", and the driver's failure to react appropriately to the leaving the roadway. Additional training is warranted.  All company drivers will participate in an accident review process to include the imporance of speed managment, and how to appropriately respond to the truck leaving the roadway.",Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,208850,"BKEP Crude, LLC",US,

Soon after transfer started, the motor carrier driver noticed the product leaking from the unloading connection. He stopped the product flow and called over one of the senior employees at the TRANSFLO terminal to report the release. Spill pans and tarps were placed under the leaking connection to contain product. Once the product had stopped leaking the transload employee broke the connection and found that the gasket was intact, but noticed it had become unseated (misaligned) in the connection. Half of the gasket was hanging loose in the hose. This gasket has just been replaced a few days earlier. This was starting the 5th load on these gaskets and the gasket appeared to have been warped from the heat. The gasket was replaced and the driver tried to continue the transfer, but the product had solidified in the hose which required removal and replacement of the transfer hose. Approximately 1 gallon of Molten Sulfur was released onto the asphalt. It was all contained and cleaned up once it solidified. No product entered the facility drains or went off-site.",1) Damaged hose and gaskets were replaced with gaskets rated for higher temperatures.  2) A clean out valve was purchased to clear product hose if transfer is stopped again before transfer is complete.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Kinder Morgan Materials Services,US,

Mr. Yost spoke to Mr. Rony Robinson of the Amarillo Fire Department. It was reported that a shop mechanic had some of the liquid from the trailer get on his gloves and when he was power washing one of his gloves caught on fire creating a quick flash fire that burned his hand. The Fire Department responded and then made entry into the trailer and identified a pallet which contained multiple containers of Paint Related Material (acetone) which had one 5-gallon pail which appeared to have been leaking.    The pallet was located approximately 10 feet up into the trailer. Mr. Robinson stated that the spill was contained and there was no risk of an additional release. He agreed to leave the back doors of the trailer open so it would air out while EMI was enroute. The Fire Department then demobilized from the site.    The EMI team arrived on site at 2:00P.M.  EMI entered the trailer using Level C ppe and checked the air quality inside the trailer. It appeared that most of the acetone had evaporated and respiratory protection was no longer needed. They found one 5-gallon pail of Platinum Refinish Gun Wash on the bottom row of the pallet which had a crease that had split open on the side of the pail ncar the top of the pail. This damage was on the side of the pail that was facing outward and could not have been caused by anything on the load. The only assumption was the pail had to have been damaged during or prior to loading. Only 1-2 quarts of material could have been released from this crease. Their was also a hole in the side of the pail near the bottom that had been caused by it rubbing up against the adjacent pail. This hole was on the side of the pail which was facing towards the inside of the pallet. The boards on the pallet were fairly thin and were spread out so there was 3-4 inches of space between each of the boards. The pails sitting on the pallet were able to lean and shift back and forth during transit causing a rubbing action which wore a hole in the bottom of the pail. Several of the other pails had similar marks on them where the paint had been rubbed off of them.    The pails were removed from the saturated pallet and all were wiped clean of the acetone residue. They were then placed back onto a new pallet. A layer of all absorbent pad was place on top of the new pallet and a layer of cardbord was placed between each row of pails. Each row was secured tightly with cord and then with shrink wrap so they could not vibrate or wiggle side to side. The complete pallet was then shrink wrapped together so it was could not shift. The plywood separators were placed back inbetween the cargo and all of the pallets restacked back into the trailer prior to it being released.    Mr. Daniel Garcia, the truck service general manager, requested an MSD sheet of the released product to be sent to him and provided a fax number. He was requesting the MSD sheet since his employee had some of the material get on his hand. Mr.Yost obtained the MSD",The pails on the pallet were improperly secured to the pallet and themselves allowing them to move and rub against each other. Also the container was either damaged during loading or prior to loading the trailer.    The hole in the bottom of the pail could have been prevented by proper packaging prior to transport.,No,INSIDE CONTAIN,"Plastic container, no capacity or description given",CONT PLS,No,,,,,,,36,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7090,CONWAY TRUCKLOAD,US,

BRULIA,DIRECTOR OF SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE,25800 SCIENCE PARK DRIVE,CLEVELAND,OH,44122,Carrier,"The  Austin vehicle (a truck tractor in combination with a van semi-trailer) was eastbound on Interstate 20 in the right fane. Traffic ahead of the Austin vehicle slowed, apparently  due to a small right-of-way fire on the westbound side being attended to by public fire services.  Responding to the slowed traffic, the Austin driver slowed, turned on his ememency flashers and cued in behind the vehicle to his immediate  front following slowly at safe distance.  In his rearvlew mirror, the Austin driver observed a vehicle approaching from behind.  Although the emergency flashers were on, the Austin driver immediately pumped  his service brakes to further signal the on-coming  driver.  Seconds later, the on-coming vehicle, a commercial motor vehicle, collided at an angle into the rear left corner of the Austin semi-trailer. The Austin driver was in his safety seatbelt at the time of impact, and he did not sustain any injury.    Fire service personnel were on the scene very quickly.  Police arrived shortly thereafter. Fire services freed the other driver from his vehicle.  He was subsequently  treated and removed from the accident scene by EMS. The Austin power unit did not sustain damage, but its semi-trailer was disabled by the collision.    With fire services  immediately  on the scene and law enforcement  summoned, the Austin driver called CHEMTREC and his home terminal for assistance to transload all cargo from his disabled semi-trailer to another Austin tractt:wtsemi-trailer.  The Austin disabled trailer's cargo was checked by the Austin driver, and no damage was  observed. All cargo within the disabled semi-trailer was safely transloaded  to the other Austin semi-trailer by trained  Austin personnel.","AIthough, this accident  appears on Austin's most recent MCMIS, it is clearly ""non-preventable"" based on the definition of a preventable"" in 49 CFR 385. 3.  However. in an abundance  of caution, Austin requested an independent accident  reconstruction specialist to investigate the accident. He concluded  that the Austin driver could not have taken any countermeasure that could have averted this accident.    The driver of the other commercial motor vehicle was cited by law enforcement, but the Austin driver was not.  The company  that owned and operated the other commercial motor vehicle has agreed to reimburse  Austin for all reasonable costs and damages related to the accident.",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,329,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,14912,ERTS,US,

As the tank and trailer rolled over, the cage protecting the preSsure relief valve was crushed and the pressure relief valve broke off the tank, allowing the contents of the tank to be released. After the tank rolled over, the driver towing the tank called 911. The 911dispatch notified police and fire departments who responded immediately. Precautions were taken to ensure the safety of persons in the vicinity. Ms. Alison Manz of the IDNR and Ron Tvinnereim of Gavilon arrived at the site on April 12, 2012 and contacted Iowa One Call upon direction of IDNR. Ms. Manz indicated  that soil would need to be excavated and took samples of water from the ditch. Gavilon personnel pumped water from the ditch and applied the water on an adjacent field, as recommended by Ms. Manz (with landowner consent). Gavilon personnel created a small berm to prevent impacted storm water from reaching a nearby culvert. A hazardous material response contractor arrived on site in the afternoon of the 12th and excavated soil as recommended/directed by Ms. Manz and worked on the 12th, 13th and 14th to excavate impacted soil. The soil was placed on plastic and covered with plastic. Once the ground was dry enough, the hazardous material response contractor applied the impacted soil on an adjacent field (with land owner consent). The contractor backfilled with excavated area with clay and black dirt, planted grass seed and placed erosion matting over the area (upon direction of IDNR and county).",Inspect Trailer Tongues,No,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,101700,GAVILON AG SERVICES LLC,US,
