The truck overturned on its top in the borrow ditch and the trailer turned on its side. The incident occurred approximately one mile west from the top of Rodgers Pass in Lewis and Clark county, MT. The product truck and trailer was loaded with 9,052 gallons of #2 low sulfur diesel fuel. Two small leaks were discovered in the product delivery truck fuel storage compartment. The leaks were plugged by MRC responders using a combination of wooden stakes and beeswax. Approximately 191 gallons of diesel fuel leaked from the product truck before it was plugged. MRC responded immediately to the incident by dispatching the Company's oil spill response team, five towing trucks, two empty fuel trucks, and two vacuum trucks. The response consisted of two task forces. Task force one was instructed to recover the product from the truck and trailer and then remove the equipment from the site. Task force two was instructed to contain and recover all spilled diesel fuel. Task Force one recovered 9301 gallons of diesel fuel from the truck and trailer and returned the product to the Great Falls refinery that evening. The truck and trailer were recovered and towed to repair shops in Missoula later in the day. Task Force two deployed 50 feet of containment boom and 30 feet of absorbent spaghetti below the incident area. All of the spilled diesel fuel was trapped above the sand dike placed by the Highway Department to prevent migration of the product down the borrow ditch. (Figure I). MRC responders used vacuum trucks to recover the water and fuel trapped behind the impoundment. Small pockets of product were cleaned up using absorbent blankets. The spent absorbent, water and product were taken to the refinery for recovery and disposal. The entire incident was declared over at 3:45 p.m. on 12/18/98. Approximately 191 gallons of diesel fuel spilled onto the ground. (Table 1). Most of the product was recovered using vacuum trucks and absorbent blankets. MRC anticipates a few gallons (probably <5 gallons) was trapped under ice or entrained in the snow.

ACCORDING TO INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE DRIVER (OHIO TRAFFIC WITNESS STATEMENT ATTACHED),  THE BRAKES FAILED AS THE DRIVER APPROACHED THE WEIGH SCALE LOCATED NEAR MILE POST #175.  IN A EFFORT TO AVOID HITTING OTHER VEHICLES THE DRIVER DROVE INTO THE DITCH TEARING OUT 5 FENCE POSTS, PROCEEDING TO HIT BRIDGE ABUTMENT AND ROLLING OVER A LEAST ONCE.  THE VEHICLE HAS SEVERAL COMPARTMENTS WHERE THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS WERE BEING STORED DURING SHIPMENT. FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES PLEASE REFER TO THE DRAWING.  WHEN THE TRUCK ROLLED OVER A SMALL QUANTITY (ESTIMATES 1200-1400 LBS) OF AMMONIUM NITRATE-FUEL OIL MIXTURE (AN/FO) WAS RELEASED FROM THE TOP OF THE TRUCK ONTO THE GROUND.  THE TRUCK WAS EQUIPPED WITH A LOCKING-BAR MECHANISM DESIGNED TO KEEP THE HATCH LIDS FROM OPENING IN THE EVENT OF A ROLLOVER.  THE ACTUAL RELEASE WAS CAUSED WHEN A CORNER OF ONE OF THE HATCHES WAS BENT DURING THE ACCIDENT ALLOWING THE PRODUCT TO FLOW OUT OF THE TRUCK DURING THE ROLLOVER MOTION.  THE LOCKING BAR MECHANISM DID PREVENT THE HATCHES FROM OPENING.  THE SPILL WAS CLEANED UP THE SAME MORNING BY A QUALIFIED CONTRACTOR (ERS OF OHIO INC, WESTON, OH).  THE PRODUCT WAS COLLECTED IN DRUMS AND RETURNED TO WAMPUM HARDWARE'S STORAGE LOCATION WHERE IT WILL BE RECYCLED AND DISPOSED OF IN A FUTURE BLAST.  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO WAMPUM HARDWARE'S GARAGE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE OHIO STATE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.  POST ACCIDENT BRAKES TESTS WERE CONDUCTED BY PUCO (KELLY HEDGLIN).

On Monday, Dec. 7, I released rail car EAGX19001. On Tuesday, December 8, 1998, I released rail car GATX 61022. Wednesday, December 9, 1998, I called Sue to see if the rail cars had been pulled out. She said that she had given the cars to Bill Tilker. Sue said that if the cars were not pulled, to call her back. I got to Huntco Steel around 3:30 pm. The line had been down and it was about 6:00 pm when it was loaded. I arrived at the rail site around 6:30 pm and assumed that all three cars had been pulled. It was dark and there weren't any lights (which I have repeatedly asked for). The EAGX cars are brown. The GATX cars are white. I had three white GATX cars in a row. They all started with the number 61. The rail pulled two brown EAGX cars from the front. The third car was a white GATX that was also loaded. Instead of pulling the third car out they pushed it to the front with two other white GATX cars. I climbed up the rail car, opened the lid and put the hose in and strapped the hose down. I then hooked the hose to the truck, opened the valve and went to the front of the rail cars and put the blue flag up. I returned to the truck to start the air compressor. It was about 7pm. At about 7:30 pm the rail car started to run over. The pump holds the air at about 18PSI, which means that it blows off the acid at about 115 gallons a minute. It took about four minutes to shut the system down. I then checked to make sure that it didn't go into the road. I then called Harold Hinkle at his home to immediately report the spill. He said to make sure that it was contained in the smallest possible area by hauling in lime rock. I called Don Cocke and he called J.B. Gibbens. They brought lime rock and spread it on the spill to contain it. I went to the Blytheville Fire Department and reported the spill to the captain on duty. There wasn't any listing for the EPA in the Blytheville area. The fire dept. went over to the rail site and inspected the gravel containment and told me it was okay to go back to work.

WHILE THE LIQUID ON THE GROUND WAS DAMP, THERE WAS NO ACTIVE LEAK AT THE TIME OF INSPECTION.  ABSORBENT WAS PLACED OVER THE SPILL AREA, AND THE IMMEDIATE AREA WAS SECURED TO THROUGH TRAFFIC, EFFECTIVELY ISOLATING THE CONTAINER.  SINCE THE PRODUCT APPEARED TO HAVE COME FROM THE REAR DOORS OF THE CONTAINER, A DIAPER WAS PLACED ACROSS THE REAR PORTION OF THE CONTAINER IN ORDER TO CONTAIN ANY ADDITIONAL PRODUCT.  THE CONTAINER WAS THEN MOVED TO THE NORTH END CONTAINMENT AREA , WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED WITH PLASTIC SHEETING TO CONTAIN THE ENTIRE UNIT ONCE PLACED.  IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PRODUCT BEGAN LEAKING DURING THE MOVEMENT TO THE CONTAINMENT AREA, AND THE DIAPER EFFECTIVELY CONTAINED THE RUNOFF.

MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE YERMO YARD, AND UPON INSPECTING THE TOP AREA OF THE CAR, FOUND THE SOURCE OF THE LIQUID TO BE COMING FROM UNDER THE PROTECTIVE COVER FOR THE AIR AND LIQUID LINES.  A RUSTED CABLE SEAL SECURING THE KEEPER PIN WAS CUT AWAY AND WHEN THE PROTECTIVE COVER WAS OPENED, OBSERVED THE BALL VALVE FOR THE LIQUID LINE TO BE LAYING LOOSE INSIDE THE COMPARTMENT.  A RAG HAD BEEN STUFFED INTO THE LIQUID LINE OPENING, PRESUMED TO BE SOME FORM OF A PLUG TO PREVENT LIQUID FROM ESCAPING.  CLOSER INSPECTION NOTED THE FOUR MOUNTING FLANGE BOLTS WERE SEVERELY WORN, AND TWO COULD BE TURNED BY HAND.  IT APPEARED THAT SOMEONE HAD STARTED TO REPLACE THE FLANGE BOLTS AND DID NOT COMPLETE THE WORK.  ALL FOUR OF THE FLANGE BOLTS WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO REINSTALLING THE BALL VALVE, WHICH WOULD ALSO REQUIRE A NEW GASKET AND NEW FLANGE NUTS.
