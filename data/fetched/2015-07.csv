Driver noticed the leak during a stop at the address provided.  Driver reported leak through the Rineco Emergency Response Hotline.  Rineco's ER director immediately took steps to notify local, state and Federal agencies as required.  The Polk county sheriff department was called first to help control the scene do to the nature of chemical hazards present on the trailer.  The ER director then notified our nearest contract ER response team USES out of Deer Park Tx to mobilize.  Reporting to the NRC was completed as well as the TCEQ spill hotline: TCEQ report number 20152512.  Response proceeded smoothly with the help of the county law enforcement and fire.  Fire department covered liquid with oil dry absorbent until the contract responder arrived and made entry to trailer.  Drum was identified as the culprit and the response information and chemcial makeup was given to the onsite responders by Rineco ER director.  Drum look to have been punctured at some point by a nail.  Since this is a waste shipment it came from another original shipper.  The drum on the Rineco trailer was loaded directly on the floor of the trailer which is metal.  Appears that maybe the drum was nearly punctured before and finally gave away on the shipment to the next consignee.  All material was contained and overpacked or packed and removed from the incident with oversight of the Texas Department of Environmental Quality Rep onsite in response to the report to the state.",The response as is went as well as one could.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the temporary storage phase, facility personned noticed liquid material leaking from the bottom of a van trailer.  Facility personnel obtained the shipping document and profile information for the material loaded on the van trailer and determined that deploying granular absorbant in conjunction with spill boom was the appropriate immediate measure to contain the spread of the release.  Once containment had been secured internal notifications were made and facility personnel assembled a response team. First stage of full response was to use containment / spill trays under the leaking are to prevent additional material from hitting the ground.  Decontamination and clean up were concluded and all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and placed into suitable packages. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.  Upon conclusion of the cleanup the compromised container was inspected and it was observed that bolts securing the outlet valve body to the flange on the container were not sufficiently tight resulting in a slow leak.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed. Drivers will continue to inspect each container during staging period as well as before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity.

His 48' trailer had four skids of nonhazardous cargo in the nose and a 55 gallon drum of corrosive lqiuid strapped to the wall of the trailer in the last eight feet of the trailer.   Some time during the 1.5 mile trip from his previous stop, his pallet jack broke loose traveled approximately 30 feet in this trailer.   The pallet jack crashed in to the very bottom of the steel drum causing a puncture and and a release of corrosive liquid.  The driver was not aware of any release until he opened the door at the Frank Edmonds Company.  When his trailer was opened a significant amount of the corrosive liquid poured out the back door on to the surface below the dock door he was parked in.   Approximately 30-40 gallons of this corrosive liquid was vacumned out of the sewer located right below his trailer tires.  Spill Center was contacted and a remediation contractor was dispatched to the scene. The trailer was wiped clean, the punctured drum was over packed, and the release in the sewer was vacumned and placed in a drum for hazardous waste disposal.","Notices are being placed at all our driver locations warning all drivers to immediately replace any defective pallet jack straps.  The cause of this spill was failure on the part of the driver to use a proper functioning pallet jack strap.

KCS Environmental + Hazmat dispatched a response contractor to investigate.    Upon investigation, ice was discovered around the ""B"" End Liquid Line Valve secondary closure plug.  An inspection of the ""B"" End Liquid Line Valve revealed that the valve was not closed.  It took a full turn and a half of the valve wheel to secure the valve to a fully closed position.  The ""B"" End Liquid Line Valve and the secondary closure plug was found to be less than tool tight.  Additional deficiencies were noted.  The ""A"" End Liquid Line Valve secondary closure plug was less than tool tight.      File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

The driver immediately notified management and an in house response team was mobilized to the scene. The response team donned the proper PPE, located the leaking drum in the trailer, and over packed the drum into an approved salvage container. The drum was then transported to the original disposal facility without further incident. The Nebrask Department of Environmental Quality was notified. Operator Jim Borovich provided report #073115-jb-1220.","At the time the driver accepted the drums for transportation no evidence of leaking was observed. An internal investigation revealed that the container failed for two reasons.  1) The container closure was not tightly closed.  2) The container was not properly secured against movement in all directions which allowed the container to tip over in transit. The driver has been retrained to conduct a thorough inspection of each container before acceptance and if any evidence of a reduction in structural integrity is found to take the appropriate actions. Additionally, the driver was retrained in proper load securemnet.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the staging phase, it was discovered liquid material leaking from the van trailer and into containment.  Facility personnel obtained the shipping document and profile information for the material loaded and determined that deploying granular absorbant in conjunction with spill boom was the appropriate immediate measure to contain the spread of the release.  The failed container was identified and removed from the van trailer.  Visual inspection of the container showed the contents were leaking from the area where the valve attached to the bottle.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking was observed. Follow up investigation with the generating customer revealed that they had been provided a number of 275 gallon portable tanks with incompatible valves for the content.  Additionally the generating customer indicated they had had similar failures at their location.  Generating customer provided assurance that all suspect 275 gallon portable tote tanks have now been removed from service.

The driver reviewed the paperwork, sign the manifest and then moved the trailer forward to check and secure the load. The driver did not see any liquid on the floor of the trailer. The driver departed the customer site and as he was enroute to the destination facility a OH State Trooper pulled the driver over and notified him that something was leaking out the back of his trailer. The driver opened the doors and noticed that the trailer floor was wet. The driver placed a 5gal pail in the front corner of the trailer to catch any additional material that was leaking from the trailer. The local fire dept responded and dispersed speedi-dri to the contaminated area on the ground. Clean Harbors response team responded and found a 55gal steel drum with 2 puncture holes 3/4 way up on the drum. The drum was immediately overpacked and the the spilled material was cleaned up and released for transportation to the intended disposal facility.",Conducted meeting with customer to require drivers be present at the loading dock when van trailer's are being loaded at the customer site.

This was for the second half of a split load. The loader removed all 4 bolts from the product outlet flange on the top of the railcar. The flange was stuck on the product outlet so the loader used the wrench to pry it open.  The flange came loose and product immediately started flowing out of the product outlet. The peroxide sprayed the loader while he was coming down the railcar ladder. A fellow employee guided him to the safety shower and he began to remove his chemical suit and flush his eyes for approximately 15-20 minutes.  The loader felt some irritation in his left eye.  The loader was then taken to the emergency room for additional care. He was released from the hospital a short while later and followed up with a visit to Arrow’s medical clinic. There was no damage to his eye and was released to work with no restrictions. The terminal manager contacted Chemtrec, TRANSFLO, and the Arrow upper management. The manager also filed a report with the NRC. The report number is 1123937.        The railcar continued to spray product for about 20 minutes and then continued to bubble out until 10:30 AM. One of the loaders who responded to the spill hooked up the 2 inch water hose to the fire hydrant and flushed the railcar and the surrounding area until the product stopped flowing from the railcar. The AMS loader flushed the released material from 9:00 to 9:30am.  The fire department and police department arrived around 9:30 AM. The fire department hooked up the fire hydrant outside the front gate and closed the entrance to the terminal off for about 2 hours. They flushed the railcar for about ten minutes (from 10:20 – 10:30). The Fire Department then put on chemicals suits, climbed the railcar, and opened the dome lid to relieve the rest of the excess pressure. The Fire Department left shortly after. Hepaco arrived around 11:00  A.M. to dilute and clean up the peroxide. The peroxide and water puddled up by the drain since the drain valve was closed.  At appx 1:50pm the Philadelphia Water Department gave approval to open the storm drain and further dilute the remaining peroxide.  Prior to opening the drain, the liquid on the ground was tested by Arcadis and was 12% peroxide.      At appx. 1:50pm PWD advised the terminal to slowly open the drain valve while continuing to flush and measure concentrations until the concentration reached 0%, at which time they were to continue to flush with water for an additional 3 hours.    Hepaco flushed the area with water with a 1.5 inch hose for 4 hours and completed the job around 6:00 P.M.     The product remaining in the railcar was measured at 32 inches of outage. Arkema estimated that 1580 gallons of peroxide was released.","1. A stand down was held with the entire staff on 07/28/15 from Marc Scena at TRANSFLO.  2. A stand down was held with the entire staff on 07/30/15 from Mike DiNapoli and Philip Crouthamel.  3. On 07/28/15, all employees that load peroxide were instructed that all peroxide railcars need vented by opening the manway.   4. The entire Arrow Network had a safety standdown on 8/12 to discuss the importance of safety and following work instructions  5. Management will spot audit peroxide loads for compliance with the work instructions  6.

The operator had the driver put spill pads under the drip and he then notified dispatch of the leak.    OMI Repair facility was called out with a mechanic from our Baton Rouge terminal. The flange bolts between the internal and external valve were loose which caused a very slow drip from that flange from residual material in the line from loading through the outlet piping. The bolts were tightened and the leak was stopped. The customer inspected the trailer to make sure the problem was corrected and then allowed the trailer into their facility for offloading.

WHEN THE DRIVER WAS READY TO UNLOAD THE PREMIUM GASOLINE FROM THE TRAILER HE PULLED TWO HOSES FROM THE TRAILER AND LAID THEM SIDE BY SIDE. HE FIRST CONNECTED THE FITTING TO THE TANK AND THEN ONE OF THE TWO HOSES. WHEN HE RETURNED TO THE TRAILER HE PICKED UP THE WRONG HOSE END AND CONNECTED TO THE TRAILER.  WITHOUT REVIEWING HIS STEPS AND CHECKING THAT HE HAD CONNECTED THE CORRECT HOSE HE OPENED THE VALVE ALLOWING THE GASOLINE TO FLOW. HE IMMEDIATELY REALIZED HIS ERROR WHEN GASOLINE CAME OUT OF THE HOSE AND SHUT THE TRAILER VALVE OFF. THE TIME IT WAS OPEN WAS APPROXIMATELY THREE TO FIVE SECONDS ALLOWING APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 30 GALLONS OF PRODUCT TO ESCAPE FROM THE HOSE. THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY BEGIN USING PADS, SOCKS AND ABSORBENT TO COLLECT THE PRODUCT. UNFORTUNATELY THE GASOLINE TRAVELED FURTHER THAN HE COULD RESPOND TO AND ENTERED THE PARKING LOT STORM WATER RUNOFF.

THE RUNOFF RUNS ACROSS ONE ENTRANCE/EXIT, UNDER THE LANDSCAPING AND INTO ANOTHER STORM WATER RUNOFF AT THE OTHER ENTRANCE/EXIT.  THE STORM WATER RUNOFF EVENTUALLY EMPTIES INTO A DRY COLLECTION POINT FOR STORM WATER.  THE COLLECTION AREA IS DIRT, GRASS AND STONE. THE STORM WATER RUNOFF CONSISTS OF CONCRETE AND PIPE. THE CONCRETE PORTION IS OPEN AND COVERED WITH A METAL GRATE TO ALLOW VEHICLES TO PASS OVER. THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ALERTED AND RESPONDED TO THE SCENE. ON ARRIVAL THEY WERE ABLE TO ASSIST AND ADVISED THAT DUE TO DEBRIS IN THE DRAINS THAT NONE OF THE GAS WAS ABLE TO REACH THE CONTAINMENT AREA AND THAT IT HAD NOT ENTERED ANY SEWERS, WATERWAYS OR SOIL. AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRACTOR WAS CALLED (HEPACO, CONTACT: KARL HEEBNER, PH:215.739.3224) WHICH RESPONDED TO THE SCENE IN APPROXIMATELY 1HR. 30MINS.

Heritage Environmental contacted Haz-Mat Response, an emergency response service provider at approximately 8:30am to initiate a response to the spill and assist with clean-up.  At approximately 9:00am, Heritage representatives met with Haz-Mat Response, Inc. at Butler Transport, Inc. and conducted an initial site assessment and coordinated the response effort.  Based on the initial assessment, the 55 gallon container had inadvertently shifted forward in the trailer and leaked approximately 2/3 of it contents onto the trailer floor and exited the trailer and drained onto the asphalt pavement and soil adjacent to the pavement.    At 10:00am, the responding crew members of Haz-Mat arrived on-site and the Site Safety Plan was reviewed.  Haz-Mat Response crew neutralized the spilled material on the exterior of the trailer with a soda ash and water solution.  Clay absobent was then used to absorb the spilled material and neutralizing solution inside the trailer and on the ground.  Spill clean-up materials were placed into two 55 gallon containers, labeled and transported back to Heritage Environmental Services in Kansas City, Missouri.  After completing the initial site assessment and initiating response activities, the National Response Center and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment were notified by telephone.    The trailer arrived at the Heritage Environmental Services, LLC, Kansas City Missouri facility at approximately 11:45am, where an additional assessment and  inspection of the trailer and  its contents.  At approximately 1:00pm, the safety plan was reviewed with Heritage personnel.  Contaminated pallets were removed from the trailer and placed onto plastic liners inside the Heritage Storage Building.  Heritage personnel further neutralized the impacted wood pallets with a baking soda and water solution.  The pallets were allowed to dry and then placed onto an enddump destined for thermal destruction.  Spill response residues consisting of  clay absorbent, plastic liners, used personal protective equipment and visually impacted surface soil was placed into a 55-gallon plastic container and labeled.

THE UNIT TRAVELS FROM CONSTRUCTION SITE TO CONSTRUCTION SITE FOR JMAC TO COMPLETE IT WORKS. EQUIPMENT FUEL IS LOADED ONTO THE TRUCK IN JMAC’S YARD DAILY. IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE INCIDENT, THE DRIVE-SHAFT WAS REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE TO ALLOW ACCESS TO REPAIR SOME STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF THE SERVICE BODY. THIS WORK WAS COMPLETED BY A THIRD PARTY WELDING SHOP, NOT AFFILIATED WITH JMAC RESOURCES. WHEN THE DRIVER-SHAFT WAS RE-INSTALLED THE THIRD PARTY VENDOR, FAILED TO INSTALL THREADLOCK ON THE BOLTS HOLDING THE U-JOINT TOGETHER AND DID NOT INFORM JMAC OF THIS FAILURE.     WHILE TRAVELING ON HIGHWAY 1804 NEAR EAST DAKOTA PARKWAY IN WILLSTON ND, THE BOLTS CAME OUT OF THE YOKE AND THE U-JOINT CAME APART. THE SPINNING DRIVE SHAFT THEN WHIPPED AROUND RESULTING IN THE BREAKAGE OF THE RAPID RELEASE CHECK VALVE OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK, ALLOWING THE REMAINING CONTENTS (430 GALLONS) OF THE TANK TO EMPTY ONTO THE STREET. THE THREADED END OF THE THREE INCH VALVE THAT WAS THREADED INTO THE TANK BROKE. THE ENTIRE DURATION OF THE LEAK OCCURRED IN APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES.   DESPITE A RAPID RESPONSE TO THE INCIDENT BY WILLISTON FD AND THE DRIVER DEPLOYING HIS SPILL KIT, SOME FUEL WAS RELEASED INTO THE STORM SEWER. JMAC’S SPILL RESPONSE TEAM ARRIVED SHORTLY THEREAFTER AND PLACED BOOMS AND PADS AT THE OUTLET OF THE STORM DRAIN AND BELIEVE IT CAPTURED THE FUEL PRIOR TO ENTERING ANY WATER BODY. MOST OF THE FUEL WAS RECAPTURED USING JMAC VAC TRUCKS TO REMOVE FUEL FROM THE ROAD AND SKIM FUEL FROM THE STORM SEWER. IT WAS THEN PROCESSED TO CLEANUP FOR SALE FOR RE-FINING. SOME MINOR ABSORBENT MATERIALS, BOOMS AND PADS WERE USED TO CLEAN THE PAVEMENT AND WERE DISPOSED OF IN THE NEARBY SMALL VOLUME INDUSTRIAL WASTE LANDFILL (IHD SOLIDS MANAGEMENT). THE STORM SEWER WAS PRESSURE WASHED. BOOMS REMAINED IN PLACE FOR A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE INCIDENT.","THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE FAILURE BY THE WELDER TO RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR THREADLOCK ON THE U-JOINT BOLTS. HAD A MECHANIC, FAMILIAR WITH PROPER PROCEDURES FOR THE DRIVELINE COMPLETED THE WORK, THE INCIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED. THE THIRD PART VENDOR WAS ADMONISHED FOR THIS FAILURE.   THE BODY MANUFACTURER COULD HAVE INSTALLED A GUARD OVER THE DRIVELINE THAT MAY HAVE PREVENTED THE DRIVESHAFT FROM CONTACTING THE VALVE/PIPING. THIS MAY HAVE LIMITED THE VISUAL OBSERVATION OF THE TRUCK BODY HOWEVER AND LEAD TO A SIMILAR INCIDENT AS THE RESULT OF THE DAMAGE THAT WAS BEING REPAIRED THAT LEAD TO THE BOLTS BEING REMOVED IN THE FIRST PLACE.   A REQUIREMENT THAT THE RAPID RELEASE CHECK VALVE BE INTERNAL TO THE TANK MAY HAVE MINIMIZED THE SPILL.   THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME WARNING IN THE FORM OF VIBRATION PRIOR TO THE DRIVELINE FAILURE, HOWEVER THE TRUCK HAS AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION WHICH MAY HAVE OBSCURED ANY VIBRATION. SINCE THE BOLTS WOULD LIKELY HAVE APPEARED TIGHT DURING THE PRE AND POST TRIP INSPECTIONS, THE DRIVER WOULD NOT HAVE HAD ANY FURTHER WARNING OF THE IMPENDING INCIDENT.",Yes,,,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,70301,JMAC RESOURCES INC,US,

He used a hammer to tap the side of the pump to try and clear the clog.  He then cracked the bleeder valve on the top side of the pump (not the normal bleeder valves that should have been used) and that’s when the gallon of product came out it sprayed driver face under the face shield.  The operator who was unloading shut down the product flow and driver went into the chemical shower. The driver had on most of the PPE that we require but instead of wearing chemical goggles he was wearing safety glasses with side shields.  The plant nurse didn’t observe any redness or obvious signs of irritation and doesn't seem to think he needed immediate medical attention but suggested he wait awhile and if it’s still irritated, he could go to the clinic that they use.  Driver did go to the clinic and checked out ok.  He has been feeling fine since.",In my tenure at Schneider (18 years) this is a first for our team.  This was a driver behavior / decision making issue.  We have brought him in and went through what we call PET (Performance Enhancement Training) that focuses on what what went wrong and why and what to do in the future.  ie - if he can't get product flowing by normal means he / she should be shutting down and contacting safety for support on what to do next.  Driver understands moving foward what needs to happen.  If something of this nature happens again he will be on a signed Commitment To Excellence agreement where his employment with Schneider will be severed if it happens again.  We may forgo the Commitment to Excellence and sever ties depending on the circumstances.,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,
