The trailer then was accepted into the ten day storage facility of the intended waste disposal facility.","The driver recalled that when loading the trailer, the shipper's personnel pushed against the drums with the forklift to make room for the remaining drums.  At the time, no damage was noticed.  However, it was determined that the lock ring on one of the drums had been damaged by the action causing the seal to be compromised and begin leaking.  The material had also separated in transit, and some liquid subsequently was what leaked out.

Shows that 90% ullage was 456 gallons after delivery. Catoosa County Fire Dept and Ringgold police responded. Per Deputy Chief of Fire Dept, no cleanup other than what we did was/is needed. Jacob and I were at the scene shortly after incident occurred. We did end up dropping 284 gallons RUL into the mid-grade tank. Will need to ""fix"" that on next delivery. When driver noticed product overflowing, he quickly shut off the flow of product. Product was still overflowing so he switched drop fitting from RUL tank to Mid-Grade tank to relieve pressure in tank and keep product in hose from hitting the ground.

(A•C•T) Nationwide Project Manager, Mr. Gary L. Weiss to request assistance with a leaking drum of Benzyl Salicyate (UN 3082, Environmentally Hazardous Substances). The spill occurred at 2723 Carl Road in Irving, Texas. Mr. Nelson advised that Tracy Shuler, the Souther Refrigeraed driver noticed an odor coming from the trailer. , At this point an unknown amount of product was released inside the trailer.  Mr. Weiss contacted Mr. Shuler, to determine if any product had leaked out of the trailer.  Mr. Shuler reported that no product has leaked out of the trailer. At this time no regulatory reporting was required due to the unknown amount of product lost.    Our response team began the cleanup process by marking the leak point on the drum and placing it into a an over pack drum.  The contaminated pallets was removed from the trailer and placed into a 55-gallon drum.  Sorbents were used to clean the trailer floor.    Once the floor was cleaned the sorbents and PPE were added to the drum of pallets for disposal.    Per Mr. Eric Nelson, the over packed drum was reloaded into the trailer, properly blocked and braced for continued transport.     WASTE DISPOSAL    As a result of the response activities, one (1) 55-gallon drum of contaminated wood, PPE and sorbents was generated.

The movement was stopped and the responder instructed AMCX 25745 to be carefully moved back to the repair track area for a detailed securement inspection. Inspection of the manway closure revealed that the manway gasket applied was crimped with a section of the gasket (approximately 1/4 of the gasket circumference) folded over. The responder applied a new manway gasket and tool tightened all manway securement bolts. Intact seal INEOS 119745 was replaced by seal numbered 1095270.

During the inspection process the officer discovered a small amount of lead material on the side of a drum and on top of the pallet under the drum. The officer wrote on the inspection report a release of a hazardous material from its package. He contributed the release to a loose ring around the drum. The non-bulk package this material was in was a 55 gallon steel drum that contained apx. 900 pounds of this material.       Our investigation determined the material was spilled at the shipper during the process of loading the material into the drum. It was not spilled while loading the truck nor was there a package failure. (The pictures taken show the material on the side of the drum and on top of the pallet next to the drum. There was stretch-wrapping placed around the drums by the shipper before it was loaded into the truck. The material is under the stretch-wrapping.)    The material was in a semi-molten state when it was spilled onto the side of the drum. It had hardened before being placed onto the truck for transportation. The material was contained where it at hardened onto the drum and the pallet. The spilled material was removed by the receiver and recycled with the material that was in the drums.",We contacted the shipper of the material after the event. The event was investigated with their assistance. During this investigation it was determined that the material was spilled while the drum was being loaded at their facility. They informed us they have implemented additional procedures to prevent material being filled into the drums to escape.

Driver was treated on site and then transferred to a hospital for both treatment of burns on his hands and possible inhalation of vapors. Driver was kept overnight for observations and released the next day with topical medication for his hands.   Incident commander was contacted by ERTS (carrier's emergency response management company) to determine if further assistance was required. ERTS was advised that I-44 WB was shut down as a precautionary measure and that traffic was diverted to a service road.  As additional assistance was requested, ERTS dispatched an environmental contractor to the scene. After local Haz-Mat units completed their evaluation, environmental contractor was allowed to inspect the intermediate bulk containers (IBCs). THe IBCs were visually inspected, loose closures were tightened and the IBCs were staged on poly sheeting in the rest area. The trailer was inspected for free liquids, with none being found. After reinspection of the IBCs, the IBCs were loaded back onto the trailer and the load was secured.

The driver shut off flow of product. The driver then attempted to release the pressure off the hose by loosening the lock down on the tank. This caused product to leak from the hose and overfill tank into the containment area. Approximately 50 gallons leaked. The fire department and ADEM were called to the scene. The site was cleaned up by all personnel. It was determined that the tanks had a vapor tight recovery system which causes pressure build up and inaccurate stick readings. The driver needed to go by veeder root readings and not only stick readings. The driver followed prodcedure until he broke the seal between the lockdown and the tank.","The driver was retrained on unloading procedures. All drivers were required to attend a safety meeting on how to follow procedures, including covering stick and veeder root readings, and what to do if a tank fills up.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Florida Rock and Tank Lines,US,

High Street; Suite 200,Pottstown,PA,19464,Other-Terminal Operator acting,"On 2/23 at 3:00 PM, while attempting to break down an Occidential Chemical tank car GATX 22445 that was spotted toward the east end of track # 566 containing 156,400 lbs of Sodium Hydroxide Solutions 50% (Class 8; UN 1824; PG II), TRANSFLO - Cleveland East Ops Manager - Mike Nelson was sprayed with product from the tank car liquid education line valve assembly without a tank car fitting being applied. Lead Operator - Mike Vouk who was working on a tank car in the vicinity heard the commotion and saw that Mr. Nelson was in distress on the top of GATX 22445. Mr. Nelson was able to successfully get down off the top of the tank car’s platform, as product continued to spray from the aforementioned valve assembly. Mr. Vouk went to the ‘steam access’ side of the car in anticipation of ascending the railcar from that side, he then determined that the other side of the car would have the least risk for exposure and returned back to the north side of Track #556 (area by the office) and ascended the tank car’s ladder. Mr. Vouk was then able to safely shut off the liquid education line/standpipe valve and minimize the release of material. At this point in time Mr. Nelson shredded his PPE which included: Chemical Protective Acid Gear (Overalls and Jacket; Hard Hat; Face Shield; Chemical Spash Goggles, Chemical Resitant Gloves; etc.). Mr. Vouk then proceeded to escort Mr. Nelson to the office industrial shower/bathroom facility, where Mr. Nelson proceeded to rinse out his eyes in the sink and utilize the shower which did not have ample water available (e.g., obstructed water line). Mr. Vouk then contacted Cleveland’s CSR/Coordinator, Ms. Helen Longo who previous left for the day via her cell phone, where he request her to contact 911 and have an ambulance dispatched to the terminal immediately. Mr. Vouk then proceeded to escort Mr. Nelson to A&R Transport (neighboring business), in order to utilize their facility’s safety shower and eyewash station. While over at A&R, Mr. Vouk then asked them to ensure that 911 was dispatched to the TRANSFLO - Cleveland East terminal within the CSX Collinwood rail yard off East  152nd Street. Mr. Vouk then left Mr. Nelson over at A&R Transportation in order to retrieve the MSDS for Occidential Chemical’s Sodium Hydroxide Solutions 50%. At this point in time, ~ 3:20 PM, Local Police, EMS and Fire Department arrived onsite to treat Mr. Nelson and transport him to the local hospital (Metro Health Medical  Center Burn Unit).

CELX 1266 was cordoned-off awaiting detailed inspection from hazardous material responders.

The responders closed the liquid valve and tool tightened its closure plug. The liquid valve's operating handle was adjusted to fit under the closed valve housing cover when the operating handle was in the full closed position.  Spillage was neutralized and rinsed. The responders also reported that during their detailed inspection of CELX 1266 other securement deficiencies were corrected at the vapor valve closure plug and the securement nuts/bolts on all valve flanges.

The truck struck the Bobtail causing it to roll.    The tank support on the Bobtail received damage and the unit could not be placed upright until the propane was flared off.    A 2 inch pipe nipple that screws into the back check valve on the back of the truck was leaking for a short amount of time.  After this uncontrolled release was stopped the controlled release/flare off of the tank lasted approximately 14 hours.","The company has a rollover prevention policy titled, ""SLIP OFF STAY OFF"" with cab posters and training reminders.  The idea is to bring the vehicle under control without attempting to radically change the path which can cause liquid load shifting and add to the potential for overturn.  After each such accident a committee reviews the investigative facts to determine whether the driver followed company safety practices and whether disciplinary actions are appropriate. Our employees receive recurrent training for defensive driving, proper backing techniques and how to prevent rollovers.

The transfer was stopped and the Fire Depart., Shelby County EMA, and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) were notified.  Released product traveled from the underground storage tank (UST) area, east-northeast across the concrete surface and entered two storm drain inlets located along the eastern portion of the property.  Product accumulated in each drop inlet and the connector pipe.  Some product also accumulated in the discharge pipe but it did not appear to traverse through this pipe to the oulet located on the northern portion of the property.  Oil dry was applied to visually affected surface areas and a vacuum truck was used to remove product from the drop inlets.  In addition, water from the fire department truck (approximately 750 gallons) was used to flush the connector line and aid in sediment/debris removeal from the drop inlets.  Once this was completed the residual water at the bottom of the inlets appeared to be relatively clear.  Absorbent booms were placed within the storm drain at the discharge point (NE portion of property) and NE drop inlet.

MORRISON,TECHNICAL SERVICES SPECIALIST,328 Bunola River Road,Bunola,PA,15020,Carrier,Company driver was unloading a shipment at the consignee when he noticed that one of the drums in the order was leaking.  Upon inspection of the freight he saw that the E-track clip on a load securement strap had gouged a hole in the upper chime of the drum.  The clip was positioned between the drum and the side of the trailer.  The motion during the transportation of the drum from the shipper location to the consignee location apparently forced the clip into the chime resulting in a small leak of less than 2 liquid gallons.  The driver obtained his overpack from underneath his trailer and placed the damaged drum inside with the assistance from consignee employees.  The spilled material was cleaned up by the driver.  The overpack was labeled and brought back to the shipping facility for disposition.    The spilled material was determined to be unsalable and was disposed of with other branch waste materials.,Shipper/carrier employees were informed of this incident during regularly scheduled safety meetings.  Shipper employees were instructed to avoid placing the clip on the chime and also to position the clip to ensure that it will not become trapped between the side of the trailer and the freight.  A specific labeled location has been created for returned damaged goods to ensure a timely inspection and disposition of questionable goods in the future.  The returned goods authorization (RGA) process will be reviewed with all personnel to assure that an RGA is created immediately for any damaged and undelivered product(s).,No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA Inc.,US,

The rail trans-load facility was responsible for transferring the fly ash from the dry bulk trailer to the rail car according to the contract.  However, the driver of the dry bulk trailer was asked to assist by the rail trans-load facility and this request for assistance was not made known to the highway carrier.  During the transfer of the fly ash from the dry bulk trailer, material began to leak out at the hose connection at the rear of the dry bulk trailer.  The driver of the dry bulk trailer attempted to assist the facility operators and secure the hose connection, but the hose completely disconnected from the dry bulk trailer.  Approximately 1800 to 2000 pounds of fly ash was spilled to the ground surface.  The dry bulk trailer driver and two people from the rail trans-load facility were covered in dust.  The driver had the fly ash dust rinsed-off and then went to the hospital to be examined but was not admitted.  To the best of our knowledge, the two rail trans-load personnel did not go to the hospital and had the fly ash dust rinsed-off at their facility.","Operator should have shut-off the blower, bleed off any pressure and completely stopped the unloading of the fly ash before attempting to secure the loose hose connection at the rear of the dry bulk trailer.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,3,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,34585,"QUALITY CARRIERS, INC.",US,
