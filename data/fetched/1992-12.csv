WHEN HEROLLED UP THE DOOR ON THE TRAILER, HE NOTICED THAT THE FLOOR WAS WET AND ASTRONG ODOR WAS BEING EMITTED FROM THE TRAILER. HE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED THE DOORTO THE TRAILER. HE WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND ONCE AGAIN TO VIEW THE INSIDE OFTHE TRAILER, BUT WAS UNABLE TO BECAUSE OF THE ODOR. FROM LOOKING AT THE FREIGHTBILLS, HE WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT HE WAS HAULING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. HECALLED THE DISPATCHER WHO TOLD HIM TO GO TO THE DURHAM TERMINAL SINCE HE WAS SOCLOSE TO THIS LOCATION. AFTER ARRIVING AT THE DURHAM TERMINAL, HE PARKED THETRAILER. HE CONSULTED RON MILLS, DIRECTOR OF MAINTENANCE, WHO THEN CALLEDCHEMTREC TO NOTIFY THEM OF THE PROBLEM. THE DURHAM COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT ANDHAZARDOUS MATERIALS TEAM WERE ALERTED TO THE PROBLEM. THEY ARRIVED A SHORT TIMELATER AND BEGAN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE AMOUNT AND EXTENT OF THE SPILL.THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND HAZARDOUS MATERIAL TEAM DETERMINED AT THE COMPLETION OFTHE THEIR WORK THAT A CORRUGATED CARD BOARD BOX HELD THE LIQUID THAT LEAKED.INSIDE THE BOX WAS A POLYURETHENE BLADDER WHICH CONTAINED 5 1/4 GALLONS OF 360FIXER PART A AND A QUART BOTTLE OF ACETIC ACID. THE FINDINGS OF THE HAZARDOUSMATERIALS TEAM WAS THAT THE BLADDER CONTAINING THE FIXER WAS LEAKING.ENVIRO-CHEM, INC. WAS CONTACTED CONCERNING THE CLEAN UP AND DISPOSITION OF THEITEMS THAT WERE IN THE BOX, INCLUDING THE BOX. MR. TRACY CLARK INDICATED THATTHE LIQUID ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER COULD BE NEUTRALIZED WITH SODIUMCOARBONATE. ENVIRO-CHEM DISPOSED OF THE BLADDER AND PUT THE REMAINING LIQUIDINTO THREE GLASS JARS. THE BOTTLE  OF ACETIC ACID WERE GIVEN TO MR. RICHARDESTERLING, A REPRESENTATIVE OF ANITEC, THE COMPANY WHICH SHIPPED THE FRIGHT.THE REMAINDER OF THE FREIGHT THAT WAS ON THE TRAILER WAS DELIVERED WITH THEEXCEPTION OF ONE CARTON OF THE ACETIC ACID SOLUTION AND 1 BOX OF PHOTOGRAPHERSMATERIAL FAX 70, THESE WERE BEING RETURNED TO THE SHIPPER. THE CAUSE OF THESPILL HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. A MR. ROGER SCHUMER, AND ENVIRONMENT ENGINEER,WITH ANITEC INDICATED DURING A PHONE CONVERSATION THAT THERE HAD BEEN PROBLEMSWITH THE CAP ON THE BLADDER AND SAID THAT THERE HAD BEEN LEAKAGE IN THE PASTAROUND THE CAP. MR. EASTERLING INDICATED THAT THE BLADDER WOULD NOT LEAK,UNLESS THE ITEM WAS DROPPED. THERE WAS NO INDICATION FROM THE CONDITION OF THEBOX THAT IT HAD BEEN DROPPED. THE CAP TO THE  BLADDER WAS DISCOVERED BY MR.EASTERLING AND WAS BROKEN.
