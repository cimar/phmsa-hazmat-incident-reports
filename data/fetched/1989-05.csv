THE SITUATION WAS DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS:  A 6000 GALLON TANK-TRUCK FROM NAPPI TRUCKING PICKED UP 4890 GALS OF WASTE FLAMMABLE LIQUID FROM DEL LABORATORIES IN FARMINGDALE, NEW YORK.  THE LOAD WAS TO BE DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO INDUSTRIAL SOLVENTS AND CHEMICAL CORP. IN YORK HAVEN, PENNSYLVANIA, FOR DISPOSAL BY INCINERATION. LOADING OF THE MATERIAL TOOK LONGER THAN EXPECTED, BEING COMPLETED AT 1655 HRS ON 5/30/89. DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE DISPOSAL FACILITY CLOSED AT NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS, THE LOAD WAS BROUGHT TO THE NAPPI TRUCKING FACILITY IN OLD BRIDGE, ARRIVING THERE AT 1915 HOURS. THE TRUCK WAS INTENDED TO DEPART AGAIN FOR PENNSYLVANIA AT 0500 HRS ON 5/31/89. AT APPROXIMATELY 2100 HOURS, THE SAFETY VALVE AND RUPTURE DISK ON THE TRAILER BLEW WITH A LOUD NOISE AND CONTINUED TO RELEASE PRESSURE FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 1/2 HRS. (UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 2230). EYEWITNESSES STATED THAT A BLUE-GREEN CLOUD WAS EMITTED DURING THE FIRST MINUTES OF RELEASE.  WIND WAS FROM THE WEST AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, AND RESIDENTS AND POLICE REPORTED A SWEET SOLVENT ODOR EAST OF THE FACILITY. AT THE TIME OF THIS RESPONDER'S ARRIVAL, A TEAM FROM CHEESEQUAKE FIRE DEPT AND MIDDLESEX HAZMAT HAD JUST COMPLETED AN INSPECTION OF THE TANKER.  NO LEAKS OR RELEASE OF PRESSURE WERE OBSERVED, HOWEVER, THE EXTERNAL TEMPERATURE OF THE TANK WAS MEASURE AT 128F. AIR MONITORING INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO VAPORS BLOWING OFF-SITE. NJ ROUTE 34 WAS CLOSED BY THE OLD BRIDGE POLICE AS A SAFETY PRECAUTION AND TO ACCOMODATE THE LARGE NUMBER OF EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT AT THE SCENE. IN ADDITION THE ONLY FIRE HYDRANTS IN THE AREA WERE LOCATED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY FROM THE FACILITY. POLICE SGT ROBERT BONFANTE NOTIFIED SGT MCCARTY (NJSP-OEM) OF THE ROAD CLOSURE AND ONGOING INCIDENT. AN EXAMINATION OF THE WASTE MANIFEST PROVIDED BY RAPLH NAPPI INDICATED THAT THE MATERIAL IN THE TANKER WAS A FLAMMABLE LIQUID (F003) AND INDICATED ACE TONE AND ETHYL ACETATE AS CONSTITUENTS. MIDDLESEX HAZ MAT RESPONDER MAT FITZGERALD SPOKE WITH DR WOODS OF DEL LABS, AND WAS TOLD THAT THE MATERIAL SHIPPED WAS WASTE FROM NAILPOLISH PRODUCTION AND THAT IT ALSO CONTAINED A SMALL AMOUNT OF NITRO CELLULOSE. WOODS STATED THAT THE WASTE WAS NOT REACTABLE AND WOULD GEL IF WATER WAS ADDED. THE WASTE HAD BEEN CONTAINED AT THE DEL LABS FACILITY IN A NUMBER OF DRUMS PRIOR TO REMOVAL BY NAPPI'S TANK-TRUCK. 1) THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE EXOTHERMIC REACTION IN THE WASTE WAS NOT DETERMINED, HOWEVER IT MAY HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE DECOMPOSITION OF NITROCELLULOSE. 2) 1800 GALLONS OF THE WASTE WAS RELEASED AS VAPOR AND LIQUID FROM THE TRAILER ON 5-30-89. 3) THE CONTAMINANTS RELEASED WERE MOST LIKELY THE VOLATILE COMPONENTS SUCH AS: ACETONE, TOLUENE, AND ETHYL ACETATE. 4) NO PUBLIC HEALTH EFFECTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO DEP AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT.
