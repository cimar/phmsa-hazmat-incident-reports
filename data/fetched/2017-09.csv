Advised Mr. Tu that we could either dispatch a contractor for clean-up or he could attempt to clean it up himself without creating a dust cloud. He advised that he felt comfortable cleaning it up himself. Product was swept up and placed into a 40 gallon steel drum.  Cargo was on Trailer #XTRA13029. Wenck Associates responded to the spill. They cleaned out a 40 gallon steel drum that had Copper Sulfate in it.

While driving south, an oncoming northbound SUV crossed the center-line and drove toward the shoulder of the HG driver's lane. To avoid a head-on collision, the HG driver steered left.  The front end of his bobtail clipped the front passenger side of the SUV, causing the tanker truck to roll over and land on its rooftop along the east side of the highway.  The SUV came to rest along the west side of the highway.  Damage to the piping on the back of the bobtail caused a propane leak, which ignited.     The fire department and Hawaii Gas responders determined that since the fire posed no immediate danger to life or property, the safest option was to let the fire burn and keep firefighting water on the vapor space of the tank to control the inner pressure.  The police and fire departments contained the situation and closed the highway for approximately 44 hours (it took approximately 39 hours for the propane to burn off).     Other than the damage to the tanker truck, all other property damage and personal injury suffered were caused by the impact of the traffic collision and were not related to the fire.  The HG driver sustained serious injuries from the collision and was transported to Hilo Medical Center for treatment.  The driver and rear seat passenger (child) of the SUV were uninjured.  However, the female occupant in the front passenger seat died at the scene of the accident.","The police report for this incident indicated that the SUV driver was inattentive, which caused him to cross the center-line.  One possible solution may be for the County to add rumble strips to two-lane highways to alert inattentive drivers when they cross the center-line.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,66700,Hawaii Gas,US,

THE UNIT WAS LOADED WITH RED DYE DIESEL (OFF ROAD DIESEL) IN ROUTE TO HASLET, TX. THE CARGO TANKER IS A BOTTOM LOAD TANKER. AFTER LOAD COMPLETION UNIT 403 TRAVELED APPROXIMATELY .56 MILES WHEN THE DRIVER NOTICED THE PRODUCT ON THE OUTER SHELL OF CARGO TANKER 403. HE THEN IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND CALLED INTO THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT. AFTER SAFETY ARRIVED IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE PRODUCT WAS RELEASED FROM THE CLEAN OUT PORTS. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TANKER IS A SINGLE COMPARTMENT DOT407 DOUBLE CONICAL CARGO TANKER. THE UNIT HAS 4 CLEAN OUT PORTS EVENLY SPACED FROM FRONT TO BACK ON THE VERY TOP ALIGNED IN THE CENTER OF THE SHELL.   PRIOR TO BEING LOADED THE TRAILER WAS DOWN FOR REPAIRS AT A LOCAL 3RD PARTY VENDOR WHERE THE UNIT WAS INTERNALLY STEAMED OUT. AFTER THE STEAM OUT PROCESS THE CLEAN OUR PORT CLOSURES WERE NOT REINSTALLED. THE 3RD PARTY VENDOR CLEARED THE UNIT TO BE PUT BACK IN SERVICE AND DIDN’T REALIZE THE CAPS OF THE PORTS WERE NEVER REINSTALLED. THE CAPS, GASKETS, AND HARDWARE WAS FOUND STORED IN THE “CROW’S NEST” ON TOP OF THE TRAILER DURING OUR INTERNAL INVESTIGATION. THIS WAS NOT NOTICED BY THE DRIVER DUE TO THE TRAILER BEING A BOTTOM LOAD/UNLOADED AND THE COMPANY POLICY WHERE LION OIL DOES NOT ALLOW DRIVERS ON TOP OF CARGO UNITS WITHOUT FALL PROTECTION.   AS THE DRIVER OF CARGO TANKER UNIT 403 PROCEEDED IN HIS ROUTE EACH TIME HE WOULD ACCELERATE OR COME TO A SLOW/STOP THE SLOSH OF THE PRODUCT WOULD FORCE OUT OF THE CLEAN OUT PORTS THAT WERE OPEN ON TOP OF THE CARGO TANKER. DURING THIS EVENT PRODUCT RELEASED ONTO THE SMALL SECTION OF ROADWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 35 GALLONS. A LOCAL HAZMAT REMEDIATION COMPANY WAS CONTACTED AND CLEANUP STARTED WITHIN 2 HOURS.",ACTIONS TAKEN TO PREVENT RECURRENCE: WE HAVE WORKED WITH LOCAL VENDOR TO DO A CHECK THROUGH ONCE A UNIT HAS BEEN RETURNED TO SERVICE TO PREVENT FUTURE RECURRENCES. IF THE UNIT IS NOT YET RETURNABLE TO SERVICE THE VENDOR WILL INSTALL A GLAD HAND LOCK ON THE SERVICE AIR SUPPLY TO KEEP THE UNIT FROM BEING OPERATED. THE VENDOR WILL ALSO INSTALL THE GLAD HAND LOCK IF THE UNIT IS STILL IN PROCESS OF BEING REPAIRED TO PREVENT THE UNIT FROM BEING OPERATED.  THE VENDOR WILL ALSO INSTALL THE GLAD HAND LOCK IF THE UNIT IS STILL IN PROCESS OF BEING REPAIRED TO PREVENT THE UNIT FROM BEING OPERATED.

Bulk tank container SNEU 600244 was inspected and noted a clear gel like substance dripping from the main bottom discharge valve, hardening at the base of the unit, spilling approximately 5 ounces. The end cap of the valve was missing the end cap from the valve, the top man way area was contaminated with residue from a previous loading unloading.  In the interest of safety, this unit was placed on hold from being loaded onto a railcar and then moved to a containment pit area pending inspection of  the tank. This unit was billed as an empty, however the unit had class 8 placarding (Corrosive) displayed on all four sides, with a description reading   DIDECYLDIMETHYLAMMONIUM CHLORIDE DISINFECTANTS, LIQUID. Approved Hazmat contractor United Pumping Services was called out to test the spilled product for Hazmat properties and to confirm if the unit contained product  residue. The spilled product tested positive for acidic hazardous properties, responder was able to confirm that this unit appeared to contain residue inside from a previous shipment, matching the properties from the spilled product. All contaminated areas associated with the leak were remediated by United Pumping Services and applied a new end cap on the main discharge valve.","Per the BNSF Intermodal Rules and Policies Guide, empty portable tank container that previously contained hazardous commodities or has hazardous  residue must be billed with the appropriate STCC code.

He called the Brewster Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis Environmental Officer for WLE.  I came out and investigated the leak and found that the Liquid Valve on the B end of the car was leaking.  The valve was leaking through the valve plug.  I tried to tighten the valve to see if the leak would stop and it would not.  I cycled the valve open and closed to see if ice was in the valve seat but I could still not get it to stop leaking.  The leak was quite strong.  I was able to tighten the loose valve plug and get the leak to stop.  I had the car set to the shop for further investigation.  The shipper of the car had Sunpro come out to look at it and they said they valve needed replaced.  On 10-9-2017, Sunpro came out and flared the vapors off the car and replaced the B end Liquid Valve.  Then they put Nitrogen to the car to bubble test it.  The car passed the bubble test and was released for transportation.  They installed a new seal on the protective housing of #1607012.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the unloading operation  the pallet of drums was placed on uneven concrete floor.  As the forklift operator approached the pallet, readied his forks through the pallet, the pallet broke causing the forks to strike the drum.  The operator immediately stopped work and placed the drum on its side, added absorbent pads and halted the leak.    Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised  container into a suitable salvage drum. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor were collected and placed into the salvage drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.  The forklift operator was pulled from forklift operations pending investigation and retraining.","Since the root cause of the incident was determined to be unsafe forklift operation, a review of the incident and the unsafe practices was immediately reviewed with SKS  shipping and receiving technician(s).   Forklift operator will be formally retrained in loading and unloading, pallet integrity, as well as forklift operations.   Additionally all drivers, dock personnel, warehouse personnel, and material handlers will ensure pallets are checked as thoroughly as they check the containers so as to ensure integrity of the pallet and its support of the containers resting on them.

Facility personnel immediately deployed boom and absorbent to prevent the spread of the release.  A response crew was notified, donned the appropriate personal protective equipment, entered the truck, unloaded the leaking cubic yard box, and opened the box to investigate. The box inner liner was found to have been punctured, likely during loading; the box did not contain sufficient absorbents to contain a spill if there was an issue with one of the inner paint cans.  The response crew checked the integrity and closures of the inner containers and repacked the contents into a new cubic yard box of appropriate specification for the material; sufficient absorbent was added to the box to prevent another accidental release.

THE DRIVER HEAVILY APPLIED THE BRAKE AND ATTEMPTED TO STEER THE VEHICLE BACK ONTO THE ROAD. HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE TRUCK BACK ON THE ROAD, BUT THE TRAILER REMAINDER OFF AS HE ROLLED NEARLY TO A STOP.

As he was positioned squarely filling the diesel fill on the split gas/diesel AST, he brought the nozzle out slightly to view the tank level. Just as he did this, his left foot lost grip on the stairway he was standing on to access the tank fills and he slid back, falling against the railing. The motion caused the nozzle to come out of the tank and spray out. Since it was on a swivel, it spun around, spraying diesel on both sides of the tank. This tank is located on a concrete dock adjacent to Lake Union, and about 2 oz of the spill also splashed into the Lake. The driver quickly shut off the flow and deployed clean-up materials for the free product. Most had dropped to the concrete and asphalt in a ""splash"" fashion and the height from which is splashed from caused the spill to appear larger than it was. It was estimated that the total spill was less than 10 gallons, with the before mentioned 2 oz reaching the lake. Taryn Olson went to the scene and made appropriate notifications for the Department of Ecology and dispatched NRC Environmental for clean-up. Ecology reps onscene viewed the spill and lake and made the determination of the 2 oz spill to the lake, as no visible sheen remained present. NRC cleaned up the affected asphalt and concrete, being careful not to allow any of the wash water to drip into the lake. While Taryn was onscene, driver re-created the position he had been in and how the spill had occurred. Through investigation with him, it was determined that the root caused was that the tread on his safety boot was worn, which caused him to lose the grip in his stance and fall backward, spilling the product. Driver stated he would be purchasing new boots right away. This spill was NOT the result of any packaging or equipment failure.","Better PPE program for boots, additional training for filling when standing on platforms/stairways like this.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2530,"Associated Petroleum Products, Inc.",US,

While opening the trailer door to begin offloading, the employee noticed a stream of liquid product along the right half of the trailer.  The employee reported the findings and offloading began with the supervision of the management team. A single drum of liquid flammable hazardous waste was identified as the source of the spill and the puncture location was spotted just under the bolt ring on the open top drum. The drum was then placed into a steel overpack and labeled with the appropriate hazardous waste label. The Dupre trailer itself contained less than one gallon of liquid which then was recovered and disposed.  There also was no evidence that any amount of the spill escaped the trailer during transport. The employee continued offloading the remaining waste from the shuttle to ensure no additional drums were identified. No additional drums were spotted and all waste was placed into the 10 day transit area.",Reviewed incident with the Pittsburgh branch and requested that they load drums of waste and orient the drums to keep the bolts on the rings from coming into contact with another drum.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar Solutions,US,
