THE TRAIN (Q37518) WAS BROUGHT SAFELY TO A STOP ON THE WESTBOUND MAIN TRACK IN THE YARD AT BRUNSWICK, MD. THE TRAIN CREW OBSERVED A HEAVY VAPOR CLOUD COMING FROM THE VALVE CONTROL BOX LOCATED ON THE SIDE, LOWER HALF OF THE CAR. PERSONNEL AT THE YARD CONTACTED THE APPROPRIATE PARTIES AND INITIATED ISOLATION AROUND THE AREA OF THE CAR. THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT WERE NOTIFIED OF THE SITUATION. CSX HAZMAT PERSONNEL ALONG WITH MEMBERS OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ENTERED THE AREA OF THE CAR AND OPENED THE VALVE CONTROL BOX. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE 1/4"" PIPE LEADING FROM THE TANK TO THE ""LIQUID SAMPLE VALVE"" HAD COME LOOSE FROM THE PIPE NIPPLE ON THE INLET SIDE OF THE VALVE. AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO STOP THE LEAK USING A ""FREEZE PATCH"". THE FLOW OF LIQUID ETHYLENE WAS REDUCED, BUT NOT STOPPED USING THIS METHOD. A SECOND ENTRY WAS MADE TO SECURE THE LEAK. ON THE SECOND ENTRY A ""PIPE SHUT-OFF CLAMP"" WAS APPLIED TO THE LEAKING LINE. THIS CLAMP EFFECTIVELY SHUT OFF THE FLOW OF LIQUID FROM THE PIPE. AFTER INSPECTING THE CAR, THE CAR WAS MOVED INTO THE YARD AND ONTO A REPAIR TRACK. AN EMPTY TANK CAR WAS BROUGHT TO THE YARD AND THE CONTENTS OF APHX 2014 WERE TRANSFERRED INTO APHX 2010.
