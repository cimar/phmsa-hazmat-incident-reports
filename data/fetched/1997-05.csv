WAS CONTACTED BY JESSOP STEEL, WASHINGTON PA, TO LOAD AND TRANSPORT SPEND SULFURIC ACID WASTE FROM THEIR FACILITY TO MILL SERVICE, YUKON PA FOR DISPOSAL ON 5-28-97. AFTER THE TRAILER HAD BEEN TOP LOADED AT JESSOP STEEL, THE MEI DRIVER HAD SECURED THE REAR MANHOLE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF THE PENNSYLVANIA HAZARDOUS WASTE MANIFEST, PROCEEDED ON THE 38 MILE TRIP TO MILL SERVICE. SHORTLY UPON ARRIVAL AT MILL SERVICE, MARK PENSKA, THE HOST MUNICIPALITY INSPECTOR FOR MILL SERVICE HAD NOTIFIED MILL SERVICE PERSONNEL AND PENNSYLVANIA DEP THAT THERE WAS A SPILL ON THE ROAD BEFORE ENTERING THE PLANT. WE WERE NOTIFIED BY MILL SERVICE THAT ONE OF OUR TRAILERS HAD SPILLED ACID ON THE ROAD AT ABOUT 5:00 PM AND WE PROCEED TO MOBILIZE PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT TO CLEAN-UP WAS COMPLETED BY 9:30 PM ON THAT SAME DAY. UPON INVESTIGATION OF THE TRAILER, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE SPILLAGE HAD COME FROM THE REAR MANHOLE CONTAINMENT AREA. AFTER PERFORMING TIGHTNESS AND PRESSURE TESTS ON THE TRAILER, NO MECHANICAL DEFECTS HAD BEEN FOUND ON THE TRAILER. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A ONE INCH PRESSURE RELEASE VALVE HAD BEEN LEFT OPEN, OR PARTIALLY OPENED, ALLOWING ACID TO SPILL INTO HIS REAR CONTAINMENT AREA AND FROM THERE, ONTO THE GROUND THROUGH THE TWO DRAINAGE TUBES COMING FROM THE CONTAINMENT AREA. BECAUSE THE LIQUID LEVEL OF THE LOAD BEING TRANSPORTED IN THE TRAILER WAS DOWN APPROXIMATELY 12"", SPILLAGE OCCURRED ONLY AS THE TRAILER WAS ASCENDING HILLS. BY RECOMMENDATION OF THE PA DEP, ADDITIONAL CLEAN-UP HAD TAKEN PLACE AT THE SITE WITH A POWER SWEEPING BROOM/VACUUM UNIT ON 6-4-97. UPON INVESTIGATION OF THE ROADWAY NEAR THE JESSOP STEEL PLANT, WE FOUND SOME MINOR ADDITIONAL SPILLAGE WHICH WAS CLEANED-UP WITH THIS POWER BROOM ON 6-10-97. AS AN ACTION TO PREVENT FUTURE INCIDENTS OF THIS NATURE, THE PRESSURE RELEASE LINE, COMING FROM THE VALVE, WAS CAPPED-OFF. ALSO, THE DRAIN LINES FROM THE REAR MANHOLE CONTAINMENT AREA WILL BE CONNECTED TOGETHER AND A VALVE INSERTED WHICH WILL BE CLOSED DURING TRANSPORTATION. THIS WOULD CONTAIN ANY MINOR SPILLAGE IN THE CONTAINMENT AREA AND PREVENT IT FROM ENTERING THE ROADWAY.",,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1500,,US,

ACCORDING TO PERFECTION, THEIR RECORDS INDICATED THAT BETWEEN THE TWO TANKS THEY HAD 21,000 GALLONS ALREADY IN THEM AND SO THE ADDITIONAL 8,500 GALLONS WOULD BRING THEIR TANKS TO A CAPACITY OF 29,500 GALLONS.  HOWEVER ABOUT 40 MINUTES INTO OUR DRIVER UNLOADING HE NOTICED FUEL GATHERING AROUND HIS FEET.  HE THEN WENT AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS TRUCK AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS FUEL COMING OVER THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TANKS THAT HE WAS PUMPING INTO.  HE QUICKLY SHUT DOWN HIS UNIT AND ADVISED THE OFFICE PERSONNEL AT PERFECTION OIL CO.  THE PLANT MANAGER, JOHN KRITZ, GOT INTO HIS TRUCK AND DROVE AROUND BACK TO SEE IF THE VALVE TO THE STORM SEWER WAS SHUT AND WHEN HE JUMPED OUT OF HIS TRUCK HE RUPTURED THE TENDONS IN HIS LEG.  HE WAS ABLE TO HOBBLE DOWN TO SHUT OFF THE VALVE, HOWEVER HE COULD TELL THAT FUEL HAD GOTTEN INTO THE STORM DRAIN.

NICK THEN PLACED A CALL TO ME, TIM VAUGHN, SAFETY DIRECTOR, AND RELAYED THAT WE HAD A LEAKING TANK BUT HAD STOPPED THE LEAK AND THE TRUCK WAS HEADED TO OUR LOST HILLS YARD TO UNLOAD INTO A POLY TANK THAT WOULD BE DELIVERED THERE FOR THAT PURPOSE.  A SHORT TIME LATER I RECEIVED A SECOND CALL FROM NICK SAYING THAT TOM HAD BEEN CONTACTED BY THE TAFT POLICE DEPARTMENT RELATING THAT A TRUCK HAD SPILLED SOMETHING ON THE ROAD AND WANTED TO KNOW IF IT WAS ONE OF OURS.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE POLICE AND ASKED THEM ABOUT THE SITUATION WHILE NICK CALLED THE DRIVER DIRECTLY FOR A FIRST-HAND REPORT. WHEN NICK VERIFIED TO THAT THE SPILL WAS OURS I AGAIN CALLED THE POLICE AND TOLD THEM THAT THE SPILL WAS FROM OUT TRUCK AND THAT IT WAS HYDROCHLORIC ACID SOLUTION.  I IN TURN CALLED ACTI (ADVANCED CLEANUP TECHNOLOGIES, INC.), REQUESTED A HAZMAT CREW AND HEADED TO TAFT TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION. AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE TAFT FIRE DEPARTMENT AND DAN STARKEY WITH KERN COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALED SERVICES AT THE SCENE, I LEFT FOR OUR LOST HILLS YARD TO MEET WITH THE DRIVER WHERE I WAS INFORMED THAT THE REMAINDER OF THE LOAD, APPROXIMATELY 2,495 GALLONS, HAD SPILLED ONTO THE GROUND IN OUR YARD BEFORE IT COULD TRANSFERRED TO THE POLY TANK.  I THEN CALLED THE ACTI AND SPOKE WITH ROBERT, ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES WORKING AT THE SPILL SITE IN TAFT AND ASKED HIM TO RELAY TO DAN STARKEY OF THE ADDITIONAL SPILL..  I THEN IMMEDIATELY CALLED CALPI, INC., REQUESTING THAT THEY CLEAN UP THE SPILL AT OUR LOST HILLS YARD.",,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5591,,US,
