The jerricans were stacked one on top of the other and appear to be made for stacking as each container has 4 small raised locations on the top that fits into the bottom of a jerrican stacked on top of it. One jerrican was found leaking from one of the 4 raised locations on the top. It appears that the bottom can rubbed against the can stacked on top of it during transit rubbing a small hole into the jerrican.     The terminal that found the spill actually smelled the material and contacted ABF Safety & Security. We contacted the shipper and got directions on handling the product. The single leaking container was separated from the other containers, the shipper sent another container for the damaged product to be placed in. The damaged product was sent back to the shipper.",The container may have failed from either being a defective container or by the bouncing and vibration that occurs during transportation on a trailer.

Damage to bobtail resulted in hose connection to meter vapor eliminator being broken off and product leaked out. Unfortunetely an off-duty fireman that assisted the driver out of the vehicle moved the driver away from the vehicle and would not allow the driver to go back and secure the valve that controlled the breached piping.  If the driver had been allowed to do as he was trained immediately following the accident the leakage would have been eliminated.  The situation would have also been controlled quicker if the local fire and police officials would have allowed company personnel to get to the vehicle in a timely fashion, since they were more familiar with the equipment and how to cut-off the flow of product to the area that was damaged.  The company representative was allowed to eventually get to the vehicle about 2 hours after the incident and was allowed to instruct fire personnel how to cut-off the flow of materials.  If this had of been allowed immediately the situation would have been mitigated quickly and the evacuation of the local residence would not have been necessary.","We have talked with all company drivers on how to react if they accidentally go of the road surface to try and prevent over-correction leading to loss of control of vehicles. Discussed with drivers the events of the accident and reminded them on importance of cutting off product flow at tank valve.     Would also recommend that local emergency response personnel be trained on the importance of allowing the company personnel to assist in controlling the situation since in most cases they are the subject matter expert both with the risks of the product and how the equipment operates.  This must be done immediately to help mitigate the situation. We understand the importance of the emergency responders in taking charge of the situation, but they must allow the company personnel to assist.  In this case something that could have been controlled in less than an hour took almost 7 hours.",Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,21030,"A & B Propane, Inc",US,

Vehicle then left road surface, falling from the bridge onto Old Pulaski Rd below, approximately a 25ft. fall.  Vehicle slid off road below overturning and catching fire due to rupture of the diesel fuel tank at initial point of impact.  Tractor burned completely causing fatal injuries to the driver.  Cargo tank had small puntcture in sidewall  close to heads due to impact with guardrail and was venting gaseous oxygen.    Cargo tank was lifted and placed on a flatbed trailer and taken approximaely 75 yardes to a local gravel pit where it remained under supervision to allow the remaining product to vent off prior to removal to a wrecking yard. Venting of the product to atmosphere took approximately 2 days to accomplish due to the piping at the rear fo the trailer being inoperable due to impact with road surface.","Initial indications are that the accident may be fatigue related.  The driver was well within his hours of service limitations and and had only been on duty approximately 7 hours when the accident ocurred.  We have implemented a pilot test program with lane guidance and departure warning sytsems and have installed these and rollover/stability braking systems in test vehicles for evaluation purposes.    The cargo tank itself performed admirably as the impact to the road surface below did not actually cause the releas of product, impact with the guard rail caused the punture of the inner and outer shells of the cargo tank.

The Port Authority responded to the scene to contain the free product.  The Port Authority swept up the free product and placed it into 3, overpack drums.  The Port Authority placed plastic over the shipment.  H.M.H.T.T.C. of Elizabeth, New Jersey was contacted to perform the cleanup.  Upon investigation by H.M.H.T.T.C., it was determined that 12, 25 kilogram bags were leaking.  The release was due to the product leaking from the seams of the bag.  H.M.H.T.T.C. performed the cleanup using Level C protection.  H.M.H.T.T.C. placed the 12 leaking 25 kilogram bags into 2, 55 gallon recovery drums which was left at the facility to be returned to the shipper.  The remainder of the shipment was shrink-wrapped to a pallet and was also held pending shipper instructions.  No injuries or exposures were reported.

He set his preset for 100 gallons and connected his scully to the tank and made the delivery. Once the preset shut off, he left scully attached and went and checked his meter. It showed 97 gallons had been delivered. He then returned to the tank and pumped three more gallons in for a total of 100 gallons. With the scully still attached to the tank, he went to front door of the trailer and collected. a check for the delivery. He then proceeded directly to the truck cab and drove four places down the road to make his next delivery. The hose continued to reel out, pulling the horizontal tank off its blocks and bending lwo legs underneath. No leakage occurred at the tank. The hose finally separated from the hose reel causing kerosene from the hose to spill on the street. It is estimated that 20 gallons was lost from the hose. Upon arrival at 20 Gary Street, driver left truck and went to residence to collect $280.13 cash prior to making the delivery. He then walked di:rectly to the meter at the rear of the truck with cash in hand and a ticket for the customer. He placed ticket in meter and charged his line. He dumped 12.5 gallons over himself and onto the ground before he was able to shut the pump down. Based on interviews with the driver by District Manager and Branch Manager, the driver denies ever hearing the hose break away or noticing that the hose was missing. Driver immediately reported spill to Branch Manager via cellphone and requested all available assistance for a major spill.","How could Spill/Leak have been prevented: This spill was the result of driver inattention and failure to follow standard procedures. Under no circumstances should a driver walk away from a scully attached to the fill. As soon as the preset shut off, he should have disconnected and returned the scully to the truck. If the requested amount was not delivered than he could return to the tank and pump the additional amount or the billing could be adjusted if the check was not already written. If there was a consistent underpump with the preset, he could have set it for 103 gallons.

ONCE JORDAN RAN OUT OF ROOM TO MANEUVER IN THE FAR SW CORNER, (THE MIDDLE OF THE SECTION) HE EVACUATED FROM THE TRACTOR CAB AND RAN BACK TO THE NORTH NORTHEAST TOWARDS BUTLER ROAD. JORDAN COMMENTED THAT AFTER HE WAS OUT OF THE CAB, THE WIND WAS VERY LIGHT, AND IF ANY AT ALL, IT WAS OUT OF THE NORTHWEST. THE SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT BEGAN TO ARRIVE SHORTLY AFTER 6:00PM. UPON THE ARRIVAL OF THE SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT, THE OFFICIALS TOLD JORDAN TO REMAIN AT A SAFE DISTANCE.  AT 6:30, LELAND RECEIVED A CALL AT HOME FROM THE BUTLER COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT CONCERNING A LEAKING ANHYDROUS TANK. THEY ASKED HIM TO GO TO 40TH AND BUTLER ROAD. WHEN HE GOT THERE, THE BENTON FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD THE WHOLE SECTION BLOCKED. HE PROCEEDED TO THE STATE TROOPER THAT WAS BLOCKING OFF BUTLER ROAD AND TOLD HIM WHO HE WAS AND THE TROOPER TOLD HIM TO PROCEED DOWN THE DITCH AND FIND THE BENTON FIRE CHIEF. WHEN LELAND GOT TO THE SCENE, NO ONE HAD YET APPROACHED THE TANK TO SEE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE. FIRE CHIEF REX STEPHENS ASKED LELAND IF HE WOULD ASSIST HIM AND GO TO THE TANK AND SEE IF THEY COULD SHUT IT OFF. WHEN THEY GOT WITHIN 40 FEET OF THE TANK, IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO APPROACH THE TANK TO TURN OFF THE VALVE. AT THAT TIME, THEY MOVED AWAY TO A SAFER POSITION AND REASSESSED THE SITUATION. UPON REASSESSMENT, THE TANK WAS BEGINNING TO SLOW DOWN IN LIQUID RELEASE SO CHIEF STEPHENS CALLED IN A FIRE TRUCK TO LAY DOWN A WATER MIST, HE SUITED INTO SCBA GEAR AND APPROACHED THE TANK AND SHUT OFF THE VALVE. BY THE TIME THE VALVE HAD BEEN CLOSED, LITTLE OR NO LIQUID WAS ESCAPING, MOSTLY VAPOR WAS BEING RELEASED. THE AREA WAS ALLOWED TO AIR FOR SOME TIME AND THEN BRUCE PENNER WAS ALLOWED TO RETURN TO HIS ANHYDROUS APPLICATION.

Following discussions with Mr. Robert Shepard of CDG and Rome Oil Company, CDG was contracted to manage the environmental aspects, including the contaminated soil removal and disposal, at the accident site.   COG responded to the accident site equipped with an assortment of absorbent materials to assist in the containment of any free product.   Upon arrival at the site the Home Oil Company transport vehicle had been off loaded of all remaining product. The damaged vehicle had been up righted and removed from the accident site.   Upon arrival COG personnel met with Mr. Jerry Cheatwood with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and conducted a full evaluation of the accident / release site. It was reported to COG by Mr. Cheatwood that the accident resulted in a release of approximately 300-350 gallons of diesel fuel. COG was advised the Alabama Department of Trunsportation (ALDOT) road crews had been on site and utilized sand spread within the area to assist in absorbing free product. CDG and AIJEM determined that an excavation area approximately 40’ x 12’ would be needed to remove the contaminated soil from the site. It was also determined that the right-of-way along Hwy 110 contained water mains and fiber optic cables that ran the complete length of the needed excavation area. Service personnel were notified of this situation and responded to the site to assist with locating all utilities in the identified excavation area prior to the soil removal process.   CDG contracted with McDonald Construction of Union Springs Alabama to assist with the contaminated soil removal and transport for disposal. Mr. Jimmy McDonald responded with crews arriving on site at approximately 12:30 PM. McDonald Construction assisted COG with one John Deere 135C excavator and three 20 cubic yard dump trucks to remove the diesel fuel contaminated soils.   Two loads, approximately 42 cubic yards, of contaminated soil were excavated from the spill area. This contaminated soil was transported by McDonald Construction to Tallassee Waste Disposal, Inc. (Sunflower Landfill Permit 462-i 1R) for disposal.   Prior to transportation and disposal of the contaminated soil, emergency approval from ADEM had been obtained by COG for disposal. During the transportation process each vehicle was given a completed Manifest for Non-Hazardous Special Waste before leaving the spill site. Copies of the manifest are included in this report.  Following the excavation of the contaminated soil from the site, CDG obtained confirmation PAR samples from within the excavation.
