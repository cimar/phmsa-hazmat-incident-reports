AS THE CONTAINER WAS PLACARDED FLAMMABLE, THE AREA WAS SECURED AND THE CONTAINER ISOLATED PENDING INSPECTION.  MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE ICTF RAMP, LOCATED THE ABOVE CONTAINER IN SPACE #89, AND OBSERVED A SMALL AMOUNT OF LIQUID (LESS THAN ONE GALLON) POOLED ON THE PAVEMENT TO THE REAR OF THE CHASSIS. THE LEAKING PRODUCT APPEARED TO HAVE SUBSIDED.  THE GROUND SPILL AREA WAS COVERED WITH ABSORBENT AND THE RESIDUE REMOVED.  THE CONTAINER WAS MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK FOR INSPECTION.  THE SECURITY SEAL, PETROLITE 5069, WAS REMOVED AND THE REAR DOORS OPENED TO INSPECT THE LADING.  THE 20 FOOT CONTAINER HAD 55 GALLON METAL DRUMS, DOUBLE STACKED THROUGHOUT.  THE DRUMS WERE SECURED WITH STRIPS OF TY-PATCH MATERIAL AND METAL BANDING, BOTH OF WHICH WERE LOOSE.  IN ORDER TO LOCATE THE LEAKING DRUM, THE CONTENTS REQUIRED OFF LOADING.  DURING THE OFF LOADING PROCESS, LOCATED A SINGLE DRUM AGAINST THE RIGHT SIDEWALL, BOTTOM LAYER, 2 ROWS IN FROM THE REAR DOORS, THAT WAS LEAKING FROM THE SIDE BELOW THE LOWER ROLLING HOOP.  THE STEEL BANDING USED TO SECURE THE LOAD HAD BEEN FOLDED OVER, CREATING CRIMP IN THE BANDING, WHICH CUT THROUGH THE SIDEWALL OF THE DRUM. APPROXIMATELY 15 GALLONS OF THE PRODUCT HAD ALSO BEEN FOLDED OVER, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE CRIMP WAS AGAINST THE BOTTOM ROLLING HOOP, THE DRUM DID NOT FAIL.  THE DRUM DID SUSTAIN HEAVY DAMAGE TO THE ROLLING HOOP FROM THE BANDING ABRADING AGAINST IT AND WAS DEEMED UNFIT FOR FURTHER TRANSPORT.  AS THE LIQUID FROM THE LEAKING DRUM HAD MOVED FORWARD INTO THE CONTAINER, THE REMAINING DRUMS WERE REMOVED.  THE FLOOR WAS DECONTAMINATED PER THE MANUFACTURERS RECOMMENDATIONS, AND THE LADING REINSTALLED IN THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER. THE LADING WAS PROPERLY SECURED AND RELEASED FOR MOVEMENT ONTO THE CONSIGNEE.  THE 2 DAMAGED DRUMS ARE BEING RETURNED TO THE SHIPPER PER THE MANUFACTURERS REQUEST.
