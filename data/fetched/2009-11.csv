A BNSF Mechanical/Hazardous Material responder inspected LTCX 1610 and reported that the vent source was from a closed valve within the side equipment control cabinet. The shipper/consignee was contacted and sent a technician responder to end the vapor release. The technician bled down the internal pressure that had built-up within LTCX 1610 which essentially ended the vapor vent. The closed main fill valve was reported as the leak source and appeared to be leaking at the valve stem area. This fill valve possibly was over tightened resulting in damage to the valve stem packing material. The packing was adjusted with additional packing applied. This valve was earmarked for replacement by the shipper technician. After monitoring, no further vapor vent was evident. Response was concluded by approximately 1500 hrs.

DBUX 300059 was carefully setout of the train and isolated in the railyard. BNSF and contract hazardous material responders inspected DBUX 300059 and reported finding the bottom operated bottom outlet valve (BOV) in its closed position with its operating handle pinned. The BOC was tool tight. The BOC was carefully removed for gasket inspection. Inside the BOC, two BOC gaskets were found, with one of these deteriorated; and a build-up of fuel oil sludge. The BOC was cleaned, along with the remaining serviceable gasket. Teflon tape was applied to the BOC threads. The BOC was reapplied and properly tool tightened. Afterwards, no further residue product drips were observed during the monitoring period. The BOV was tagged for inspection/repair since product appeared to be by-passing the closed valve. DBUX 300059 was directed to a repair facility. The residue product that impacted the ground which appeared to be accompanied with water was treated with a bio-treatment agent. DBUX 300059 has been top loaded/unloaded in its previous transport cycles, and any water or moisture inside the tank migrated to the tank bottom. Response was concluded by 1330 hrs.

He notified myself to report a possible spill. I had  him go get rubber gloves, salvage drum and paper towel as at first glance looked as if the cap on the jugs were not tightened fully. Upon further investigation the caps were sealed and the one jug that was wet on top's cap was tightened fully as well. I lifted the jug and it appeared to be half empty with no sign of damage to the jug itself. I went back to the trailer from which it was unloaded, 313-6086 and, didn't see any sign of leaking in the trailer. Going back to the skid I carefully looked at the skid to determine if it had been leaking for a long time or not. The skid was indeed wet but not saturated. I placed the half empty jug in a five gallon salvage drum sealed the drum and sent the rest of the freight out for delivery. I contacted Safety and told him the situation. The customer, Quaker Chemical refused the entire order do to the palette being wet and some residue on on lid on the bottom of skid.

The driver took a stick reading at the tank and showed just under 60 inches, the veeder root reading showed 58.78 inches. The driver should have been able to fit 1584 gallons. While unloading the driver felt the hose jump at which time the hose disconnected, leaking approximately 10-15 gallons onto the concrete, driver immediately shut off the flow of product. Most of the spill was contained but it was estimated that 1/2 of a gallon may have reached the drainage area. The spill was cleaned up with 120 lbs of absorbant and SWS First Response was called to the scene. SWS inspected and ensured the clean up was done satisfactorily. The spill occured after 1122 gallons had been dropped. There should have been no problem fitting more gas into the tank but due to the hose not being properly tightened the pressure of the gas not fitting and the loose closure caused the leak to occur.",The driver was counseled on the unloading procedure and not only is a visual inspection of hose/fittings/couplings required but a driver must double check the setting is secure by tugging on the drop tube.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Florida Rock and Tank Lines,US,

During the loading process, the driver maintained line fo site with the vehicles load level indicator.  as he neared the maximum capacity on the tank he suspended the loading operation to insure he did not overfill the tank.  Once the transfer operation was complete, the driver began to break down the transfer lines and clearing any residual material into the tank.  During this operation, he noticed that material began to leak from the vent device associated with the pump unit.  The driver immediately secured both the external and internal valves to minimize the relesae.  The driver, along with the shipper's represnetative proceeded to absorb the free lquid that escaped from the vent.  This material was placed into a suitable container and was placed into storage pending off site disposal.","In order to prevent a recurrence, the driver will be retrained in the operating procedures for the tank in question..  AN emphasis will be plced on propoer inspection of the tank before, during and at the conclusion of the loading operation to insure the tank is filled to a point in which sufficient space is left for expansion.  IN addition, a visual check must be done to confirm that the liquid level gauge is accurate as it was evident that the driver loaded more material than the level gauge indicated.

This valve is a block valve and not a valve that is used during the loading nor the unloading process. The valve is there to be used in case of a catastrophic event such as a fire, so the contents of the trailer can be shut off completely at the tank outlet, so the oxygen doesn't enhance the combustion process. Drivers have also been given remedial training on inspecting this valve during their pre and post trip inspections.

The crash caused about 30 pounds of anhydrous ammonia to be released into the atmosphere from a safety relief valve on the trailer before the valve reseated itself, causing the leak to stop. About 75 people from the Eastern edge of Big Stone City, SD. were evacuated as a precaution due to the uncertainity of the integrity of the valve. The anhydrous ammonia was trasnferred from the overturned trailer into a different trailer before uprighting the overturned unit. No additional anhydrous ammonia was released.

Due to the degree of slope, the tractor/trailer rolled over and came to rest on the right hand side of the road shoulder and was completely off the traveled portion of the roadway. The Scott County KY Emergency Response department was called and they responded to the accident scene. This was a single vehicle accident and the driver was unhurt. The cargo was trickling from the tank trailer for about 6 hours. The Emergency Response crew put a dike around the area affected by the leak. Immediate action was taken to locate a replacement tank trailer. During the transfer an estimated 800 gallons was spilled on the ground as the cargo was transferred to another tank trailer.

CHVX 100113 was cordoned off and activities in the railyard were suspended. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected CHVX 100113 finding the B-end liquid valve had frost formed around its closure plug. The responder reported that the wheel valve appeared closed but was able to turn it slightly to its fully closed position and the audible escaping vapor hiss ceased. The B-end liquid valve's closure plug was tight and again the responder was able to turn it to a tool tight condition. Afterwards, BNSF contract responders arrived and proceeded to recheck all valves and fittings. The B-end liquid valve's closure plug was removed, cleaned, Teflon taped, reapplied and tool tightened. Response was concluded by 0340 hrs. CST, 11/12/09.

The container flooring was covered with plastic sheeting that had absorbent pads covering the plastic sheeting.   Blocking and bracing consisted of improperly applied Ty-Guard that was less than adequate to properly restrain the lading.  Located two open top 55-gallon drums of paint that were leaking at the bungs due to improper securement. A total of four gallons was released.

The top rolling hoop was abraded by an adjacent drum rolling hoop.  Approximately 15 gallons of product was released.  This drum should have been placed in a salvage drum for shipment.  The leaking drum was patched and placed into salvage drum for securement.  Several other drums sustained sufficient damage, but did not leak, that required they be placed into salvage drums to continue in transit.

The cause of this derailment was attributed to a switch malfunction and improper use of this power switch. One of the railcars derailed was TILX 314693 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) that derailed leaning with its trucks out from under this tank car. TILX 314693's bottom outlet valve (BOV) was sheared off up to the flange connection from impact with the ground, exposing the internal ball in this valve. A slight product drip emanated from around the BOV's internal ball seal. BNSF responders and contract responders placed containment under the BOV to catch the drips. TILX 314693 was rerailed and staged for product transfer with containment in place under the damaged BOV. Product within TILX 314693 was transferred into another suitable tank car on 12/02/09 without further incident. Product that was captured in the containment receptacle evaporated.

(A•C•T) Project Manager, Mr. Wayne Koszegi, CHMM to request assistance with a toluene spill and product transfer. The spill occurred at the Lee Hi Travel Plaza located at 2516 North Lee Road (I-81, Exit 195) in Lexington, Virginia.  Ms. LeBlanc advised that a weld cracked on tanker #8654 and less than 5-gallon of toluene was released onto the asphalt parking lot and that the load would have to be transferred to another tanker. Mr. Koszegi contacted Mr. Keith Thorton, the Quality Carriers driver to determine if any stormwater drains or soil were impacted.  Mr. Thorton reported that no drains or soil were impacted.  The VA-DEQ was notified of this incident and report #HMVA 5988 was issued.        Upon arrival at the site, our response team advised that the Lexington Fire Department had closed the truck stop and placed fire hose across a highway closing it in both directions.  The fire chief would not let our responders enter the “hot zone” until the fire chief determined it was safe.  Multiple fire hose lines were placed in the area by the fire dept as a precaution.  Ms. LeBlanc advised that a clean tanker was en route to the site.  The regional hazardous material response team (haz-mat) was mobilized to the site at the direction of the local fire chief.  Upon arrival, the haz-mat team investigated the area and established air monitoring stations.      Once the fire chief allowed our response team to make entry to the tanker, absorbent pads and boom was applied to a small area of contamination on the asphalt.      The clean tanker arrived on site at 0500 hours local time and product transfer operations began.  The product transfer was concluded at approximately 0745 hours local time.  All contaminated pads and boom were collected and containerized into a 55-gallon drum for disposal.      All fire department hose lines were removed from the highway at approximately 0800 hours local time and the truck stop was re-opened.

(A•C•T) Project Manager, Mr. Wayne Koszegi, CHMM to request assistance with a spill of Furfuryl Alcohol Urea Formaldehyde Polymer Resin.  The spill occurred on the United States side of the Peace Bride in Buffalo, New York. Ms. Budd advised that the product was leaking from the washout cap and was mostly contained on the tanker sides and a small area on the pavement. Mr. Koszegi contacted Officer Deacon from the U.S. Customs Service who confirmed the initial reports.  No soil or waterways were impacted.  Officer Deacon also advised that the NY-DEC was notified of this incident.    Upon arrival at the site, our response team advised that the impacted area was contained on the asphalt roadway and a small section of the tanker.  No soil or waterways were impacted shown in the Maps and Photographs section of this report.     Our response team began the cleanup process by applying granular sorbents to the spilled material located on the paved surfaces surrounding the trailer.  The tanker side was scraped to remove the resin.  All waste was containerized into one (1) 55-gallons drum for disposal.  Officer Deacon approved the cleanup operations and released the truck to continue on its route.

WEISS,NATIONWIDE PROJECT MANAGER,1875 West Main Street,Bartow,FL,33830,Other-Pvt Cleanup Management C,"On Thursday, November 12, 2009, at 1415 hours EST, Ms. Kathy Cronin, from Quality Carriers contacted American Compliance Technologies, Inc. (A•C•T) Nationwide Project Manager, Mr. Gary L. Weiss to request assistance with the transload of a corrosive chemical. The incident location is at a Quality Carriers Facility at 1251 Battle Creek Road in Jonesboro, Georgia.  Ms. Cronin advised that tanker #69320 developed a valve problem that required the chemical to be transloaded into another tanker.  Additionally, a nitrogen blanked would have to be applied to the new tanker during the transload process.  Quality Carriers advised that they would supply the clean tanker and nitrogen gas for site activities.      The product that needed to be transloaded was Vestamin IPD (Isophoron Diamine) a colorless corrosive liquid with a UN 1040 marking.   A•C•T reviewed the MSDS and all safety precautions with our response team prior to any site operations.    Upon arrival at the site, our response team met with Mr. Mark Bryan, the Operations Supervisor and inspected the leaking tanker.  The tanker had a capacity of 6,000 gallons of product and Quality Carriers personnel had stopped the leak. Due to the fact that it was a bottom valve that was compromised, as shown in Figure 2 of the Maps and Photographs section of this report, our response team was unable to pressurize the vessel to blow the product over because the valve might sheer off due to any surge.    After consulting with Mr. Rob Smale, from Quality Distribution it was decided to return in the morning and use a the Quality Carrier Tanker pump to transload the product      On Friday, November 13, 2009, our response team returned to the site to complete all operations.  Once the Quality Carriers tanker arrived, it was determined that it was not large enough to hold the entire load.  A different tanker was requested.  Once the second tanker arrived our response team established a closed loop transfer system utilizing hoses provided by Quality carrier to transload the product.  A six (6) PSI blanket of nitrogen was placed in the tanker to complete the transload operation.    WASTE DISPOSAL    As a result of the response activities, one (1) drum of approximately 5 gallons of product, PPE and boom was left onsite per Mr. Smale.

Immediately after the page Sergeant Linton advised Thayer   County Dispatch that he and Trooper Schropfer would be in route to the scene. Sergeant Linton then called Trooper Schropfer on the radio to ensure he had heard the page and was in route. Trooper Schropfer advised that he had heard and was in route. At the time there was a very thick fog in the area which can be seen by the responding officers in car cameras. The responding officers observed the fog the entire time that they were in route including at the scene of the crash.     Sergeant Linton was the first to arrive on the scene. He advised that it was at the north junction of Highways 4 and 81. He also advised there were two trucks and a car involved. One of the trucks was displaying red placards with an identification number of 1075. 1075 is the United Nations identification number for Propane.     At approximately 0814 Trooper Schropfer arrived on the scene. As he arrived he asked Lincoln Dispatch to have more people in route to help control traffic because he observed that the fog was still very thick. Trooper Schropfer estimated the visibility at the time to be approximately 200 feet. He also observed that one of the trucks involved had been pulling a cargo tank which was marked indicating that it was carrying propane. The other truck involved had stopped with its cab under the propane trailer, and the car involved had had ran into the front   bumper of the first truck (see accident report and diagram indicating final rest of vehicles).     After Trooper Schropfer exited his vehicle it was discovered that there was a small propane leak on the rear of the cargo tank. It appeared to be coming from the packing around one of the hand valves for the rear outlets. Trooper Schropfer was contacted by Joel L Voss who indicated that he had been driving the truck pulling the cargo tank. Voss stated that he had looked at the cargo tank, and that was the only leak he had observed. It was determined that the emergency shut off on the tank was closed so that after the propane leaked out of that pipe it should stop leaking. Trooper Schropfer made the decision that they would let It leak, and just keep the immediate area clear of ignition sources. At this time Trooper Schropfer cut the battery cables for the truck under the propane trailer. The battery cables for the truck pulling the propane trailer were also disconnected. Trooper Schropfer also made the decision to not attempt to extricate the driver of the second truck, which was a Volvo, because of the risk of creating an ignition source around the propane leak. Based on the amount of damage to, and the where the cab was at final rest Trooper Schropfer determined that It was probab",NO COMMENT PROVIDED.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,51401,LICHTI BROS OIL CO INC,US,
