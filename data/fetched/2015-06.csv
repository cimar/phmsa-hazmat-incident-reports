He had been pumping for about 45 minutes when the hose attached to the pump outlet developed a 5” split in it about 5” from the connector.  Driver was on the other side of the trailer with the plant rep checking sight gauge when he heard the noise.  He immediately ran around and shut down.  The spill went in a containment area with a drain to their waste water system.  They hosed the area down.  The driver said that they were getting their spill team out     He said the one that burst was new in October when he got his new truck.  He said it looked okay when he hooked it up.   Chemtrec report #20150601-00104.,"We have very few hose failures happen.  Most often we find that hoses split or rupture, especially between 3-10"" from the end of thse hose,  due to tankwash facilities sticking hose cleaning wands inside the hose to clean it out.  The ends of the wands are sharp, pressurized, and rub directly on the hose lining.  Due to the fact that not all hoses are used on every load it makes it very difficult to trace back the guilty tankwash party.  However our tankwash director is mentioning this on his weekly tankwash call so that they implement hose blocks/restrictors from going into the hoses or another process to avoid this from happening.  We are also reviewing with the driver to ensure he looks inside the end of each hose very closely.  Although its not easy to see in the hose very far.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1500,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

He stated that they got some on their skin and some in the mouth.  I asked if they had any water or berage on site that they could use to rinse their mouths out (careful not to swallow) and rinse their skin.  He stated they did not.  I promptly emailed him the SDS and advised against having them drive after being exposed to a chemical and to have them call 911.  In the interests of time and safety for his family I asked him to hang up and get 911 dispatched and to call me back so we could get the next pieces in motion.      The caller was not on site with his family.  I will note that he seemed unusually calm and patient during the phone call when there was an unknown product on his family.  He never did call back in but our accident department reached out to them via the email address I sent the SDS over to.  They did respond back today that they are claiming to have respiratory issues.  We’re not sure yet the extent of the medical issues and whether any medical treatment was obtained that day at my recommendation.      When the incident occurred I reached out to the driver immediately following the conversation with the initial caller.  I was able to confirm that he was pulled over dealing with it and that it was a washout cap that had come off.  He was less than 2 miles from the shipper.  Nothing was on the ground but there was product on the side of his trailer.  He secured a new washout cap on the trailer and headed back to the tankwash to have the exterior cleaned off.,The action taken was that we let the driver go.  He stated that when he pre-tripped the trailer the cap seemed flush when really it must have been cross-threaded.  We had the driver on video going through his pre-trip.  He did not check the washout caps on his inspection as originally stated and is an important step that we preach heavily.  I believe this was an isolated incident and the actions taken were appropriate given the circumstances.  We will continue to train on washout cap inspection in our yearly training events using this incident as a training tool.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

They treated and released him which i don't believe counts as being admitted to the hospital so my entry on that part of the form shows a '0' for hospitalizations.      The customers hose hook up was a PVC hook up suspended 5 feet in the air.  He was using 15psi or less as he unloaded into the customer tank.  The trailer went empty and the PVC fill line started to shake (as expected as air started to come through the line).  The driver shut the valves down on our trailer.  He then opened the internal valve and the external valve about 1/4 of the way (to keep the air controlled) while he walked and cleared the lines to the customer shut off valve.  As he was walking the line the customers PVC piping snapped off and a pint of product vaporized into a mist that sprayed the driver.  Product got on his chemical suit and on his face under his face shield and into his eyes.  We require Chemical goggles, chemical suit, chemical gloves, goggles, and face shield. Driver was wearing safety glasses instead of goggles.  This is how the mist entered his eyes.  He was taken to a safety shower and then taken to the hospital as a precautionary measure.  Driver was given the all clear by the hospital to drive and the next day he is feeling fine (thankfully).  At this time we don't believe the amount of air pressure used or the processes he followed led to the snapped fill line.  We believe that the fill line was either old and deteriorated or is not in a best design capacity.","Our driver could have prevented this injury by using the proper protective gear.  In interviewing the driver it sounds as though he did not know where to look in his electronic work assignment for the correct PPE and thought that the safety glasses with side shields along with the face shield should be enough to protect him in the event of an incident.  He understands that was a bad decision and is going to spend time with our training team to ensure he understands PPE and where to find what should be used.      On the customer's fill line, our customer (shipper) is working with the consignee to determine what (if any) design changes need to be implemented.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

A response contractor was dispatched to the yard to investigate. A small leak sourcing from the pressure relief device (PRD) was detected. The release was caused from the tank car being overloaded with pressure (this car was found with 66 psi). Car is equipped with a 75 psi PRV which by specification are only vapor tight below 60 psi.  Ideally, these tank cars should not be offered into transportation with pressures exceeding 60 psi. Other industry subject matter experts indicate that 35-40 psi is their maximum. The PRV is not defective and was sealed with minor modulation of the retainer cap. A Midland kit was installed over the pressure relief device to assure the vapor tight seal.      File Note: Item 25(1) did not have a selection for human error failure, over pressurization, or any other choice that would fit this situation. The DOT parameters require a selection for this question. An arbitrary selection of ""Basic Material"" was picked to process this report. However, this package did not have a defect, and the release was caused from human error of over pressurization.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Shipper, please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the transfer operation, it was discovered that approximately 2 gallons of material had  escaped from a pinhole leak that had developed in the container. The material in the drum was pH'd.  The pH was neutral.  Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised container into a suitable salvage drum. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and placed into the salvage drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed. Drivers will continue to inspect each container during staging period as well as before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity.

The discovery was made while conducting a facility inspection.  The spill was reported to the National Response Center (“NRC”) at 11:54 am on June 15, 2015. It was reported to the North Carolina Department Environment and Natural Resources (“NCDENR”) after reporting to the NRC.  Reporting to the Mecklenburg County LEPC was not required as the spill was contained on the facility site. The spill was immediately contained at the time of discovery and no additional material was spilled.  An emergency response contractor was mobilized to the facility on June 15, 2015 to initiate response efforts.    Approximately 1,040 liters of waste chromic acid and sulfuric acid mixture that was manifested as characteristically hazardous waste was spilled onto an asphalt and concrete parking area:    • D001 Oxidizer as described at 40 CFR 261.21(a)(4)  • D002 as described at §261.22(a)(1)  • D007 as described at §261.24(a) and (b)    The waste was approved for receipt at Heritage Environmental Services, LLC in Indianapolis, Indiana, a RCRA permitted treatment storage and disposal facility, for management on waste stream 10156-51 (Attachment 1).  The waste chromic acid was generated by Apex Tool Group, LLC located in Apex, North Carolina.  Two Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBC’S) of the waste  were being transported on page 1, line 4, of Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest number 000678000WAS from Apex Tool Group, LLC in Apex, NC to Heritage Environmental Services, LLC in Indianapolis, IN (Attachment 2).  The spill notification and subsequent response was initiated as a result of a packaging failure of one of the IBCs.  The waste present in the IBC containers appeared to be incompatible with the materials of construction (HDPE).  The container was located on a Heritage Transport, LLC 53-foot van trailer at the Ten Day Transfer facility when it failed.    The area affected was central to the facility with the nearest pathway off property being a storm drain that was bermed and covered immediately upon discovery.  The spill did not reach the storm drain. There was no precipitation the day of the spill or during the clean up efforts.    The liquid remaining from the two IBCs containing the same wastestream was transferred into seven (7) 55-gallon high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) containers with 2.0mil Teflon PFA film inner liners.  The containers were then placed within HDPE over-packs. The material was returned to the generator on a Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest (Attachment 3) on June 19, 2015.     Clay absorbent material was applied to the spill to solidify.  This was swept and shoveled into containers. Acid Gator absorbent for acid spill absorption was then applied to the stained areas along with a bicarbonate solution. The Acid Gator was then broomed in and shoveled into containers.

The drum was discovered to have a pin hole leak at the side wall resulting in a release of approximately 0.5 cups of material. Facility management was notified and an in house crew responded. The response crew donned the proper PPE, over-packed the damaged drum and clean up debris into a suitable salvage drum, and secured the drum for continued transportation to the intended disposal facility. The Iowa Department of Natural resources was notified. Duty operator Gross provided report # 062315-wcg-1719.",At the time the driver accepted the container for transportation no evidence of leaking was observed. The shipper was advised of the incident and was requested to inspect all drums in current inventory for any containers with suspect integrity. The driver was re-instructed to perform a thorough inspection of all containers prior to accepting them for transportation. The shipper advised of a change in their process that may have resulted in a change of constituents in the waste disposal profile. The change in constituents resulted in corrosion of the steel drum.

It had leaked about 50 gallons before it was discovered. The product must have eaten through the valve and started to leak earlier that morning. Its hard to tell what caused the leak, because the tank had not been moved for 3 days. After initial containing the spill, it was determined that the valve was not able to fixed to stop the leak. The tank was placed into a plastic containment tarp to stop any further spill on to the pier. BEI was brought in to help transfer the product into an empty container that last contained ferric chloride.

The driver though he was suppose to unload into the east tank but it was suppose to go into the west tank. As the driver began the unloading process he noticed the tank was overfilling. He immediately shut down the unloading process. Approximately 50 gallons of caustic overflowed to secondary containment and cleaned up in house. The driver then hooked to the west tank and continued the unloading process without further incident. There were no injuries as a result of this spill.,The Trucking Supervisor met with the driver to determine why the spill occurred. The investigation revealed the driver relied on verbal instructions from the customer's receiving agent on which tank to unload into. The driver failed to require the receiving agent to physically show them the correct connection point as required on the In the Interest of Safety form.

Driver pullled into the Loves truck stop in Orangeburg, SC, drove through the fuel island and parked in the truck parking area. When driver exited the truck at approx. 0515 he noticed acid leaking from under the rear of the trailer. The leak was from a 1/4 inch hole in the bottom of the tank directly under the manway and was spilling onto the pavement. Driver contacted truck stop management and 911 emergency response. The county HAZMAT team arrived and contained the spill using containers, buoys and sand to stop the acid from running into the storm drain or the dirt. The onsite Hazmat response director, made the decision to evacuate the truck stop, including a small service station and a Waffle House located next to it. SWS Environmental arrived on scene and plugged the hole in the trailer stopping the leak. The remaining product in the trailer was pumped out into a rubber lined trailer. Approx. 1630 the truck stop and Waffle House were reopened.",The trailer was inspected after and it was determined that the liner had small defects that were not indentified by visual ispection. First step KC Industries Trucking has done is to stop transporting 50% Sulfuric Acid.

During flight after takeoff from MIA the Load Supervisor went to do a routine check of the cargo and notice that one of the tanks was releasing gas thru the valves and notify the captain.    The tanks were secure however a big cloud was notice as a result of the tanks releasing gas in the main cargo compartment and the Load Supervisor left the compartment and closed the smoke barrier ( door).     The crew called Florida West Operation and notifies them of the incident.     The captain made the decision to return to MIA and declare an emergency.    Package failure details:  We were unable to get any details on the exact way the valves work from the shipper. It seem as if the valves just started to release a lot of gas.    Duration of leak:  Duration of the leak is unknown as the door to the cargo compartment was kept closed after the spill was noticed.    Mitigating the effects:  Upon noticing the leak the main cargo compartment was isolated from the crew by keeping the smoke barrier door closed. The ICAO ERG was consulted and follow the Drill Code that was indicated on the NOTOC for the items on position 4R where the gas was notice. The captain called flight control for additional advice. The flight follower called the emergency 24 hour number provided on the shippers declaration but didn’t get any answer. Without receiving advice from the shipper the Captain made the decision to return to Miami.","The director of safety contacted the shipper to get more information on the shipment and was informed that the containers normally release some pressure. However we were not able to get any specifics on how to determine what is normal release of pressure and what is a leak of the material for a defective valve or too much pressure on the containers.    Per standard procedures, once a spill or leak is detected in the cargo compartment it is isolated and no one is permitted to re-enter to trouble shoot the problem. Our recommendation is that the shippers should better inform the carriers on the way this type of containers and valves work in order to better determine what is normal pressure release (venting) and what is hazmat spill.",No,CYLINDER,"Cylindrical metal container, not for compressed gases (i. e., not a pressure vessel)",CYL MTL,No,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Florida West International Airways,US,

The driver utilized the customer 5 gallon bucket and placed the bucket underneath the trailer and hose connection at the back of the trailer. As the driver began to unhook the hose from the customer end of the line, the bucket began to leak and caused the product to spill on the ground. Approximately two ounces were released before the driver tipped the bucket to stop the leak. The spill was immediately controlled and the area cleaned. The bucket had a small crack in the bottom that was not visible because of dried product residue on the bottom of the bucket. Trimac will supply the drivers clean new buckets to use and not rely in the customer to supply this type of containment.",The five gallon bucket is the normal containment device in case there is any product spill from uncoupling hoses.Trimac is reviewing the process trying to develop a more efficient type of containment in case there is any product heel in the hose.

Driver called me (the owner) at 5:15 a.m. before he called emergency services.  I asked if he was okay and told him to hang up and call 911 so emergency response could find him and to make sure he told them he was loaded with flammable hazardous materials.  He was not sure where he was.  I got in my car and headed in the direction where I knew he should be coming.  I received a call from Minnesota pollution control about an hour later and they informed me where the truck was and that driver had been taken to hospital.  I am still waiting on the accident report from Minnesota State Patrol.  After talking to driver later - Driver said he was on I-90 and claimed he coughed and passed out.  Drove the truck down a 250' embankment and hit a tree where truck then laid over in mud on right side.  Driver does not remember hitting tree but says he woke up on the way down.  The semi was almost upside down.  It was laying over a spring-fed creek that is the water supply for the Town of St. Charles Minnesota.  The tanker did not leak until the sun came up.  Then it only leaked out of the front compartment manhole cover.  Approximately 150 gallons was contained by the St. Charles Fire Department in containers.  Waste Central and Clean Harbors took away the spilled material.  I sent another one of my trucks to St. Charles and later in the day, holes were drilled in the wrecked tanker and we pumped the rest of the product off.  When the wrecked truck was uprighted, the diesel tank came off the passenger side and spilled some diesel.  Minnesota Pollution control tested the site for two days and no further clean-up was required for either the ethanol or the diesel fuel.",I actually can't think of anything at this time.  I feel that Minnesota Pollution Control and the St. Charles Fire Department as well as DOT and State Patrol did an excellent job in containing the situation and the professionalism was outstanding.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,259000,"RITESIDE Petroleum Transport, LLC",US,

HE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THE FLOW AND AS THE DRIVER UNHOOKED THE FITTINGS, LESS THE 2 QUARTS WAS RELEASED ONTO CONCRETE, HE CLEANED IT UP WITH AN ABSORBENT PAD. AFTER THAT TIME ALL HOSES AND FITTINGS WERE UNHOOKED AND LOADED ONTO THE TANKER. THE DRIVER ENTERED THE STORE TO TELL THEM HE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE RETAINED GALLONS TO THE STORE NEAR BY AND WOULD RETURN WITH THE DELIVERY PAPERS. AFTER HE LEFT, A CUSTOMER CALLED THE FIRE DEPT. CLAIMING FUEL CAME FORM THE BUCKET AND WAS GOING DOWN THE HILL, MOST OF THIS STORY WAS BASED ON THE SMELL OF GAS WHEN THE WITNESS WAS PUMPING GAS. THE STORE MANAGER CALLED OUR DISPATCHER WHO CALLED THE DRIVER AND HIS REGIONAL SUPERVISOR. THEY RETURNED TO THE SITE TO FIND ONLY A SHEEN ON RAIN PUDDLES AND NO FUEL IN ANY OF THE DROP BUCKETS OR STORM DRAINS. DUE TO THE WET CONCRETE, OVERFILLED TANK, SPLIT OR RETAINED LOAD AND UNRELIABLE WITNESS, THE EXACT GALLONS WERE ALL BASED ON BEST GUESS ESTIMATES. TAS ENVIRONMENTAL WAS CALLED BY STAR TO EVALUATE THE POSSIBLE SPILL. MICROBES WERE SPREAD OUT AND PADS USED. NO FUEL WAS FOUND IN STORM DRAINS, DROP BUCKETS OR CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE SOIL. THIS SHOWS US THAT EVEN THE SMALLEST GUESSES ON GALLONS LOST ARE STILL OVER STATED GREATLY.","THE PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF RELEASE, IS TO CHECK THE STICK READINGS AND COMPARE TO THE ATG BEFORE DROPPING TO VERIFY THE AMOUNT THAT CAN SAFELY FIT BEFORE THE DROP TAKES PLACE.

PACKAGE WAS CRUSHED DURING SORT OPERATIONS AT THE MEMPHIS HUB ON FRIDAY NIGHT JUNE 26 2015 AND THE TWO INNER SCRE TOP VIALS CONTAINING THREE RADIOACTIVE CAPSULES CAME OUT OF THE PACKAGE. THE PACKAGE WAS REWRAPPED AND CONTINUED TO BOSTON ARRIVING AT THE FEDEX EXPRESS BOSTON LOGAN RAMP ON SATURDAY MORNING, JUNE 27 2015. WHERE IT WAS TRUCKED TO THE FRAMINGHAM STATION AND THEN TRANSFERRED BY TRUCK TO THE WEST BOLYSTON STATION, WHERE IT REMAINED UNTIL MONDAY JUNE 29 2015 IT WAS DELIVERED TO WORCESTOR PLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE, WHO DETERMINED THE PACKAGE WAS MISSING THE RADIOACTIVE CONTENTS. FEDEX EXPRESS WAS NOTIFIED BY THE SHIPPER, SOURCE PRODUCTION AND EQUIPMENT COMPANY (SPEC) AT 1:20 PM MONDAY, JUNE 29 2015 THAT THE PACKAGE HAD BEEN DELIVERED BUT THE RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL CONTENTS WERE MISSING.    THE TWO INNER CONTAINERS WERE GLASS SCREW TOP VIALS 1.875 IN HEIGHT AND 0.63 CENTIMETER IN DIAMETER. ONE VIAL CONTAINED ONE SE-75 TITANIUM CAPSULE, 5.7 MBQ, 1 MM DIAMETER BY 5 MM LENGTH. THE SECOND VIAL CONTAINED 47.0 MBQ YB-169 TITANIUM CAPSULES, 0.8 MM DIAMETER BY 4.5 MM LENGTH  FEDEX EXPRESS INITIATED RADIATION SURVEYS AT THE MEMPHIS HUB, NEW ORLEANS RAMP, BOSTON LOGAN RAMP, FRAMINGHAM STATION, WEST BOYLSTON STATION. RADIATION SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED ON THE ULD’S AND ALL VEHICLES USED IN THE BOSTON AREA WHICH CONTAINED THE PACKAGE. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH ALL PERSONNEL IDENTIFIED AS HANDLING THE PACKAGE. ADDITIONAL RADIATION SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED BY THE MASSACHUSETTS RADIATION CONTROL AGENCY OF THE FEDEX EXPRESS STATIONS, VEHICLE AND EQUIPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE PACKAGE. THE TENNESSEE RADIATION CONTROL AGENCY CONDUCTED RADIATION SURVEYS AT THE MEMPHIS HUB AND THE LOUISIANA RADIATION CONTROL AGENCY ALSO CONDUCTED RADIATION SURVEY AT THE NEW ORLEANS RAMP: ALL RESULTS WERE NEGATIVE.    ON FRIDAY, JULY 10 2015 A MEMPHIS LANDFILL OPERATOR REPORTED TO FEDEX EXPRESS THAT A DUMPSTER COMPACTOR AHD BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE MEMPHIS HUB WHICH ACTIVATED THE RADIATION ALARM. THE DUMPSTER WAS RETURNED TO THE MEMPHIS HUB WHERE THE CONTENTS WERE UNLOADED IN A CONTROLLED MANNER AND THE RADIOACTIVITY WAS ISOLATED BY FEDEX EXPRESS PERSONNEL. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT IN THE IDENTIFIED DEBRIS A TEAL COLORED SCREW TOP VIAL WAS BROKEN. THIS MEANT THAT ONE OR MORE OF THE VERY SMALL TITANIUM CAPSULES WERE LOOSE IN THE DEBRIS. FEDEX EXPRESS WAS NOT EQUIPPED TO RECOVER THE SMALL RADIOACTIVE TITANIUM CAPSULES, SO THE SHIPPER SPEC WAS CALLED IN TO COMPLETE THE RECOVERY.    SPEC ARRIVED AT THE MEMPHIS HUB ON SATURDAY MORNING JULY 11 2015 AND RECOVERED ON RADIOACTIVE CAPSULE.NO OTHER ACTIVITY WAS DETECTED. THERE WAS NO CONTAMINATION.

The employee was unaware that the mixture in the containers were undergoing a chemical reaction.  The  sealed plastic jerricans built up pressure and bulged.  The employee identified the bulging drums at another location.  He overpacked each of the Jerricans into their own 10 gallon overpack.  At a third customer location one of the inner 5 gallon jerricans ruptured.  The pressure blew the lid off of the overpack.  Contents of the acid/solvent waste splashed throughout the trailer.  Some liquid contents leaked out of the trailer and onto a small section of the customer's asphalt parking lot. The employee susstained an acid exposure to his eyes.  The employee flushed his eyes and body at an emergency eyewash/shower station.  The employee was taken to the emergency room for treatment and released that evening.  The local fire department hazmat team contained the spill.  Later that evening an environmental remediation company decontaminated the truck and asphalt.  The following day Veolia employees in chemical and ballistic suits repackaged the 2nd drum into a 55 gallon steel overpack with a pressure relief valve.,"The customer was notified of the incident.

HE HAD FINISHED LOADING HIS TRUCK WITH GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES EARLIER AT THE KINDER MORGAN TERMINAL IN SPARTANBURG, SC.    JOHN IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING (NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SAME LANE) AN SUV (LABLED AS V2 IN THE ATTACHED DIAGRAM) AS HIS TRACTOR-TRAILER APPROACHED THE WB ON-RAMP OF THE INTERCHANGE AT MM 17. ANOTHER SUV (LABELED AS V1 IN TEH ATTACHED DIAGRAM) IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ON THE WB ON-RAMP AT THIS TIME, PREPARING TO ENTER THE INTERSTATE ROADWAY.    THE INITIAL THEORY PUT FORTH BY THE HP AT THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT SUGGESTED THAT V1 AND V2 INTERFERED WITH ONE ANOTHER AS V1 ATTEMPTED TO ENTER THE ROADWAY.  THE INTERFERENCE MAY HAVE BEEN A COLLISION BETWEEN V1 AND V2, OR SEVERE SWERVING OR BRAKING BY EITHER VEHICLE. THE THEORY CONTINUES THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN V1 AND V2 RESULTED IN EITHER A COLLISION THAT AFFECTED THE TRACTOR-TRAILER (V3) DIRECTLY OR CREATED AND INSTANTANEOUS OBSTRUCTION IN THE PATH OF THE TRACTOR-TRAILER. TIRE MARKS AT THE SCENE SUGGEST THAT JOHN FINK TOOK EVASIVE ACTION BY BRAKING AND STEERING LEFT TO AVOID THE DEVELOPING HAZARDS.    THE TRACTOR-TRAILER WRECKED, COMING TO REST WITH THE TRAILER ACROSS BOTH LANES OF I-26 AT THE APPROACH TO A BRIDGE SPANNING RR TRACKS BELOW. THE TRACTOR WAS SLIGHTLY OFF THE ROADWAY TO THE LEFT.    V1 INCURRED DAMAGE AND WAS STOPPED ABOUT 1/4 MILE FURTHER DOWN THE INTERSTATE (BEYOND THE BRIDGE DECK). V2 ALSO WRECKED. ITS FINAL POSITION WAS BETWEEN THE TRAILER AND THE BRIDGE DECK.    EITHER DURING THE COLLISION(S) DESCRIBED ABOVE OR THEIR IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH, THE CARGO ON V3 WAS IGNITED. V2 AND V3 WERE COMPLETELY CONSUMED BY FIRE. ONE OCCUPANT OF V2 AND TWO OCCUPANTS OF V3 WERE KILLED-EITHER BY THE WRECK OR BY THE FIRE.  ANOTHER OCCUPANT OF V2 WAS SEVERLY BURNED. V1 WAS DAMAGED FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR THROUGH TO AND INCLUDING THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS ONE OCCUPANT OF V1 AND HE WAS UNINJURED. A FOURTH VEHICLE, FOLLOWING V2 AND V3, DID NOT PLAY A ROLE IN THE ACCIDENT BUT WAS DESTROYED BY THE FIRE.  ITS OCCUPANTS WERE DESCRIBED AS UNINJURED.    EMERGENCY RESPONDERS EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE AND RECOVERED THE BODIES. INVESTIGATORS THEN COLLECTED DATA FROM THE SCENE. THIS TOOK SEVERAL HOURS. BY MID-AFTERNOON, THE WRECKAGE WAS ALLOWED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE SITE. PAVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WERE DONE LATER THAT EVENING. SOIL REMEDIATION IN THE MEDIAN AREA WAS PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING DAY. UPON COMPLETION OF THE REMEDIATION WORK, THE WB LANES WERE OPENED.","AT THIS TIME, IT APPEARS THAT THE DRIVER OF THE TRACTOR-TRAILER WAS A VICTIM OF POOR DECISIONS AND ACTIONS BY OTHERS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS DRIVING AT OR BELOW THE SPEED LIMIT. HE APPEARS TO HAVE ALSO MOVED (OR WAS MOVING) HIS TRUCK INTO THE LEFT LANE TO GIVE ADDITIONAL SPACE TO V1 AND V2.  ONCE IN THE LEFT LANE, HIS FOLLOWING DISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NON-FACTOR SINCE THERE WERE NO KNOWN OTHER VEHICLES IN THE LEFT LANE.  RECORDS FROM HIS COMPANY PHONE INDICATE THAT HE WAS NOT TALKING (VIA BLUE-TOOTH DEVICE) OR TEXTING AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THERE ARE NO KNOWN TRUCK MAINTENANCE ISSUES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT.    THE PRELIMINARY THEORY OF THE CAUSE OF THIS ACCIDENT SUGGESTS THAT V1 MAY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MERGE INTO OCCUPIED SPACE ON THE INTERSTATE.

THE WB ON-RAMP STARTS AT A POINT ABOVE THE GRADE OF THE INTERSTATE AND MERGES AFTER A SHORT AT-GRADE DISTANCE ONTO THE I-26 TRAVEL LANES.  LANDSCAPING OBSTRUCTS THE VIEW OF INTERSTATE TRAFFIC BY MERGING MOTORISTS AND VISE VERSA.  THE SHORT ACCELERATION LANE TAPERS TO NOTHING AT A NARROW BRIDGE (THE BRIDGE HAS TWO STANDARD-WIDTH TRAVEL LANES, BUT LITTLE OR NO SHOULDER WIDTH).  THIS CONFIGURATION MEANS THAT A VEHICLE ENTERING THE INTERSTATE MUST DEVELOP A HIGH RATE OF SPEED BY THE TIME IT IS IN A POSITION TO DECIDE WHERE IT WILL MERGE INTO INTERSTATE TRAFFIC.  THE ENTERING VEHICLE MAY NEED TO ACCELERATE FURTHER OR DECELERATE ABRUPTLY TO AVOID INTERSTATE TRAFFIC THAT COULD BE OCCUPYING DESIRABLE SPACE IN THE RIGHT TRAVEL LANE.

EVERIST,PRESIDENT,2271 ASHEVILLE RD,WAYNESVILLE,NC,28786,Carrier,"DRIVER JOHN FINK WAS TRAVELING WB ON I-26 NEAR MM 17 IN SOUTH CAROLINA AT APPROXIMATELY 7:30AM ON JUNE 26, 2015. HE HAD FINISHED LOADING HIS TRUCK WITH GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES EARLIER AT THE KINDER MORGAN TERMINAL IN SPARTANBURG, SC.    JOHN IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING (NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SAME LANE) AN SUV (LABLED AS V2 IN THE ATTACHED DIAGRAM) AS HIS TRACTOR-TRAILER APPROACHED THE WB ON-RAMP OF THE INTERCHANGE AT MM 17. ANOTHER SUV (LABELED AS V1 IN TEH ATTACHED DIAGRAM) IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN TRAVELING ON THE WB ON-RAMP AT THIS TIME, PREPARING TO ENTER THE INTERSTATE ROADWAY.    THE INITIAL THEORY PUT FORTH BY THE HP AT THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT SUGGESTED THAT V1 AND V2 INTERFERED WITH ONE ANOTHER AS V1 ATTEMPTED TO ENTER THE ROADWAY.  THE INTERFERENCE MAY HAVE BEEN A COLLISION BETWEEN V1 AND V2, OR SEVERE SWERVING OR BRAKING BY EITHER VEHICLE. THE THEORY CONTINUES THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN V1 AND V2 RESULTED IN EITHER A COLLISION THAT AFFECTED THE TRACTOR-TRAILER (V3) DIRECTLY OR CREATED AND INSTANTANEOUS OBSTRUCTION IN THE PATH OF THE TRACTOR-TRAILER. TIRE MARKS AT THE SCENE SUGGEST THAT JOHN FINK TOOK EVASIVE ACTION BY BRAKING AND STEERING LEFT TO AVOID THE DEVELOPING HAZARDS.    THE TRACTOR-TRAILER WRECKED, COMING TO REST WITH THE TRAILER ACROSS BOTH LANES OF I-26 AT THE APPROACH TO A BRIDGE SPANNING RR TRACKS BELOW. THE TRACTOR WAS SLIGHTLY OFF THE ROADWAY TO THE LEFT.    V1 INCURRED DAMAGE AND WAS STOPPED ABOUT 1/4 MILE FURTHER DOWN THE INTERSTATE (BEYOND THE BRIDGE DECK). V2 ALSO WRECKED. ITS FINAL POSITION WAS BETWEEN THE TRAILER AND THE BRIDGE DECK.    EITHER DURING THE COLLISION(S) DESCRIBED ABOVE OR THEIR IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH, THE CARGO ON V3 WAS IGNITED. V2 AND V3 WERE COMPLETELY CONSUMED BY FIRE. ONE OCCUPANT OF V2 AND TWO OCCUPANTS OF V3 WERE KILLED-EITHER BY THE WRECK OR BY THE FIRE.  ANOTHER OCCUPANT OF V2 WAS SEVERLY BURNED. V1 WAS DAMAGED FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR THROUGH TO AND INCLUDING THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS ONE OCCUPANT OF V1 AND HE WAS UNINJURED. A FOURTH VEHICLE, FOLLOWING V2 AND V3, DID NOT PLAY A ROLE IN THE ACCIDENT BUT WAS DESTROYED BY THE FIRE.  ITS OCCUPANTS WERE DESCRIBED AS UNINJURED.    EMERGENCY RESPONDERS EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE AND RECOVERED THE BODIES. INVESTIGATORS THEN COLLECTED DATA FROM THE SCENE. THIS TOOK SEVERAL HOURS. BY MID-AFTERNOON, THE WRECKAGE WAS ALLOWED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE SITE. PAVEMENT IMPROVEMENTS WERE DONE LATER THAT EVENING. SOIL REMEDIATION IN THE MEDIAN AREA WAS PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING DAY. UPON COMPLETION OF THE REMEDIATION WORK, THE WB LANES WERE OPENED.","AT THIS TIME, IT APPEARS THAT THE DRIVER OF THE TRACTOR-TRAILER WAS A VICTIM OF POOR DECISIONS AND ACTIONS BY OTHERS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS DRIVING AT OR BELOW THE SPEED LIMIT. HE APPEARS TO HAVE ALSO MOVED (OR WAS MOVING) HIS TRUCK INTO THE LEFT LANE TO GIVE ADDITIONAL SPACE TO V1 AND V2.  ONCE IN THE LEFT LANE, HIS FOLLOWING DISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NON-FACTOR SINCE THERE WERE NO KNOWN OTHER VEHICLES IN THE LEFT LANE.  RECORDS FROM HIS COMPANY PHONE INDICATE THAT HE WAS NOT TALKING (VIA BLUE-TOOTH DEVICE) OR TEXTING AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THERE ARE NO KNOWN TRUCK MAINTENANCE ISSUES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCIDENT.    THE PRELIMINARY THEORY OF THE CAUSE OF THIS ACCIDENT SUGGESTS THAT V1 MAY HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MERGE INTO OCCUPIED SPACE ON THE INTERSTATE.
