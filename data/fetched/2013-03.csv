Appropriate notifications were made and KCS emergency responders were activated.     Upon further inspection, tank car FURX 130333 was found with a defective liquid line valve which had bent/deformed stop tabs. Due to the defective stop tabs, the valve was placed past the closed position, placing the ball valve in the slightly reversed open position. The afternoon sun built up enough internal pressure to push the liquid lading past the open liquid valve and then by the unsecured secondary closure plug. The secondary closure plug threads were not prepared with Teflon tape.    After the valve was placed in the closed position, the liquid product held on top of the ball valve indicating that the valve was operational--if positioned correctly. The tank car was vented, the liquid valve was opened to allow the lading trapped above the valve to drop back into the tank car. Then the valve was placed in the closed position and the plug was tightened tool tight. The protective housing tamper seal"" Calumet-022069"" was removed and replaced with seal number ""0237728.""   The estimated release was one gallon.     During the response, it was noted that the vapor valve also had a defective stop tab. It is suspected that the load/unload operators are stepping on these valve handles to cause the damage to the stop tabs.     *The lading contained in this tank car is VM+P Naphatha, which is an automotive type paint thinner, which flashes off (evaporates) very quickly. There is no inhalation hazard associated with this type of outdoor release. The primary hazard associated with this commodity is a low flash point and possible ignition of the flammable liquid.     The responder reported the defect and release to the shipper and they will have the valve replaced after the car is unloaded. The DOT specification package is now in compliance and can proceed safely in transportation.    *KCS emergency services were activated to provide for railroad safety qualified services to mitigate this emergency (e.g., yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, management oversight, train/yard crew delay, and regulatory notification reports).  KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 will apply.     * No injuries reported    File Note Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk q","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities,   and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable.    For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence   of unsafe transportation conditions.    The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs. To improve communications the shipper can provide contact information in this web site (Contact Network) to better facilitate incident response and post incident communications as applicable.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

Once the leaking amine car was secured the train was moved into the yard and a supervisory crew switched UTLX 66051 out of the train and isolated it on the spill pan in the yard.  Dupont personnel, who were in the yard already, checked the car and determined that the rupture disk had burst.  A contractor was called to replace the disk and clean the outside of the car.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Norfolk Southern Railway Company,US,

Emergency notifications were made and responders activated.    Upon inspection by responder, it was noted that the source of the leak was from the liquid line 4 bolt flange, 2 bolts were less than tool tight. Responder tightened the flange to appropriate tightness and performed an initial cleanup of lading on side of tank car. Responder de-mobilized due to lack of daylight and returned on 3/17/2013 in the morning. Responder performed final cleanup and notified KCS. The tank car was then released back into regular transportation.    * No injuries reported    File Note Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities,   and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable.    For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence   of unsafe transportation conditions.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

While moving the tote into the trailer, the employee accidentally steered the tote against the side wall of the trailer. An aluminum side panel for placarding, which is attached to the tote, was squeezed against the side of the receiving trailer and tote, and subsequently a bottom sharp edge of the panel punctured the side wall of the tote spilling an estimated 20 gallons of material.  The puncture in the tote was located in the middle side of the tote.  The release lasted approximately one hour and the material that leaked was cleaned up and sent to a proper waste disposal facility.  The remaining waste in the punctured tote was transferred into a new tote for disposal.  The punctured tote was sent to a proper waste disposal facility.","Veolia employees at Schenectady, NY were trained to not steer totes up against the side wall of trailers when loading and offloading using an electric pallet jack.

Fuller Environmental of Canton, Texas responded to assess the site, and pumped remaining free product from the damaged tank.  Approximately 840 gallons of virgin product were pumped from the tanker.  Fuller Environmental proceeded to recover the free product, which had pooled in constructed collection pits, and secured the site pending excavation activities.  Fuller Environmental returned to the site, excavated the impacted soils, and coordinated disposal of waste generated during response.  Excavation area was approximately 60 feet long by 20 feet wide.  Depth of soil contamination ranged from 7 feet to 9 feet in some areas.  Approximately 2,450 yards of soil were recovered during excavation.  Disposal was coordinated in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  Confirmation soil samples were pulled, and site was restored to preexisting condition.

While at truckstop, a leak was discovered from the tanker. Upon investigation, it was determined the leak occurred due to a manufacturer defect on the bung. Free product released to the asphalt parking lot. Elko Sheriffs Department responded to assess the site, and applied absorbents to the free product, which contained to immediate area. Elko Fire Department was dispatched to respond, isolated the area, and closed off the truckstop as a precautionary measure. Clean Harbors Environmental of Carlin, Nevada was dispatched to perform the cleanup. Upon arrival on site, Clean Harbors assessed the area and took control of the incident. Leaking product had been contained to an impervious surface, and did not migrate to surface soils or threaten to enter waters of the state. A drum was placed under the leak, to prevent further contamination, area was isolated and secured, and truckstop was reopened for business. Clean Harbors applied additional absorbent to the asphalt lot, and proceeded to monitor and contain the leaking product, pending arrival of a clean certified tank for offload. Once clean tank arrived on site, Clean Harbors offloaded product from damaged tank, and pumped out virgin product from container drums into certified tank. Spent absorbent material was recovered into six (6) 55-gallon drums. Affected area was pressure washed and neutralized, and rinsate water was containerized into one (1) 55-gallon drum.

Per the operator that responded to the leak and photos taken at the site, a leak was identified in the vicinity of the final plug thread area downstream of the valve on the liquid loading line. The valve was found to be tightly closed and no evidence of damage was noted.  The operator applied additional torque to the plug and was able stop all leaking, which was verified with a bubble test.

Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non-accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence.     It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions. The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs.

As a result of the derailment, tank car ETCX 623811, load of Propionic Acid rolled over onto its side and sustained damage to the liquid line valve.  The incident was reported to CHEMTREC report #2013-03-23-00052 and Eastman Chemical, Marilyn Williams, 903 -235-8850.  CSXT Hazardous Material Managers inspected the derailed tank car and found the cause of the release was due to damaged and bent liquid line valve mounting flange bolts.  This allowed a separation between the base of the liquid line valve and manway cover plate.  The breach between the two components resulted in the loss of 1,114 gallons of product.  Re-railing crews uprighted the tank car and positioned the container in a nearby field for transfer.

High Street; Suite 200,Pottstown,PA,19464,Other-Contracted Facility Oper,"At 12:50pm, while conducting a transfer of Diisobuytlene from railcar to a staged tanker trailer, operator Tim Mosher left the top of the portable platform pump, while it read 7,000 gallons, to sit inside the Ford Ranger service vehicle to escape the elements (ambient temp. 20° F Low/32° F High, and 50 mph wind gusts).  The service vehicle was parked approximately 20 feet away from the transfer, with the ignition turned off and a line of sight to the pumps meter counter.  Mr. Mosher drifted off to sleep while in the vehicle, and when he came to, he realized that the tanker trailer's capacity was exceeded and product was accumulating in the carsh box and releasing onto the underlying gravel and dirt surface.  Mr. Mosher exited the vehicle and pushed the emergency stop on the pumps main control panel, at the base of the unit.  The pump was successfully stopped and Mr. Mosher immediately notified supervisor Bill Clark of the release via radio.  All onsite transfer activity was suspended and ER activities commenced.  The estimated product loss was 700 gallons.","- Operator Tim Moshier was terminated due to his negligent behavior and failure to abide by established procedure (e.g., staying in attendance of a transfer and being attentive and in control of the transfer).     - Add to monthly safety observations listing check to ensure that operators are in attendance of the transfer and attentive.    - Retrain employees on the importance of staying in attendance of the transfer, while also being attentive and in control of the transfer.    - Compose vapor “T” fitting adapter to effectively utilize an outage alarm on the trailer’s false dome.    - Have warning signs fabricated by a local vendor which state “Absolutely” No Smoking; No Cell Phones; No Electronic Devises; No Vehicle Ignitions Sources within 25’ of the transfer area.

No defects were found after the train conductor inspected the train consist. This train was restarted and subsequently went into an emergency brake application. Train inspection revealed two rail cars derailed upright. The cause of the derailment was attributed to the cross level of track irregular, not at joints. Derailed equipment included entrained residue tank UTLX 645913 which incurred a damaged bottom outlet valve assembly (BOV) from contact with its leading truck/wheel set (A-end) that disengaged. The BOV was sheared off below its mounting flange with the internal valve closure remaining intact in the closed position. Residue commodity dripped from the damaged BOV orifice. A catch receptacle was placed under UTLX 645913 to capture commodity drips from the damaged BOV area. UTLX 645913 was cleaned and purged of hazardous material and is awaiting disposition to a designated qualified repair facility. The tank car cleaning rinseate is earmarked for appropriate disposal.

The liquid line valve under the valve housing cover sustained damage and was partially dislodged at its mounting flange allowing commodity to escape. Mechanical responders plugged the exposed liquid line orifice which stopped the commodity release. The cause of the roll-out was attributed to a defective retarder yard skate.

ALL PERSONS LISTED ABOVE UNDER ""INDIVIDUALS CONTACTED"" WERE ON SITE WHEN WE ARRIVED. DALE GREER STATED THAT THE TOWN OF MOSHEIM FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS DISPATCHED SHORTLY AFTER THE RELEASE.  DALE GREER STATED THAT IT WAS HIS UNDERSTANDING THAT THE DRIVER, STEVE RADER OF ROGERS PETROLEUM, HAD PARKED THE DELIVERY TRUCK OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE TANK PIT. THIS LOCATION HAD THE TRUCK SET UP TO DELIVER THE FUEL INTO THE REGULAR GASOLINE TANK FILL PORT, BUT BLOCKED THE DRIVER'S VIEW OF THE ATG PROBE PORT OF THE TANK WHILE HE WAS MAKING THE DELIVERY. ACCORDING TO OFFICER WYKLE'S AND MR. GREER'S ACCOUNTS, MR. RADER HEARD SOME METAL RATTLING DURING THE DELIVERY SO HE WALKED AROUND THE DELIVERY TRUCK AND WITNESSED THE RELEASE OF GASOLINE COMING FROM THE ATG PORT.  IT IS UNCLEAR AS TO WHY THE DRIVER DID NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THE BALL FLOAT VALVE RESTRICTED THE DELIVERY FLOW (WHEN THE TANK WAS AT 90% CAPACITY) PRIOR TO THE RELEASE. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF FUEL ON THE DELIVERY TRUCK VERSUS THE AMOUNT TO BE DELIVERED INTO THE TANK IS UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME.  THE GASOLINE FLOWED TOWARD THE PARKING LOT CURB. THERE ARE THREE DRAINAGE OVERFLOW SPOTS OR BREAKS ALONG THE CURB. ACCORDING TO OFFICER WYKLE'S STATEMENT, HE ARRIVED AT 4:14 AM, SPOKE TO THE DRIVER AND BEGAN TO WALK THE PERIMETER OF THE AREA. AT THIS TIME, TWO TOWN OF MOSHEIM FIRE DEPARTMENT UNITS ARRIVED AND THEY PROCEEDED TO APPLY ABSORBENT TO CONTAIN THE FLOW OF THE FUEL AND THE THREE DRAINAGE OVERFLOW SPOTS WERE ""DIKED"" TO STOP FUEL FROM FLOWING OVER THE CURBED AREA. OFFICE WYKLE THEN CALLED 911 TO DISPATCH HAZ-MAT UNITS FROM GREENEVILLE/GREENE COUNTY TO ASSIST WITH THE CLEAN-UP, JIMMY ARRIVED AT 5:20 AM. AMERICAN ENVIRONMENTAL  ARRIVED AT 7:20 AM. TIM NEAL ARRIVED AT 11:00 AM.  JIMMY AND DALE SHOWED US THE PATH THE FUEL TOOK. ONLY ONE OF THE THREE DRAINAGE OVERFLOWS (THE ONE NEAREST TO IDELL ROAD) APPEARED TO BE AFFECTED BY THE FUEL. AMERICAN ENVIRONMENTAL, WITH OVERSIGHT FROM JIMMY, EXCAVATED 30 CUBIC YARDS OF SOILS FROM THAT AREA AND PLANNED TO REMOVE MORE PRIOR TO SAMPLING. MOST OF THE FUEL FOLLOWED THE PARKING LOT ALONG THE CURB TO THE LOW SPOT NEAR THE CULVERT FOR STONY CREEK. THERE WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL ON MARCH 11 AND EARLY MARCH 12 CAUSING THE CREEK TO BE SEVERAL FEET ABOVE ITS NORMAL LEVEL AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE. TINA ROBINSON SAID SHE HAD SPOKEN WITH SOME OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND THEY TOLD HER THE CREEK WAS FLOWING HIGH AND AT A VERY FAST RATE OF SPEED DURING THE SPILL.
