UPON ARRIVAL AT APPROXIMATELY 12:45 PM, THE RIEDEL CREW DISCOVERED A SMALL AMOUNT OF LIQUID (8 TO 12 OUNCES) HAD LEAKED FROM THE TRAILER AND ONTO THE CONCRETE FLOOR AT THE COORS RECEIVING DOCK.  THE AREA IMPACTED BY THE LEAK WAS LESS THAN ONE CONCRETE FLOOR AT THE COORS RECEIVING DOCK.  THE AREA IMPACTED BY THE LEAK WAS LESS THAN ONE SQUARE FOOT, AND DID NOT INVOLVE ANY WATERWAYS, OR ACCESS TO A WATERWAY VIA THE SEWER SYSTEM.  THE RIEDEL CREW DETERMINED THAT THE LIQUID WAS A SODIUM HYDROXIDE BASED METAL CLEANER, AND IMMEDIATELY NEUTRALIZED THE LIQUID WITH CRITIC ACID.  INSIDE THE TRAILER WERE SIXTY DRUMS OF THE CLEANER (DCT CR-23-66).  THE RIEDEL CREW INSPECTED THE DRUMS AND DISCOVERED THAT EVERY ONE OF THE DRUMS HAD LOOSE BUNGS. EACH BUNG WAS ONE AND ONE-HALF TO TWO DRUMS FROM BEING TIGHT ENOUGH TO SEAT THE GASKET WHICH SEALS THE DRUM.  AS A RESULT, NEARLY EVERY DRUM HAD DCT-CR-23-66 ON THE TOP DRUM DUE TO JOSTLING DURING TRANSPORTATION AND EXPANSION DUE TO THE CHANGE IN ALTITUDE FROM MICHIGAN TO COLORADO.  THE SOURCE OF MATERIAL ON THE TRAILER FLOOR WHICH LED TO THE EXTERNAL LEAK WAS A GROUP OF FOUR DRUMS AT THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER WHICH HAD PARTIALLY SHIFTED OFF OF THEIR PALLET.  BY BEING PARTIALLY OFF THEIR PALLET, THESE DRUMS WERE RESTING AT ANY ANGLE WHICH ALLOWED THE DCT-CR-23-66 TO RUN OFF THE TOP OF THE DRUM AND ONTO THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER.  ONCE THE SITUATION INSIDE THE TRAILER WAS ASSESSED, CLEANUP OF THE DRUMS AND TRAILER BEGAN. THE RIEDEL CREW SPREAD CITRIC ACID ON THE TOPS OF THE DRUMS TO NEUTRALIZE THE LEAKING MATERILA.  THE BUNGS ON EACH DRUM WERE THAN TIGHTENED AND THE PALLETS REMOVED FROM THE TRAILER USING A FORKLIFT PROVIDED BY COORS.  THE DRUMS WHICH HAD SHIFTED OFF OF THEIR PALLETS WERE PLACED BACK ON PALLETS AND REMOVED AS WELL.  ONCE THE TRAILER WAS EMPTY, THE APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF GALLON OF DCT-CR-23-66 WHICH WAS ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER WAS NEUTRALIZED WITH CRITIC ACID.  WATER AND RAGS WERE THEN USED TO MOP UP THE MATERIAL FROM THE FLOOR UNTIL THE RESIDUE WAS REMOVED.  THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRAILER WAS CLEANED IN A SIMILAR MANNER AS WELL AS THE IMPACTED CONCRETE.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A SMALL AMOUNT OF DCT-CR-23-66 REMAINED WITHIN THE CRACKS BETWEEN THE TRAILER FLOOR AND ITS UNDERSIDE WHICH ARE INACCESSIBLE WITHOUT DISMANTLEMENT OF THE TRAILER.  INSPECTION OF THE TRAILER TO ASSESS CORROSION RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT IS RECOMMENDED.  ALL SIXTY DRUMS WERE CLEANED AFTER NEUTRALIZATION USING RAGS AND WATER.  THE DRUMS WERE CLOSELY CHECKED FOR DAMAGE AND NONE WAS DETECTED.  AFTER CLEANING, THE COORS REPRESENTATIVE INSPECTED THE DRUMS AND ACCEPTED THE ENTIRE SHIPMENT.  THE DRIVER INSPECTED THE TRAILER AND RELEASED THE RIEDEL CREW AT APPROXIMATELY 3:30 P.M.  IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTION REGARDING THIS RESPONSE PLEASE CONTACT ME AT (303) 373-4400.

CAR UNPX 120680 WAS INVOLVED AND THE CONTENTS WERE ON FIRE.  ON ARRIVAL ZERWECK MET WITH ED BOBBITT, LOUISIANA STATE POLICE HAZMAT, AND DETERMINED THE CONTENTS TO BE SODIUM CHLORATE ON FIRE IN THE BALLAST.  ZERWECK, BOBBITT, AND THREE CADDO COUNTY FIRE FIGHTERS USED A 2 1/2 INCH WATER LINE TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE BY 0700.  THE SPILLED PRODUCT FROM RIPS TO THE CAR WAS ESTIMATED AT 400 LBS.  TERRY LITCHFIELD, CXY CHEMICAL WAS ON THE SCENE BY 0830 AS WAS TOM ROBINSON WILL SUPPLEMENT THIS REPORT DETAILING THE CLEANUP. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AS REPORTED BY T.M. ROBINSON, SR., REGIONAL MANAGER CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD:  HOPPER CA UPNX 120860, A LOAD OF SODIUM CHLORATE IN CRYSTALLINE FORM, IS OF ALLUMINUM CONSTRUCTION.  AS A RESULT OF THE DERAILMENT, THE CAR SUSTAINED DAMAGE WHICH RESULTED IN LOSS OF AN ESTIMATED 2 TO 3 PERCENT OF THE LOAD. THIS INCLUDES PRODUCT LOST DURING THE SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER OPERATION. DAMAGE TO THE CAR CONSISTED OF ""CUTS"" ALONG THE SIDES AND THE DROP BINS OF EACH HOPPER.  THE INITIAL LOSS OF CONTENTS DUE TO THESE CUTS WAS APPROXIMATELY 400 POUNDS.  RESOURCES UTILIZED BY UPRR TO CONTROL AND MITIGATE THIS INCIDENT INCLUDED EMTECH INC. AND RONNIE WALL INC.  DURING THE FIRST DISCUSSIONS REGARDING REMOVAL OF THE HOPPER CAR FROM THE RAILROAD RIGHT OF WAY, CONCERN WAS VOICED THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT WOULD BE SPILLED AND LOST.  IT WAS FEARED THAT THIS WOULD CREATE A MORE HAZARDOUS SITUATION.  MECHANICAL METHODS OF PRODUCT REMOVAL WERE DISCUSSED, (VACUMN TRUCK, AUGER CONVEYER), HOWEVER THE SHIPPER REPRESENTATIVES OBJECTED.  THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT THIS MIGHT RESULT IN FIRE EXPLOSION.  AFTER WEIGHING NUMEROUS OPTIONS, CONCENSUS WAS REACHED TO MOVE THE CAR FROM THE R.O.W.  THE MAINLINE RAIL IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE HOPPER CAR WAS REMOVED.  THE CAR WAS CLOAKED IN PLASTIC SHEETING AND THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH PLASTIC SHEETING.  THEN THE R.O.W.  THIS WAS COMPLETED WITH ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCT SPILLING. EMTECH AND RONNIE WALL PERSONNEL REMOVED THE SPILLED PRODUCT FROM THE R.O.W. THAT COULD BE SALVAGED.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THEN DISSOLVED THE REMAINDER TO ELIMINATE THE HAZARDS.  UPPR M.O.W. FORCES RESTORED THE TRACK TO SERVICE AT ABOUT 2359 HOURSOF 9/14/95.  UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF UPRR-CTSG AND CXYCHEM, EMTECH AND RONNIE WALL TRANSFERRED THE REMAINING CHLORATE FROM THE DAMAGED CAR.  ON FRIDAY AFTER (9/15/95), UPRR-CTSG MANAGER ARLA ROQUET RESPONDED TO CONTINUE  MANAGEMENT OF THE MITIGATION PROJECT FOR UPRR. THIS WORK CONTINUED THROUGH SUNDAY, 9/17/95.
