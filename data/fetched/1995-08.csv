AS A RESULT OF THIS ACCIDENT THERE WAS AN UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED AROUND 1:00 PM AND WAS CAUSED WHEN ERIKA TYLER, TRAVELING EAST BOUND, CROSSED THE MEDIAN IN HER AUTOMOBILE AND COLLIDED WITH A TRACTOR-TRAILER DRIVEN BY EIL SNYDER. THE TRUCK FLIPPED ON ITS SIDE, SPILLING ABOUT A TON HAZARDOUS MATERIAL.  THE VEHICLE LANDED ON IT RIGHT SIDE ABOUT 25 FEET FROM THE SHOULDER OF THE ROADWAY.  THE DRIVER WAS NOT SERIOUSLY INJURED AND ANOTHER VEHICLE TRAVELING WITH HIM NOTIFIED OUR COMPANY OF THE ACCIDENT/SPILL.  WE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES AS PER OUR CONTINGENCY PLAN.  AT 1:40 PM I CONTACTED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER AND NOTIFIED THEM OF THE INCIDENT  FILE #303003. AFTER SPEAKING WITH WEST VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENT, TOM FISHER, I CONTACTED WEAVERTOWN ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP IN CHARLESTON, WEST VIRGINIA.  THEY DISPATCHED MEN AND EQUIPMENT TO BEGIN CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS.  I THEN NOTIFIED THE GENERATOR, ROANOKE COUNTY AND ROANOKE ELECTRIC STEEL.  AT 3:30 PM I DISPATCHED ANOTHER TRACTOR TRAILER TO THE SCENE TO TRANSPORT MATERIAL FROM THE CLEAN-UP.  THE SPILLED MATERIAL AND THE CONTENTS OF THE TRAILER WERE REMOVED FROM THE SITE AND RETURNED TO THE GENERATOR.  CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS WERE COMPLETE AROUND 11:00PM THAT EVENING.  THE FOLLOWING DAY WEAVERTOWN RETURNED TO THE SITE TO SAMPLE THE AREA.  THE ANALYSIS OF THE SAMPLES SHOWED TWO AREA WHICH NEEDED FURTHER EXCAVATIONS.  ON FRIDAY AUGUST 18, 1995, WEAVERTOWN RETURNED TO THE SITE AND REMOVED THE REMAINING CONTAMINATED.  SOIL SAMPLES TAKEN AFTER EXCAVATION CONFIRMED COMPLETION AND THE REMAINING MATERIAL WAS ALSO TRANSPORTED BACK TO ROANOKE COUNTY.  WEAVERTOWN ENVIRONMENTAL THEN RETURNED TO THE SITE TO RE-SOD AND RE-SEED THE EXCAVATION SITE. THE SOIL AND WASTE COLLECTED AT THE ACCIDENT/SPILL SITE WAS STABILIZED AND DISPOSED ON SITE AT DIXIE CAVERNS LANDFILL, ROANOKE COUNTY, VIRGINIA, AS PER EPA'S APPROVAL.
