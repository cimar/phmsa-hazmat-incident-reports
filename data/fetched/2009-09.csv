CLEGHORN,SR. PROJECT ENGINEER,"1901 Briarwood Avenue, SW",FORT PAYNE,AL,35967,Facility,"The incident being reported involved a shipment of 2 part styrenated epoxy resin (UN1866, resin solution, 3,PGIII), with the Part A in 330 gallon IBCs and the Part B in 55 gallon steel drums.  The vehicle corrying the shipment arrived at the Siemens Energy, Inc. facility located at 1901 Briarwood Avenue SW, Fort Payne, AL 35967 at approxomately 13:30.  Upon opening the trailer door, the receiving personnel noted a strong odor of styrene coming from inside the trailer.  Inspection of the containers revealed that there was a 1/2 inch slit at the upper corner of one ot the IBCs, and that an amount of the resin estimated at 1/2 pint had sloshed out through the slit, down the side of the IBC and onto the floor.  There were also a few drops of the resin on one of the adjacent steel drums.  Receiving employee Hoyt McNew carefully removed the leaking IBC as well as the intact one and the steel drums and placed them on the receiving dock.  After speaking with his Safety Department, the driver Joe W. Smith spread absorbent material on the spill and left the Siemens facility.  The leaked material on the IBC and the steel drum were removed using paper towels moistened with methyl ethyl ketone, and a piece of duct tape was placed over the hole, which was above the liquid line, to prevent any further leakage.  The IBCs and drums were then transferred to a secure storage area until needed for production.",It is not known exactly when or how the IBC was damaged.  It was a new container Manufactured in June of 2009.  It was recommended to the driver that there be nspections made at any loading or transfer points in the future to prevent leakage during transit.,No,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Siemens Energy, Inc.",US,

The shipper contacted CURA and CURA dispatched SWS, a CSXT emergency response contractor to the scene.

SWS personnel removed the old gasket, cleaned the gasket area of rust build up and installed a new gasket. SWS representatives decontaminated the car, the leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did require a special switching move.

He stopped around 6am and advised nothing was leaking at that time.  Nothing was hitting the ground currently – just dripping on the axles and air lines, very slow leak.  However the vapor smell is strong.  He is at the BP (Sam’s Pitstop) in Delco, Nc.  Address is 27157 Hwy 74 – advised driver to stay upwind and keep the area clear of traffic and pedestrians.  He advised he stopped earlier and there was no signs of leaks at that time earlier in the morning.  Truck stop is basically empty right now where he is at.  He is updating the truck stop so they are aware that a spill response team will be showing up.    •         Contacted customer and they asked us to contact a spill vendor but that they had one on back up.  I contacted our vendor who had a team 90 miles out.  I asked the customer if they had any 1 closer to save on some money.    •         13:57pm – product had stopped leaking up to this point but now is leaking again.  Can smell 50-60 feet away – advised driver to get out of the area be where he can’t smell it.  Due to strong vapor smell I advised driver not to place plastic underneath to catch dripping product nor get close enough and to just leave the drips soak into the dirt and will have the response team clean it up later.  Later I learned driver had already placed plastic underneath.  Roughly 2 oz’s spilled on plastic when vendor arrived – still a slow leak rate.  At this point more traffic is coming inbound but not coming close enough to be a concern.  Hinging on notifying the authorities at this point.  Spill Team should be there in less than 30 minutes to assess the scene, give us a recommendation, and doesn’t sound like any immediate health risks.  Driver however mentions a mild sore throat and sinuses as he’s been breathing it for quite some time.  Advised again to stay up wind and distance himself from the area.  Seek medical attention immediately if symptoms persist longer than 30 minutes after being in fresh air.  He didn’t feel like it was anything to be concerned about and that he had had sufficient distance.      •         14:30 – driver advises fire chief is on the scene wanting answers.  Advised spill team arriving any minute now as ETA was 2:30pm.    •         Apprx 14:45 spill team is on site.  Opening doors of trailer which will require truck stop to be evacuated.  Correction it is evactuated in 200 feet in any direction.  The truck parking area closed but the pedestrian vehicle traffic on the other side of the building is still open.  Updated Janet Bonkowski/Ashley/and Barb from PR team.  Driver advised not to talk to media if they show up.    •         16:30 – Driver had disconnected his truck from trailer per my request and staged the bobtail away from the trailer.  During conversation again mentioned sore throat, chest, and sinus’s.  Advised it would be wise to seek medical attention.  Again said he was honestly not conc","A.  Packaging - Shipper will have to make recommendations on the failure of the valve.  Perhaps more frequent inspection or gasket replacement is required?    B.  Training - All drivers on this account will be retrained on what to do in the event of a spill.  The driver involved on this one will go through Performance Enhancement Training to ensure he knows what to do in the event of a spill and what constitutes a safe distance.      C.  The Truck:  We believe the resulting exposure that hospitalized the driver did not come from sitting in the truck.  We believe it was from being to close to the leaking product.  Before the doors of the trailer were opened exposing the vapors from teh rear of the trailer the truck was disconnected.  However we feel appropriate precautionary measures need to be taken.  301 Environmental was used to do the initial decontamination on the tractor.  Many of the drivers belongings have been disposed of like clothes, cooler, etc.  Electronics (TV, DVD, CB) were salvaged after decontamination.  The truck bedding was disposed of and the cloth seat covers and then shampooed twice.  The hard surfaces were cleaned twice with citri-clean in order to remove any potential contaminants.      HMHTTC (our Bulk Spill Vendor) was finally able to identify a Certified Industrial Hygienist at (Phoenix Enviro Corp) who is able to help document and verify the truck is safe and to meet OSHA’s exposure limit which is based off 8 the hour ‘sleeper time’.  He is working on providing me with a quote before doing the work so that we can stop it if deemed too expensive vs. retainment value.      The Plan:  • Swab various surfaces and have them analyzed for direct contaminants – specifically Benzene  • Two 8 hour days of testing will be performed on the tractor.   Each test runs for 2 hours and the detection media is changed out.  That means 4 tests will be performed each day.  It is a specific air testing machine which tests for chloride ions present in the air.    o Day 1:  Test with truck not running – general presence  o Day 2:  Test with truck running – I advised to run the tractor unit with the AC compressor engaged and the heat cranked up (heat generally makes any chemical agitated and moisture from the a/c compressor would react with remnants).    ¿ For anyone who may be confused at the statement of running the AC compressor with the heat cranked may sound odd.  Automakers have a default now when you turn on your defroster, even with the heat cranked, that it will engage the AC compressor which helps defrost better.  Engaging the AC compressor will introduce a small amount of moisture throughout the system which we know reacts negatively with the chemical identified here.  I am unsure if our trucks operate the same but he will ensure the a/c unit is engaged one way or other.  This way we are testing for worst case circumstances.    • The results will be sent to a 3rd party laboratory where the results will be analyzed  • Since the MSDS d",Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,12,0,1,0,2,0,16,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,31000,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

The trailer manifest and paperwork was inspected for Haz-Mat shipments.  After determining the trailer contained Class 3 Adhesives, the door was opened to see the extent of the leaking product.  After seeing the amount of the product leaked onto the trailer floor, the trailer door was shut and Chemtrec was called to get an MSDS for the product.  After consulting with the regional safety manager, it was determined that a vendor would be needed to clean up the spill. A qualified vendor was called to come out and perform the clean up.  In the meantime, the product remained contained in the trailer.  The vendor placed the product into salvage drums.  After the clean up was done, the vendor showed where the plywood dunnage had forklift holes thru the plywood causing the leak to occur.  The Damage to the drum was a direct result of forklift damage while loading.  There was a one-inch hole a little more than 3/4 up the drum where the puncture was made.

While offloading product at customer facility, the hose burst, which resulted in the releaseof approximately 100 gallons of free product.  The free product affected the concrete surface, migrated into the free standing water leaking from a damaged water faucet at the facility, and ran into the facility's drainage system.  There were no soils or waters of the state affected by the release.  United States Environmental of Memphis, TN responded to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, the customer PennAkem, had applied kitty litter to contain the free product.  United States Environmental used a pressure washer to clean the affected concrete, flushed the impacted drain, and recovered the spent kitty litter.  The drainage system outfall is a ditch area adjacent to the property.  Upon inspection, no free product was detected within the ditch.  Approximately 600 gallons of free product and water were generated during the cleanup.  Disposal will be coordinated in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.    SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT  The following is a supplemental report to Report Number E-2009090375, Tracking Number 476983. Originally, the initial report involved the release of approximately 100 gallons of free product. However, after further inspection, and customer evaluation, it was determined that no more than 30 gallons released. The majority of free product was water, which had released from the damaged water faucet at the facility. As previously reported, the free product affected the concrete surface, migrated into the free standing water, which had leaked from the damaged water faucet, and ran into the facility's drainage system. There were no soils or waters of the state affected by the release.United States Environmental of Memphis, TN responded to perform the cleanup.

As he was passing through Wasco, CA he stopped in the dirt parking lot of a mini-mart to purchase some food and take a lunch break.  Upon returning to his truck, he noticed that there was liquid dripping out of the front of the trailer.  He took the recovery drum out from it's storage location and placed it under the drip to capture any leaking chemicals.  He then called his immediate supervisor who called the local Fire Dept and Kern County Environmental Health Services.  The supervisor then called an emergency response contractor to respond to the incident.  Approximately 5 gallons of product leaked out of the tote, and <1 gal spilled onto the dirt.

The fiberboard box consisted of four (4), 11-ounce cans, in which one (1) 11-ounce can was damaged.  Apparently, the release was due to improper loading, which resulted in the release of approximately 11 ounces of UN1950 Aerosol, Flammable.  The free product was contained to the box, and contaminated the remaining cans in the fiberboard box. The Bax Global, Inc. DG Specialist performed the cleanup using gloves.

There were no injuries or exposures reported.  BAX Global shall be named as the reporting party only.

He was not allowed to climb on top of the trailer to check that the washout caps or dome lid is secure. He was able to do a slosh test inside the shippers plant and did so. At that time there was no product leaking from the trailer. When he made his turn out of their parking lot and proceeded up Hwy. 146 to his terminal (approximately 1/4 mile) he noticed that product was coming down the drain tube leading from the crash box. When at the terminal it was discovered that the loading operator failed to secure the dome gasket in place before closing the dome hatch. The dome was opened and a new gasket was put back in its place to secure product from any spillage. A slosh test was done again. No leaks were present and the product was delivered to the customer without any further delays.,"The shipper should retrain their employee's the proper procedure of closing a dome hatch to insure that the gaskets are in place. Also, they should allow the drivers that are picking up preloaded trailers or live loading trailers the ability to climb up the trailer to inspect the washout caps and the dome area when the shipping personnal are finished loading it.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Enterprise Transportation,US,

A tank trailer will only overflow if the scully system is not working properly.  A scully system is used to prevent product overflow while a transload is in progress by automatically shutting down the loading pump when a predetermined level of product is reached inside the tank trailer.   Investigation developed that the scully on the pump was in the over-ride position. All scully over-rides are kept locked at this location to keep any one from over-riding the scully. The third party vendor who calibrated the pump on 9/25/09 did not return the scully over-ride switch to the on position but left in over-ride which allowed product to overflow during loading of the tank trailer.  RSI Leasing personnel were monitoring the transfer process and immediately shut down the system and began containment and remediation of the spilled material.  All spilled material was contained and recovered using absorbent material on hand.  The waste absorbents material was properly packaged and disposed of.  Note:  The ""destination"" indicated in item 13, 1000 S. Van Dorn Street, Alexandria, VA, is the final rail destination but is only an intermediate point in transportation.

He was in the process of pumping the product from one trailer to another when the brass ears on one of the pump hoses vibrated loose and the hose detached from the pump.  As a result, product began to spill out of the hose. The driver immediately shut off the pump and then proceeded to run around to the emergency valves and shut them as well.  The driver failed to use his pump hose clamps to keep the hose ears from vibrating loose.  When utilizing a pump on the truck, it is possible for the vibration created from the pump to cause the hose connections to come loose. For that reason we provide hose clamps to keep the ears from becoming loose.  Upon spilling the product, Keystone personnel immediately tracked the product and discovered that the product ran through the parking lot (asphalt) and into a concrete corner of the lot where it soaked into some dirt that had accumulated. There were no waterways or storm drains effected at all.  We then began putting down oil-dry to keep the product from being spread anywhere.  The Dekalb Co Fire Dept was called and arrived at approximately 2330 hours.  Upon arrival, they verified that the product did not leave the parking lot and that no other area or waterways were effected.  The Dekalb County Fire Dept contacted the GA EPD and they determined, based on the circumstances, that they were not going to dispatch anyone to the site.  SWS First Response arrived on the scene at around 0100 hours and began cleaning up the product and the dirt that was impacted.  All of the product stayed on private property and never entered any streets or storm drains.",The driver is required to utilize the hose ear clamps provided so that this type if situation does not occur.  The driver at fault is being retrained on the proper use of our equipment and the standard operating procedures for our company. Bottom line is that human error caused this incident.  We are now looking into buying hoses with locking ears to avoid this from happening again.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3153,KEYSTONE PETROLEUM TRANSPORT,US,

The material that had leaked onto the floor of the truck was cleaned up with speedy-dry and absorbant pads.  The clean-up materials were placed into a cubic yard box for disposal. It was later determined that a plastic liner was not used inside the cubic yard box which allowed the material to leak through the fiberboard construction of the box.","The cause of the spill was due to human error.

However the customer hooked up the pump in the opposite direction and rather than unloading from our trailer into the customer tank it sucked product out from the customers storage tank and pumped into our trailer.  To further complicate the situation the customer tank we were hooked up to was the wrong one and therefore contaminated the product.  No reaction resulted but the trailer load of product was waste.,Our driver needed to verify the correct tank hook up prior to unloading.  This did not happen and resulted in a contamination.

Approximately one hour after leaving the Port Washington facility, the driver stopped at a store to purchase some personal items. As a standard practice the driver conducted a walk-around inspection of the vehicle and saw that a small amount of liquid was leaking from the trailer. The driver purchased a plastic wading pool from the store and absorbent materials. He placed the wading pool under the trailer to catch any liquid dripping from the trailer and put the absorbents on the asphalt surface where the material had already spilled. The material was identified as mercury contaminated waste water based on the shipping papers and appropriate notifications were made to NRC and WDNR. A Veolia response crew was dispatched to the spill site and cleaned up the spilled material, placed the leaking container into a salage drum and prepared the solid spill material for shipment to the end disposal/recycling site. While assessing the spill, it was discovered that the side of the steel drum had been dented and water was slowly leaking from a crease in the dent. The drum had not been leaking prior to loading, while in storage at the Port Washington facility. As such it is believed that the drum was damaged while loading the trailer and it did not begin leaking until after leaving the site. A total of less than 2 gallons of water was released. The water contained mercury in a concentration of 180 - 550 mg/kg. Based on this information a maximum of 0.0092 lb. of mercury was released.",Incident has been reviewed with operations staff and additonal training for personnel loading transport vehicles has been completed.,No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,825,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

Loaded as undeclared hazmat within container NYKU 571749 were two rubber-wheeled forklifts with propane fuel cylinders which were attached to the vehicles and connected with open tank valves.  Because the fuel tanks were not isolated by closing the valves before shipment, when falling from container NYKU 571749 the fuel tanks became dismounted from the forklift, rupturing the fuel tank line to vehicle and causing the hazmat release.  The valves were closed by KCS first responders, mitigating the hazmat release.                Correction notes.  These changes required because the railreport DOT interface failed.

UTLX 25389 was cordoned off in the railyard and all working switch crews were instructed to shelter inside the yard office complex. A BNSF hazardous material responder inspected UTLX 25389 and reported finding the vacuum relief valve (VRV) as the source of the vapor odor emanating from UTLX 25389. No liquid product release was evident, although it was noted that the top of this tank car had surface corrosion near the base of the manway nozzle. The responder removed the VRV finding the stem bottom pressure seal (O-ring) displaced. The VRV orifice was then plugged and sealed by inserting and securing a carbon steel plug.  Afterwards, no further product odor was detectable. This response was concluded by 2130 hrs. CDT, 9/17/09. A BNSF contract response team was on standby to monitor and decontaminate/clean the tank shell of UTLX 25389. UTLX 25389 was reinspected the morning of 9/18/09 and still found to be all secure. The valve housing cover was sealed with seal numbered SRS 000401.

Art indicated that something was wrong since the fuel gauge was not functioning properly.  Art was to dispense 300 gallons of diesel to the tank.  Normal procedure has been to fill the 750 gallon tank to the 715 gallon level.  After dispensing 562 gallons, the fuel guage was not indicating any additional fuel.  At that point Art requested an Outside Operator and John Ellis arrived.  Upon investigation, it was observed that the tank was completely full and excess fuel had exited through the tank vent.  The tank vent goes through the roof of the Raw Water Pump Building.  Diesel fuel exited the vent onto the roof and entered the roof drains.  The roof drains discharge into the raw water pump inlet sump.  Diesel fuel could be observed in the sump.  A vacuum truck was dispatched and removed the diesel fuel from the raw water pumps sump.  The collected diesel and water were then transferred to the fuel oil secondary containment.  After the water and diesel fuel had been placed in the fuel oil secondary containment, approximately 9 gallons of Remediact was mixed in with the water/diesel fuel.

BNSF hazardous material responders' inspections revealed no source of this reported odor, although tank cars inspected had small quantities of dried residue sulfur on the tank shell that likely spilled on the shell during the loading/unloading cycles. Later in the morning, one member of the switch crew that initially reported the odor, complained of inhalation symptoms and was taken to a local hospital, treated and released.  At approximately 1700 hrs. CDT, 9/30/09, another 'sulfur' odor was reported in this railyard. The same BNSF hazardous material responders inspections of sulfur ladened tank cars resulted in finding GATX 65013 (AAR 211A100W1 tank car) with a ruptured 165 psi frangible disc. During cleaning the hardened dried sulfur residue from the Salco safety vent assembly (required to replace the ruptured frangible disc), the safety vent assembly incurred damages. The orifice in the safety vent was covered and GATX 65013 was isolated in the railyard awaiting a replacement safety vent assembly.

When driver arrived back at Univar facility, he noticed the lid from 1 of the 5 drums had come off of the drum.  This allowed approximately 5 gallons of material to come free from the drum.  The material spilled onto the pallet, and adjacent drums/ pallet.  A portion of the material also splashed onto the floor and wall of the trailer.  The material was contained and cleaned by Univar personnel using floor dry materials.  The floor dry material, contaminated pallets, and clean up materials were properly packaged and sent for appropriate disposal as waste.  The drums were cleaned as part of the spill clean up process, and subsequently sent for disposal as intended.    The cause of the failure was failure to sufficiently tighten the nut / bolt holding the securing ring properly in place.  This allowed the securing ring to dislodge and subsequently the container lid to come off.",More in depth inspection of closed containers will be done by Univar employees and correction of any inadequately closed containers will be done.

While at railyard in Fremont, California, a leak was discovered from the tank car.  Railyard personnel applied sand to create a berm and contain the free product on the asphalt surface.  NRC Environmental Services, Inc. of Alameda, CA was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, free product was contained on asphalt and rail spurs within a 20x65foot area.    No soils and/or state waters were affected by the release.  Apparently the release occurred due to a leak from the sump, as a result of pressure, pending offload.  NRC Environmental Services applied absorbent material to the free product.  The spent material was recovered and containerized into sixteen (16) 55-gallon drums.  Disposal was coordinated by NRC Environmental Services in accordance with local, state, and federal regulatsion.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be related to pressure within the tank, pending offload, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

While in-transit, the Utah Highway Patrol was notified that liquid was dripping onto the highway.  A DOT unit of the Highway Patrol intercepted and followed our truck and trailer into our plant.    Upon investigation, it was determined that the material was leaking out of the dome lid, getting into the spill well, and coming out the over flow pipe.  We weighed the truck and trailer on our plant scale and the weight was compared to the gross weight at the Geneva Nitrogen plant, and the truck actually weighed 340 pounds more than it did when it was weighed on the shipper's scale.  Based on that information, and the appearance of dome lid, it was determined that no more than a gallon or two escaped.    After the Nitric Acid was unloaded and the tank trailer washed out, it was taken to the truck shop to determine the cause, where it was determined that the dome lid gasket got kinked as the driver closed the dome lid, preventing it from sealing properly.","We replaced the dome lid gasket with a ""rope type"" gasket that can't get moved out of its proper position by closing the dome lid.  We also changed every other gasket in our fleet that was similar to the one that failed, with the rope gasket.    We also replaced the swing bolts on the dome lid to make sure they performed at optimum ability.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Thatcher Transportation Inc.,US,

Approximately 15 minutes into the off-load they observed a rumbling noise; driver looked up and saw Cyanide spraying out of the top of the valve box on top of the trailer.  He immediately shut off the air supply to the trailer and left the area while the air pressure bled off the trailer. After pressure had bled off of the vessel, he went onto the top of the trailer and found that the bolts had worked loose on the flange of the safety relief valve.  He retightened the bolts on the flange, stopped the leak.  Mine Supervisors were called; after they gave the OK to restart the off load, he completed the off- load with out any more problems.  All product except for light misting was on containment.  Containment and trailer was washed down, misted dirt was removed and taken to leach pad.",Physical Contributors: Excessive depth on the containment pad caused the safety relief outlet from the tank to be submerged with product.  Unsupported weight of the safety relief valve hanging on the vertically mounted companion flange; gasket compresses over a period of time. System Contributors: No Procedure or Inadequate Procedure in Place.  Only procedure that relates to the Safety Valve is 5-year Inspection.  New hazard not found in walk around Audits. Trailer is due for 5-year pressure test in 3 months. Incorrect assembly of bolts on flange or time wear on bolts and gasket could be contributors. Pressure testing protocol is also in question. Human Contributors: Driver did pre-trip visual inspection of cabinet area and found no defects during pre-trip and prior to hooking up for unloading at customer site.

He was going to scale onsite when he was notified by plant associates that it was leaking.  The plant had their personnel clean up the spill.  When it was clean, the driver went on top of the trailer and found that the dome was not secure because a chain from the temperature probe was caught in the dome preventing it from sealing properly.  It was the consignee's probe.  Driver took it out, secured the trailer properly and moved it to the unload location.

The release was a result of overfilling of a tanker truck operated by Marchetti Corp. The No. 2 fuel oil was released to the pavement west of the loading rack at bay 14. The release was caused by the carriers driver who overfilled the tanker truck. The transfer of products at the facility is under the control of the carrier.  The carrier driver's access the loading rack via a card activiated system, activate the flow of product and conduct the transfer until complete.     Immediately following discovery of the release, Global personnel contained the release using absorbent pads. A Global representative notified the Revere Fire Department and the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection at  approximately 6:55 A.M. and 7:00 A.M, respectively, on September 16, 2009. In addition, Global notified the National Response Center and the U.S. Coast Guard. MassDEP assigned Release Tracking Number 3-28702 to the release. Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc. was called in to assist with the cleanup which was completed within approximately 3 hours of the release.    NOTE 1 - Global Petroleum Corp has completed this written report at the request of PHMSA. Global does not believe that it is required to make a written report for this incident.  The regulations under 49 CFR 171.16 require that ""each person in physical possession of a hazardous material"" at the time of an incident must complete a written report.  This spill was caused by the carrier who was in possession of the fuel product at the time the incident ocurred.  Global transfers possession of the product to the carrier at the time the product leaves the loading arm at the loading rack.  As the carrier was responsible for the transfer, and the spill overflowed from the carriers vehicle after the product left the loading arm, Global was not in possession of the product at the time of the incident, and therefore is not required to report under 49 CFR 171.16.    NOTE 2 - Global Petroleum Corp has submitted this report as the facility where the incident ocurred.  There are certain items related to the carrier that Global does not have access to; specifically information contained in items 10, 12, 26, 27 and 28.  To the extent possible, Global has entered the carriers information.  Note that fictitious dates (01/01/1900) were entered in Item 28 for the manufacture date and test date for the tanker to complete this electronic report.",Follow up training was conducted with the carrier driver as a refresher regarding global policies on loading vehicles at the terminal.

The operator was relying on his metering equipment to shutdown the movement once full. The meter was inadvertently reset during a temporary stop for gauging. In addition the operator did not tighten the bolts on the railcar gauge hatch as instructed in ITC Rail Loading procedures and the ITC Tank Car Loading Checklist. By not fully securing the gauge hatch, the overflowing liquid toluene did not enter the vapor line as designed. The vapor line is equipped with an auto-shutoff device that immediately stops a movement once liquid is detected. The operator assigned to the rail car did not keep the rail car within line-of-sight and was not in close-proximity as instructed by ITC procedures.","ITC has developed corrective actions to reduce the probability of an accidental overfill and offsite release from railcar loading at the D&E Loading Area.     Shortly after the incident, ITC management carefully reviewed relevant information gathered from the event and made the decision to terminate the loading operator based on failure to follow written procedures.  Operators are trained to properly secure all hatches before loading railcars. To reinforce this critical task, ITC will revise the Railcar Loading Checklists, operator qualification exams and the operating procedure to provide clear and detailed instructions on properly securing the dome hatch prior to loading and after every gauge stop. The proposed revisions will also emphasize the importance of staying in close proximity to the loading railcar.  In addition, all ITC shift supervisors and safety specialists will conduct more frequent inspections of loading operations during day and night shifts.     The D & E loading area has concrete containment with chemical drains that can contain most small spills.  Due to the magnitude of the event, the toluene overwhelmed the containment and flowed out of the south end of the track and onto the ground.  Once outside of containment, the toluene drained into a nearby storm water catch basin.  In order to provide a greater level of protection against off-property releases through storm water culverts, ITC’s Engineering Department is finalizing a plan to divert the storm water catch basins surrounding the D & E Loading Area into an ITC controlled storm water outfall equipped with a gate valve.  The valve operation will be under the control of an ITC environmental operator and will remain closed when facility drainage is not required.",Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,80000,"Intercontinental Terminals Company, LLC",US,

As he was rounding the curve to go to I 15 south bound the rear trailer swung out and hit the concrete barrier on the left and then rolled on to its side.  It was raining and dark because it was 4 am.  The driver was sited for going to fast for conditions.  Because of the force of the roll over on of the pipes on the spray fill line cracked and there was a small leak.  A towel was wrapped quickly around the pipe to stop the leak.  It only leaked for a short period of time (10 minutes aprox).,The drivers actions were reviewed by the companys safety commitee.  The driver was deemed at fault and was terminated.  This was a good reminder to other driver how severe a roll over is for the company.

He rounded a right hand turn when the rear right side wheels dropped off the road. The driver over corrected causing the load to shift turning the truck over. As it was   rolling it crossed the oncoming lane and slid over a bank. The accident caused damage to the hose reel and piping to the meter located on the rear of the truck. Approximately 20   gallons of liquid propane leaked due to the break in the piping. The liquid quickly   vaporized. The safety valves on the truck shut stopping all leaks. Only the propane in the pipe, meter and hose reel escaped. No other vehicles were involved and no one was   injured. The driver was taken to the hospital to be checked out then released by the   doctor.   The cab, meter and hose reel on the truck was damaged. The truck was sent to Propane   Trucks, Inc. in Apex NC for repairs. It received $16,865.00 in damages. A section of   guardrail was also damaged. It cost $1567.50 to replace.

Upon further inspection of his load, the driver noticed the IBC loaded near the rear of his trailer had developed a vertical split approximately 12 inches in length, down the crease near the corner. The dripping material migrated to the curbing, where soil and absorbent materials were used to create a dike, preventing further migration.   Upon discovery of the leaking IBC, the. driver called in to dispatch to report and set in motion Brenntag Pacific’s emergency response actMties. CURA Emergency Services was notified, who in turn contacted their sub-contractor, Patriot Environmental Services who responded to the incident.","Additional training addressing the proper application and/or alternative Securement. devices used for this type of cargo.

The passenger declared that a generator was being transported, but did not advice the airline that it had been used. The passenger drained the generator, but residual gasoline was left in the fuel tank. MKE station agent Armstrong tagged the box and directed the passenger to drop the box at the TSA screening point. TSA received the package and as they put it on the CTX belt, the package was tilted and fuel leaked. The side of the box had a stain and there was a strong smell of gasoline coming from the package. TSA turned the box to AE lead agent Ocon. Mr. Ocon recorded all the passenger information, and adviced that the item could not fly and that it had to be confiscated. The passenger said arrangements could be made to have a family member take the package home. Mr. Ocon donated the item back to the passenger. The spill was contained inside the box. The only proof of the leak were the gasoline smell and the stain on the box.",All MKE agents have been made aware of this incident to ensure that they screen packages more closely before they accept them.
