Approximately 85% of a 275-gallon poly tote has been punctured by a forklift resulting in the release to impact the trailer and the ground below. Terminal personnel have secured the release with various absorbents at this time. AT 1159 ET, Sustain, LLC dispatched EnviroServe to conduct initial cleanup and remedial activities. The contractor indicated that the release spread throughout the parking lot into a snowbank that leads to runoff drain that may lead to a waterway. The contractor indicated that approximately 30-gallons is left inside the tote. Due to the rain and the product spreading from the rain, additional manpower was requested. The product has been identified as AFS AWDA-3000. The contractor is placing absorbents down in the drain to stop the release from spreading and applying additional absorbents to the parking lot. The contractor utilized a PID meter near the impacted soil by the drain and the reading came back hot. The contractor covered the area with plastic sheeting for future remediation. Cleanup is complete pending the remediation. Contractor has generated (18) 55-gallon drums of impacted absorbent materials and (2) drums of product impacted with water for waste pending future disposition.",no comments provided,Yes,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,6000,Ward Trucking,US,

The car was isolated and Roehm  America LLC were notified (CHEMTREC Report #2022020600039). SPSI, a CSXT response  contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the vapors were being released from the  top of the tank car.  The liquid line valve was leaking from the threads where it threaded on to  the tank car. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper  Martin Hutton with Roehm America at 973-440-7558. Contractor personnel used a wrench to  tighten the valve and stopped the leak.  The leak was secured and the car will require an  approved OTMA prior to being released for transport.

There were not obvious issues with the pallet or container at the time of pick up. The pallet was safely loaded on our box truck and transported to Veolia's 10 day intransit facility located in  Poca, WV. After arriving at our facility the Veolia employee attempted to offload the pallet from the truck. As he removed the pallet, a board on the pallet broke causing the 95 gallon over pack to shift and fall to the floor below. When the 95 gallon over pack hit the ground the lid loosened allowing some of the liquid contents to spill onto the warehouse floor. Veolia is unsure if the container's lid was loose upon pick up or if the lid came loose as a result of the impact with the ground. Either way the lid was compromised in the fall which led to the spill. The initial spill was limited to the time it took our employee to get off the forklift and pick the container up. Our employee was able to use booms and floor dry to mitigate the effects of the release. Once contained he used spill pads and floor dry to absorb the liquid material. All spill debris was properly cleaned up and placed inside a spill clean up drum for proper disposal.","The lesson learned from this release is that Veolia needs to have a conversation with our customer and our employees. The customer should not classify a drum as a solid material if it contains a large amount of liquid. The customer should also properly secure any container before offering it up for shipment. In terms of Veolia employees, our team should always verify each lid to ensure it is properly closed. Veolia will have a meeting with the employee to discuss the incident and review the lessons learned with the employee. We will highlight the importance of double checking each container prior to transportation and we will also highlight the importance of checking pallet integrity before leaving a customers site.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The car was vented in a controlled manner periodically until trucks were able to offload the remaining product and the car was vented down to 0 psi.

The employee realized the leak right away due to the strong solvent smell. The employee may have been rushing to complete using the forklift due to forklift training being scheduled for new employees. The drum was placed immediately on its side to prevent it from leaking further and then was overpacked into an 851A2 salvage drum to continue transportation to the ultimate disposal facility.     The drum leaked about 10 gallons of mixed solvents after being struck by the forklift. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent and the drum was over-packed into an appropriate 85 gallon salvage drum along with the clean up materials. The duration of release is anticipated to be about 5 minutes no more than 10 gallons leaking.",On 2/22/2022 the Veolia safety manager was notified and performed an investigation of the incident. The results of the investigation is that the employee was rushing. The trailer was being filled with other containers and the employee was not immediately aware that they had struck a drum behind a pallet. Human error did have a role in this incident.

The WLE car inspector in our Hartland Yard in Collins, said that he could smell an odor and that the protective housing on the top the car was frosted over.  I went to Collins to look at the car.  I removed seal number 4835364 from the protective housing lid and found that both the liquid valves were leaking.  The valve handles were tight but I tried to tighten them a little more, which I was able to do so.  The valves all had nylon zip ties through the valve handle to keep them from being opened.  I had to remove them in order to get the valve handles to turn.  I could not get the liquid valve on the B end of the car to stop leaking even though it was shut properly.  I checked the valve plugs and found that they were loose.  I tightened the plus on both liquid valves and the vapor valve.  They were all loose.  Tightening the plugs on the liquid valves were the only way I could get them to stop leaking.  I had the cars brought to the main WLE rail yard in Brewster where I had the car owner come look at it.  The shipper obtained a movement approval from Collins, OH to Brewster, OH. They sent Enviroserve out to flare the car down in Brewster but found that there was a 200 gallon heal on the car so it could not be flared.  They did check to see if the valves were leaking and they said they were not.  They checked the pressure on the car and it was only 18 pounds.  They then came back with the proper equipment to do a proper test on the car with a pressure of 50 pounds.  They said that they could not get any of the valves to leak and when they took the plugs out of the valves, they looked good on the inside.  This car was approved for transportation by Enviroserve.  Perhaps the valves had ice inside them from leaking and maybe that's why they didn't seal.  I do not know.  This car was put back into service on 3-7-2022.

The trailer was located in dock door 44 of the Baton Rouge, LA SVC. Immediately a large release of vapor exited from the trailer. The situation was assessed and determined that there were 4 M350 gallon tote tanks of Nitric Acid(Pro#761684204) on th6 trailer and one of them had visibly leaked out onto the floor of the trailer. Regional Safety was contacted immediately. Precautionary measures were initiated, the immediate area of the trailer was cleared, there was no active leak or release on the ground, absorbent boom was placed on the ground around the trailer just in case. Hazmat One was called and arrived at 08:30am. Hazmat One took over the situation with the SEFL QAL assisting. Totes were removed from the trailer one by one and checked to determine where the product release was coming from. The initial determination by Hazmat One was that tote DA0014 had a bad lid seal on top and product had sloshed from the top during transit. They repaired and replaced the seal accordingly. It was later determined that there was an additional problem with tote DA00988. The tote was still releasing vapor from the bottom of one of the legs. USES flushed the leg with a water/ soda ash solution, however the tote continued to release vapor and product. It was then determined that there's a hairline crack above the leg in the bottom of the tote which is not visible to the eye. LA State Police Hazmat& Hazmat One agreed to place the tank in a containment area and caution tape the area off, until a replacement tank was received the next day 02/03/2022 from Garland, TX in order to transfer the product. Due to in-climate weather in the Dallas Tx area on 02/03/2022, the tank was not received due to trucks not being able to transport.
