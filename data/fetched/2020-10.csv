This was a residue propane. The yardmaster called me, john Vergis Hazardous Materials/environmental Officer for the WLE, and I went to the car which was in 12 track and noticed a very heavy vapor coming from the car.  When I climbed on top the car and removed the seal, number 24990685, I found that both the liquid lines were frosted and leaking.  The vapor valve also was leaking.  I tried turning the valves to see if they were tight and they were not.  All three valves took at least ¼ turn.  The vapor valve stopped leaking but the two liquid lines did not.  I then tried to tighten the valve plugs to see if they were loose.  They were less than tool tight.  I tightened them and the leak slowed considerably but did not stop.  I did not want to take the plug out of the valve not knowing how much force was going to be behind them.  I called Chemtrec to make a report and for them to get in touch with the shipper.  The waybill was not even close to having the right information on it as it had a Canadian company listed as the emergency contact and when I called them, they were not able to help me.  The PUCO finally gave me a name to call in Florida from Amerigas which got the ball rolling to get the issue resolved.  During all this, I called Enviroserve, and emergency Response Contractor, which came out to look at the car and they confirmed what I had thought, the valves were defective and needed replaced.  With permission of the car owner, Enterprise Products out of Canada, Enviroserve came out at 1400 hrs. and started to flare the car down.  They then on 10-2-2020, came back out and replaced both liquid lines and then bubble leak tested the car with Nitrogen.   The car passed the bubble leak test and the car was returned into transportation. New seal # 2880491 was applied to the protective housing.",Better procedures need followed when securing the car for transportation.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

The car was isolated and Marathon Petroleum, Kentucky Division of Emergency Management and National Response Center were  notified CHEMTREC Report #2020100500192. Marion Environmental Inc., a CSXT response  contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a detectable vapor release coming from the  bottom outlet valve secondary securement cap. Upon further inspection it was found that the bottom outlet valve was leaking liquid from around the ball in the valve, causing the secondary securement  cap to fill with liquid. The gasket in the secondary securement cap was damaged allowing a vapor  release. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Michael  Murray 606-921-6255. Contractor personnel changed the damaged gasket in the secondary  securement cap securing the vapor leak. The leaky bottom outlet valve was unable to be fixed in  the field.TILX280736 load was transferred into TILX280707 on-site. TILX280736 was completely  emptied and was moved on an OTMA back to the home shop for repairs.   2(5+1) x (2+0) = 24 Narri",(NAR Code:609 2 What Failed: Bottom Outlet Auxiliary Valve Where Failed: Auxiliary valve body Why Failed: Other),No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,15001,CSX Transportation,US,

They called myself, John Vergis Hazardous Materials Officer for the WLE, to investigate.  When I arrived, I did notice the protective housing being frosted and vapor coming from the top.  I climbed on top the car and removed seal number 18160789 and opened the lid to find that the liquid valve on the B end was frosted over and leaking.  I tried to tighten the valve to see if the leak would stop and it didn't.  I was able to get a slight turn out of it but it still would not seal.  I checked to see if the plug was loose since that's where it was leaking from and it was less than tool tight.  I tightened the valve plug and the leak stopped.  I also noticed that the valve stem on the A end of the car was bent.  The valve was not leaking but needs replaced.  I called Enterprise Products in Canada who owns the car and we will be making arrangements with them to get the car repaired.

The car was isolated and  Marathon Petroleum, Kentucky Division of Emergency Management and National Response Center were notified CHEMTREC Report #2020102300170. Marion Environmental Inc., a CSXT response  contractor,was dispatched to the scene and found a detectable vapor release coming from the threaded  connection at the bottom end of the vapor valve. Upon further inspection it was found that the  bottom female threaded connection of the valve had threads that were stripped/missing allowing  the connection to leak. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the  shipper Michael Murray 606-921-6255. Contractor personnel changed the damaged valve out and  replace it with a suitable AAR spec valve. After the valve replacement, technician’s pressure tested  the vessel with nitrogen to verify that the new valve was not leaking.TILX191089 was moved on an  OTMA back to the home shop for repairs.   2(5+1) x (2+0) = 24 Narri Score","(NAR: 598 5 What Failed: Bottom Outlet Auxilliary Valve Where Failed: Connection of auxiliary valve to bottom outlet valve Why Failed: Mounting flange bolts/nuts threads worn, cannot be secured)",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8600,CSX Transportation,US,

(Decanted Oil). Reportedly there was product around the manway and the  manway gasket was not properly sealed. The tank car was removed from the outbound train and isolated. The Consignee,  New York Terminals, was notified directly. Marion Environmental, a Conrail emergency response contractor, and Joe Caccamo Conrail Hazardous Material Manager were both dispatched to the Bayway Yard. Upon investigation it was found that the  manway had released product and the gasket was in shreds thus not allowing a proper seal against leakage. The shipper  representative International Chemical Co. who is the Freight Payer, Tracy Gallemore, 918-496-7711 was notified of the situation found and would contact their Shipper provider Midwest Terminals Toledo Intl. Once the gasket was  replaced and the tank car properly secured it was released back to transportation.

He opened his external and internal valves allowing product to flow via gravity. The driver started applying air pressure from the front of the tanker and when he returned to the rear of the tanker he noticed drips (being captured by his bucket). He closed his internal and external valves, shut down the air pressure and reaffixed the hose to the customer fitting using a shim. He opened his external and internal valves again and confirmed there were no longer leaks. As the driver was returning to the front of the tanker to apply air, the safety pressure relief valve popped releasing spray in the customer's receiving garage and also down on our driver.  Our driver engaged the customer's safety shower for at least 15 minutes. He was contacted by sulfuric acid on the top of his ear and a small amount on his left cheek.

The trailer was quarantined and a contractor was dispatched on 10/29/20 to transfer the damaged tote into a new poly tote and was sent onto the consignee. Once the damaged tote was transferred it was determined the the damaged tote leaked due to degradation to the bottom corner of the tote as the material was thin and flimsy compared to the other parts of the tote when the contractor cut the damaged tote up for pending disposal activities.,,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,12000,Sustain,US,

The content of the carboy was hydrogen peroxide (8-25% peroxide) (40%) with methanol (60%). The container was half full so approximately 2.5 gallons spilled. The damage to the drum was about a two inch split on the bottom of the container.   The Veolia employees placed absorbent granules on the spill and placed absorbent pad over the storm drain.  The material was swept up and then the entire area was pressure washed which the rinse water was vacuumed up and containerized for disposal.","Veolia EHS management reviewed the incident with the employees who packaged and shipped the material. A formal training was done on 10/27/2020 discussing the proper packaging requirements for materials that potentially may pressurize during transportation.

The car was isolated and  Advansix, Marathon Petroleum, Kentucky Division of Emergency Management and National Response  Center were notified CHEMTREC Report #2020-102700265. Quick Response, a CSXT response  contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a detectable vapor release coming from the  vacuum relief device (VRD). Upon further inspection it was found that O-ring gasket inside the VRD  was not sealing allowing vapor to escape the device. The issue identified and corrective actions  were communicated to the shipper Advansix, Larry Buffey 810-931-0280. Contractor personnel  removed the VRD and replaced it with a new VRD provided by Marathon Petroleum.

In the interest of Safety, the unit was placed into the containment area to be inspected.  On behalf of the shipper, Hazmat One was contacted and subsequently Ocean Blue was dispatched to complete inspection/remediation.  The contractor completed inspection/remediation at 02:30 10/26/20.  Interior inspection revealed palletized mixed freight varying in size and weight stowed 2 high throughout.  Unapproved use of a loadbbar was utilized as doorway securement with no signs of any lateral securement used within the load.  The source of the leak was found to originate in the middle of the unit.  The spilled product was determined to be Seagate Paint Coating (Synpex Flat White) carrying a Flammable marker UN 1263 in 5 gallon pails.  The cause of the spill was determined to be a result of the failed packaging due to the weight being applied from the second layer of palletized freight resulting in 2 pales to crush losing approximately 8 quarts of product.","Shipper should ensure that adequate blocking and bracing are in place to prevent shifting of the load during transport.

During the transfer operation,  it was discovered that approximately 8 ounces of material had escaped from the valve on the  container.  Driver immediately identified the leak and put spill containment down. Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to transfer liquid from damaged tote into new tote.  Additionally, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate were collected  and placed into the salvage drum.

Our driver was unable to maneuver to his left due to a car occupying that lane and was unable to maneuver to the right without overturning the truck.  Out truck struck the motorcycle.  Upon impact, he immediately saw flames that completely blocked his view but as he pulled over the flames began to subside.

As the driver was unloading the box from his truck, liquid escaped through the top of the roll-off box and the tarp that was secured to it to prevent pieces of dry product from flying out during transit. Approximately 10 or so gallons of liquid spilled from the box onto the blacktop. No drains, grass, soil, or waterways were affected by the spill. Everything was contained on the blacktop within Heritage property.  The spill was reported about 1:15 pm and an in-house Heritage Field Services crew were immediately dispatched to come and clean up the spill.  Both the onsite waste coordinator at U.S. Steel and driver failed to check the inside of the box for free liquids (which are not allowed).  This is the responsibility of both the onsite waste coordinator, who is responsible for ensuring that the waste containers are acceptable for transport, and the driver (driver should always check their load before transport). This liquid was most likely caused by rain getting through an unsecured corner of the cover tarp. Had either checked the container for liquid before transport, this incident would never have happened.",The onsite waste coordinator and the driver will both be counseled in addition to undergoing retraining on thoroughly inspecting both the outside and the inside of the boxes before shipment. There is also a checklist on the Stop Ticket that includes inspecting all roll-offs for liquids.  All affected Heritage employees will complete refresher training on the use of this checklist.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

Driver had stopped in Birmingham, AL. He had done a walk around(Circle of Safety) of his tractor and trailer and noticed nothing was happening at this time. He then drove to exit 322 off 65 north in Falkville, AL and stops at a truck stop at this exit. Once parked, driver gets out and does another walk around(Circle of Safety) when he notices product releasing from the pressure relief valve (PRV) from the top at the rear of the trailer. The driver immediately calls our Central Dispatch office to report the incident. Dispatch got the Terminal Manager& Safety on the call with the driver. Driver was instructed to call 911 and get immediate assistance to the scene. First responders, Hazmat crew,& several police agencies arrived on scene. Hazmat crew donned SCBA and started working toward getting the pressure relief valve to close. This step was unsuccessful. They then put some kind of putty in the hole to stop the release. This putty did stop the release of the gas to the atmosphere. The valve was watched to make sure the putty was going to hold. Release lasted approximately 4 hours from the time the driver noticed it until the Hazmat crew was able to plug the valve with the putty. It was discovered the PRV was bent not allow it to close once it popped to release the pressure. Valve was bent due to a baffle that had broke off during transit and hit the PRV bending it.·-",We removed all five trailer's running in this service for our customer to inspect the PRV on each trailer. We changed the schedule 80 stainless steel spray bar to 10 gage stainless steel. We changed the configuration of the baffles to keep them from coming apart and hitting the pressure relief valve. Replaced the BPS pressure relief devices with Marshall pressure relief devices.
