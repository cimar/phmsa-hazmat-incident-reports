As a result, approximately seven(7) gallons of phosphoric acid was released to the trailer floor. At approximately 4:59 am CST, a representative with R+L Carriers retained Cura Emergency Services, L.C.(CES) to manage the environmental remediation of the site on their behalf. Based on the available information, the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from Emergency Remediation Specialist(ERS) to asses and remediate the site as necessary. At approximately 8:35 am CST, a crew from ERS arrived on-site. Following a site assessment, ERS personnel noted approximately 7 gallons of phosphoric acid released to the trailer floor. Crews removed the damage container and deployed a nutralizing agent to the impacted area. Once the chemical was neturalized, ERS personnel deployed granular absorbents and worked them in using hand tools. All phosphoric acid impacted material was collected and containerized in three (3) 55-gallon poly drums for transport and disposal.

The driver was travelling on hwy 174 near Pell City Alabama when he encountered a car that was stopped (or appeared to be stopped) in the middle of the road. the driver of the truck tried to get the driver of the pick up truck's attention but to no avail.  steps to avoid the accident failed and the big truck clipped the smaller truck in the right rear and both vehicles overturned onto the road shoulder.  the trailer attached to the big truck was on its left side overhanging a small but active creek.  an untold amount of mineral oil and 10 gallons of pcb oil leaked into the creek before the truck and trailer could be up-righted.  the total amount of time that the oils dripped into the creek was approximately 2 hours.  A clean-up crew was immediately dispatched and they put out spill booms and other materials for a distance of approximately 4 miles in the creek and two vacuum trucks were brought in the help vacuum off the oils.",For the severity of the damage to the truck and trailer the transformers on the trailer held up well.  small openings in the covers on the transformers opened enough to allow some oil to drip out at a slow rate. The best way to insure that this would not occur in the future would be to insist that the transformers were completely emptied of oil before transporting and allow the oil to be shipped only in fully seal able and leak-proof containers.,No,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,325000,"Robbie D Wood, inc",US,

The drums  were strapped to the side wall of the truck using the e-track strap to secure the load. There were  no leaks reported by the individuals who loaded the drums. The following morning, on 1/8/2020,  the driver drove the trailer to the Veolia 10 day in-transit facility located in San Diego, CA, where it  would be off-loaded for subsequent delivery to the customer. Upon opening the trailer door, Veolia employees noticed liquid material on the floor of the trailer. Further investigation revealed one of  the drums was leaking. The Veolia employees overpacked the leaking drum into a salvage drum  and cleaned up the spill.  After examining the leaking drum, it was discovered that a portion of the  chime showed bare metal and appeared to be abraded from either being dragged or rubbed. The  shipper confirmed that these drums were brand new and there was no other damage aside from  the abrasion. Based on our understanding of the incident, we believe there were multiple factors that caused the spill. The drum may have had a compromised chime from the manufacturer, or the drum was improperly handled which abraded the chime; during transportation, the drum was  vibrating which cracked the chime and caused the release.","Based on the information, the drum should not have leaked due to normal conditions of transportation unless it was already compromised. Veolia will retrain its employees on inspecting drums prior to  shipment, especially regarding chimes and proper handling so that chimes do not become abraded or damaged during the handling process. One thing to note is that the drum did not show any other  damage such as a dent near or around the chime which leads Veolia to believe that this was a  possible manufacturer's defect.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

At approximately 12:51 AM CST, a representative for LSH retained Cura Emergency Services(CES) to manage the environmental remediation on their behalf. Based on the available information, the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from Lonestar Hazmat(LH) to assess and remediate the site as necessary. At approximately 2:03 PM CST, a crew from LH arrived on site and donned the proper personal protective equipment. The crew completed a site assessment and noted an unknown released liquid onto the wooden trailer floor. LH personnel tested the PH of the liquid and noted a PH of 5-6. After reviewing the bill of Iading, crews believed the characteristics of the unknown liquid resembled that of naphtha. LH personnel deployed granular absorbents to the released product and worked them in with hand tools. All spent absorbents were collected and containerized into one(1) bag.

THE PROCEDURE IS TO HOOK OUR 3 INCH BLACKMEAR PUMP TO THE LOW POINT DRAIN AND A 1 INCH LINE TO THE TOP VENT OF THE PUMP WE ARE PUMPING. THE PUMP IS HOOKED TO THE BOTTOM LOADER OF THE TRAILER AND THE VENT IS RAN INTO THE DOME LID ON TOP. THE PUMP IS STARTED AND THE DRIVER IS ON TOP TO VERIFY THE VENT IS WORKING AND THE PRODUCT IS FLOWING. WE HAVE A SIGHT GLASS ON THE BOTTOM LOADER TO MONITOR THE FUEL.  IT TAKES TWO HOURS TO FILL THE TRAILER. AT 15 MINUTE INTERVALS THE DRIVER GOES BACK UP TOP TO CHECK THE FLOW. AFTER GETTING ON TOP HE REALIZED THE TANK WAS ALMOST FULL SO WE SHUT OFF ALL THE VALVES ON THE TRAILER AND PUMP. THE DRIVER THEN TRIED TO REMOVE THE VENT LINE AND REALIZED THE VENT LINE WAS NOT FLOWING.THE VENT LINE SHUT OFF IS LOCATED IN A VAULT UNDERGROUND WHERE CONFINE SPACE PERSONNEL ARE REQUIRED TO BE.ALL CONFINE SPACE PERSONNEL HAD GONE TO ANOTHER VAULT. WE NOTIFIED THE ENGINEER AND HE DROVE DOWN TO THE VAULT WHERE THE PERSONNEL WERE AT AND HAD THEM GO BACK TO THIS VAULT.DURING THIS TIME (ABOUT 5 MINUTES) WE PUT TWO HALF DRUMS UNDER THE LATTER DRAIN AT THE END OF THE TRAILER BUT ONCE THOSE FILLED UP IS WHEN IT STATED TO OVERFLOW.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS NOTIFIED AS WELL AS THE AIRPORT OPERATION. THE AIRPORT ENVIRONMENTAL PERSON ARRIVED AND TOOK OVER THE SIGHT. AN AIRPORT VAC TRUCK ARRIVED AND IMMEDIATELY AND BEGAN VACUUMING AND STARTED THE CLEANUP. WE CLOSED UP THE TRAILER AND ALL OF OUR EQUIPMENT. THEY HAD US LEAVE AND TAKE THE REMAINING FUEL TO THE AIRPORT FUEL FARM.  LATER THAT DAY IT WAS DETERMINED THE FUEL FARM ATTENDANT HAD TURNED ON A VALVE THAT WAS NOT TAGGED AND LOCKED OUT LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. WHEN THIS WAS DONE IT RE-ENERGIZED THE LINE WE WERE PUMPING.,"THE NEW CHANGES ARE AS FOLLOWS: ENGINEERING, CONFINE SPACE PERSONAL AND JET STAR PERSONEL WILL HAVE TWO WAY RADIOS WHEN ANY PUMPING IS BEING DONE. ALL CONFINE SPACE PERSONEL WILL BE AT THE VAULT AT ALL TIMES WHILE PUMPING.

The manifold used by Univar Solutions to connect to the railcars was attached to the railcar (via a threaded connection) and a compressed air line was connected to the railcar via a separate connection. The railcar car was pressurized and when the switch was engaged to open the air actuated valve on the manifold to begin the acid flow, the manifold blew off the railcar connection. Note railcar GATX5617 is a top load/unload configured tank car, there are no bottom connections on this railcar. Once the manifold released off the car, the acid was pushed out of the tank car until the air pressure equalized with atmospheric pressure at which time the release ceased. No air, surface water, or ground water was impacted by the acid release to our knowledge.  A small area of soil adjacent to the rail spur of approximately 10-15 feet square was impacted by the release.  Univar Solutions mobilized an emergency response team to the release location and the impacted soil was scraped off using a skid steer excavator to a lined roll-off box which was staged to hold the soils pending profiling for proper disposal. The ground surface under and immediately adjacent to the rails is protected by a series of containment / collections pans.  According to East Penn representatives, these pans are plumbed to an underground stormwater collection and holding tank system.  The majority of the released acid was captured by the pans and drained to their self-contained underground stormwater collection / holding tank system.  The emergency response team pumped out the underground holding tank and collection pipes.  The inspection markings on the side of the railcar indicated this car was on the last year of its inspection / service life. An inspector from the Federal Railroad Administration visited the incident location on January 24, 2020 to observe the railcar. The condition of the threaded offloading connection (which is an integral component of the DOT specifications of the rail tank car) was observed to be suspect as the threads were significantly worn.","As a result of the incident, Univar Solutions reviewed our equipment and documentation. We are evaluating the use of a measuring device (e.g., micrometer) to evaluate the thread condition of the rail car and our manifold before we hook up to the rail car. We have also reviewed the condition of our manifold devices and replaced fittings on two of the manifolds. Lastly, Univar Solutions is evaluating alternative designs and materials of construction for the manifold devices used to connect to the rail cars. In addition, Univar Solutions has purchased a preventative maintenance program from the supplier of the acid transfer trailer to provide third party expert oversight in this process.",Yes,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,Univar Solutions,US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, Shell Chemical, was notified via CHEMTREC Report #2020-0126-00050.  Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched and found the source of the release was due to a faulty bottom outlet valve and an aged gasket which was preventing the bottom outlet valve’s secondary closure cap from containing the release.  MEI was able to install a new gasket in the secondary closure cap which stopped the release.  The issue’s identified and corrective actions were communicated to shipper’s representative: Mr. Shane Stuntz.  Shell Chemical obtained a One Time Movement Approval from the FRA and the car was delivered to industry for unloading without further product release.",(NAR code: 544 5 What Failed: Bottom Outlet Valve Where Failed: Connection between valve and tank car Why Failed: Mounting flange gasket deteriorated),No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2500,CSX Transportation,US,

As a result of the leak, approximately one-half gallon of UN1263 white paint was released to the trailer interior. At approximately 10:10 a.m. CST, a representative with R+L retained Cura Emergency Services, L.C.(CES) to manage the environmental cleanup of the site. Based on the available information, the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from TAS Environmental Services (TAS) to assess and remediate the site. TAS personnel arrived and assessed the site. Crews deployed absorbents pads to recover the release. Remaining paint stains on the trailer were treated with paint thinner and wiped down to remove as much staining as possible. TAS collected all impacted debris and four(4) boxes of impacted/damaged paint cargo. Each box contained two (2) half-gallon buckets of paint for disposal.

There ended up being lining damage to the hose from the tank washers putting the wand up in the hose to clean it out.  This is something we have conversations with our network of tank washes.  Being that the hose wasn't his we don't have definitive knowledge which tank wash caused the damage.  He had on his nomex suit, gloves, hard hat with face shield, goggles.

The operation was being conducted and attended by Hill Brothers Chemical Co. The operation was the evacuation of an anhydrous ammonia refrigeration unit in order to perform maintenance on the system. At the time of the evacuation operation it was unknown if the material would be stored on-site or transported off-site while the system was being worked on. No shipping papers were created at the time of the incident. Chemical Transfer Co's driver was not in charge of the actual loading operation as this operation was under Hill Brothers Chemical Co's personnel control.  After approximately 5 hours of operation the discharge hose from the compressor catastrophically failed at the hose end fitting. Initial thoughts are that the compressor was operated too long and overheated the hose at the fitting and caused the failure. Once the hose failed, the ammonia was released into the surrounding area both from the compressor discharge and through the cargo tank internal valve. General procedures are to have the internal valve closed and used as a check valve. Since Chemical Transfer was not conducting the loading operation we are not sure why the liquid internal was in the open position. As soon as the hose ruptured, the driver turned of the PTO and shut down the truck engine and exited the truck cab.  Once the cloud had moved away from the rear of the cargo tank, Chemical Transfer Co's driver was able to trip the rear remote which closed the internal valves. Vapor hose was hydro tested to 525 psi in Oct 2019, Hose removal date imprinted by Parker Hannifin on rubber 1-1-2022. Hose model is 1 inch 7262, max operating temp 180 def F, WP 350 PSI, NH3 service.","Rewrite all operational procedures. Install secondary check valve in the inline with the liquid internal valve. Utilize stainless steel braided hose from compressor to the delivery line with much higher allowable maximum operating temperature.  Install temperature gauge on compressor discharge outlet to monitor discharge gas temperature. Limit compressor operating time and allow cool down as required to ensure temperature do not reach maximum operating temperatures of hoses.

Driver Kimber Runyan dropped the unit off, discussed with the shop staff the installation requested and departed for the Ryder Repair shop in New Stanton to have a few minor repairs done.  A short while later he returned to the New Stanton shop to wait on the units to be completed.   At a point near noon, Driver Sean Randolph, an owner-operator leased to Grammer Logistics, 804-852-6005, dropped his trailer 877, also an MC331 tanker, for routine preventative maintenance.   As part of the routine maintenance procedure, a test is performed to check to see if there is pressure behind each dust cap at every hose connection point.  Trailer 235A failed this test.    As Mr. Runyan’s tractor repairs had been completed, he returned to pick it up.  After a short time, he returned to the Grammer Logistics repair shop. He was informed that his trailer had failed the leak test.  He hooked to it and re-parked it on the “back pad” at the rear of the shop, just to the left of the garage door.  He uncoupled and drove around to the front of the building.  He then went into the office and conversed with mechanic Ms. Jessica Noga.     Mechanic Mr. Andrew DeAngelo, a nine-year veteran employee here was on the back pad starting the “vent out” procedure necessary to relieve any pressure and vapors inside unit 235A.  This procedure requires opening valves and attaching a blower to blow normal air through the trailer.  It is unclear to myself and others as to the possible amount of butane vapors present at the ground level.  These vapors found an ignition source.  It is unknown exactly where Mr. Shawn Wilson was at this point but it is believed he was close to Mr. DeAngelo, as he would have been learning about this procedure as a newly hired technician.    First Fire Event   Inside the office, Mr. Runyan heard the rumble and felt the blast.  He pushed Ms. Noga to the office floor then the two ran out of the building **** (I do not know what door they left through)   As they were on their way to the Emergency Evacuation Rally point, Mr. Runyan saw Mr. DeAngelo engulfed in flames.  Mr. Runyan sprinted to his aid and put the flames out on Mr. DeAngelo’s clothing.  Mr. Wilson was also injured but managed to get a call for assistance to Westmoreland County’s Emergency Response Center.  Within minutes the first responding units arrived from Mutual Aid.    Second Fire Event    As Mutual Aid was assessing and treating the burn victims a second explosion occurred.  The source was not readily evident but footage from a news helicopter clearly shows a column of fire, well in excess of 30’, exiting the roof above bay #1 of the shop.   Mr. DeAngelo and Mr. Wilson were transported to UPMC Mercy, in Pittsburgh, via helicopter.",Grammer Logistics has improved operating procedures to prevent a recurrence.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,3,0,0,0,4,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,797000,Grammer Logistics,US,

The tanker was located on an uneven sloped asphalt surface that was unable to support the weight of the full tanker resulting in the asphalt to give way under the right landing gear and causing the tanker to tip over onto its side. Once the tanker rolled over, the dome cover lidlhad not been fully secured and product begin to leak out of the dome cover. Upon discovery of the rolled over tanker, Hasa responding employees immediately begin to mitigate the spill. The responders were able to capture the product Ieaking from the tanker int6 secondary containment containers and transferring product to 53 gallon drums. The responders noticed product was Ieaking directly from the dome, which was not fully closed. The dome cover lid bolts were tightened and no further product leaked from the dome. The tanker with the remaining product was lifted and uprighted with the assistance of two heavy duty tow trucks and secured with a tractor underneath the tanker. An inspection of the tanker was performed and there was no visible damage or leaks from the tanker and or the dome. Approximately 380 gallons were released from the tanker, with 330 gallons captured in secondary containment by responding employees. Thus, 50 gallons were released to soil which was recovered by third a party hazmat response company.","Additional training has been provided to all drivers and the following procedures have been implemented for parking loaded trailers or tankers to prevent a similar issue: - Loaded trailers/ tankers will be attached to tractor - If a loaded trailer/ tanker must be parked without a tractor, the following procedures are required: - Trailer/ tankers cannot be parked on sloped areas - Trailer/ tanker must be parked on hard concrete/ asphalt surface - Landing gear support pads must be under the landing gear legs of the trailer/ tanker i",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4100,23119 DRAYTON STREET,US,

Driver finished unloading compartment into UNL 2 and went to next compartment.  Driver overlooked that UNL 2 was 6k (nominal).  As second compartment finished unloading the overfill alarm went off.   Driver hooked back to UNL 1 to finish unloading trailer.  As driver was unloading into UNL 1 he noticed that product was spilling out of UNL 2 onto the surrounding concrete.  Driver stopped the unloading process and set out absorbent pads. The store called the Fire Department, which came out and set out some more absorbent pads and then left the scene.
