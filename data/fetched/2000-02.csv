PRIOR TO FILLING THE TANK WITH XYLENE, THE SWANSON RIVER OPERATOR ASKED THE CARLILE TRUCK DRIVER IF THE TANK HAD A VENT.  THE TRUCK DRIVER CLIMBED UP THE LADDER ON THE FRAME OF THE TANK, WALKED DOWN THE CATWALK, AND OPENED THE VENT HATCH. THE SWANSON RIVER FIELD SHIFT CHANGE OCCURRED WHILE THE TANK AND FILLING.
