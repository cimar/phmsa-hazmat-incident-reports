HE LOOKED @ THE OIL TANK THAT WAS LOCATED UNDER THE CUSTOMER'S DECK, IT WAS TIGHT AGAINST THE RAFTERS OF THE DECK AND THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK, INCLUDING THE OIL VALVE WAS NOT VISIBLE DUE TO BEING BURIED IN THE DIRT.  LEON DID NOT SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF AN OVERFILL. THERE WAS NO OIL ON TOP OF THE OIL TANK OR ON THE SIDES OF THE TANK. THE RAFTERS ABOVE THE OIL TANK, THAT WERE RIGHT AGAINST THE TOP OF THE OIL TANK, DID NOT HAVE ANY OIL ON THEM. LEON OFFERED TO REMOVE THE JUNK OUT FROM UNDER THE DECK TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE TO SEE WHAT WAS ACTUALLY LEAKING. THE CUSTOMER, AT THAT POINT, TOLD LEON NOT TO DO ANYTHING, THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A CONTRACTOR THAT THEY KNEW TAKE CARE OF IT. LEON CALLED THE SHOP REPORTING THAT THE OIL TANK ITSELF WAS LEAKING OR THE TANK VALVE WAS LEAKING BUT COULD NOT BE SURE BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER WOULD NOT LET HIM INVESTIGATE ANY FURTHER. WE REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE DEPT. OF THE ENVIRONMENT.  TO A LADY NAMED NANCY.  1-16-02- EASTERN PETROLEUM RECEIVED A CALL FROM NICK K., WHO IS WITH MDE, THAT HE WAS ON SITE AND HE SAW NO EVIDENCE THAT WOULD INDICATE AN OVERFILL. THERE WERE NO STAINS ON THE OIL TANK OR ANY FRESH OIL ON THE GROUND UNDER OR AROUND THE TANK. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS EVIDENT WAS THAT THE GROUND WAS OIL SOAKED .  HE STATED THAT BECAUSE HE COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE COULD HAVE CAUSED IT HE WAS REPORTING IT AS A OVERFILL. WE SENT LEON OUT TO MEET NICK. LEON ARRIVED ON SITE AND THE CONTRACTOR HAD ALREADY REMOVED DIRT AND TOLD NICK THAT HE HAD CLEANED OFF THE TANK. LEON TOLD NICK THAT WHEN HE HAD BEEN THERE ON 12/31/01 THERE WAS NO OIL ON THE TANK AND THERE WAS NO OIL ON THE DECK RAFTERS, WHICH THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE OIL CAME OUT OF THE VENT FROM AN OVERFILL. NICK AGREED BUT STILL SAID HE WAS WRITING IT UP AS AN OVERFILL. LEON TOLD HIM THAT THE OIL TANK VALVE THAT WAS IN THE DIRT COULD HAVE BEEN LEAKING FOR A WHILE, WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THE OIL SOAKED AREA WAS SO LARGE.  WE ALSO BROUGHT IN THE DRIVER THAT DELIVERED THE OIL ON 12-28-01. BOB S. HE STATED THE FOLLOWING: ""I MADE THE DELIVERY WITH NO PROBLEMS THAT DAY. I'VE BEEN TO THE HOUSE SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST .
