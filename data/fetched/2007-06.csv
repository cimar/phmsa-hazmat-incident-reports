During the daily inspection on June 1, 2007, it was discovered that a spill of approximately one quart of liquid sludge material containing 8-300 PPM PCB material had leaked to the ground.  The area was remediated and the roll-off container was sent to Veolia's Port Arthur Incinerator for immediate disposal.      ***NOTE: This material was shipped using the Polychlorinated biphenyls, solid, UN3432 shipping description however, UN3432 is not an available option when completing this online form.",Upon inspection it was determined that the leak was caused due to deterioration of an aging gasket on the rolloff container.

Carriers driver had to swerve to avoid hitting other vehicle head-on. The carriers tractors right front steer tire then left the pavement where there was no shoulder and a 10 foot drop off into a drainage ditch. Driver was unable to recorrect and keep the vehicle on the pavement. The carriers truck then went off the road, stuck a solid concrete embankment and came to a stop leaning at approximately a 45º angle into a drainage system. The Hazardous product that was being transported was violently shifted inside the van trailer causing 12 55gal. drums to rupture. Approximately 500 gallons product then escaped into the drainage system.    Carrier quickly mobilized environmental clean up teams local from the Oxnard area. Initial response was conducted by Black Gold Industries which immediately contained the release to keep it from spreading into the water system. They then pumped 8000 gallons of contaminated water into a recovery truck for disposal. Then ACTI was activated to perform major excavation to remove any residual material from the drainage system by removing the contaminated dirt and grass. After further review it was found that a high pressure natural gas line was present under ground and heavy equipment could not be used. ACTI then mobilized a large crew to manually dig up all contaminated soil. At this point Department of Fish and Game officers will be the final authorities and cleared the location. ACTI removed approximately 80 roll offs filled with contaminated soil and by products from the drainage system. 8000 gallons of contaminated water was pumped out of the drainage system and transported for disposal. As water run off continued to flow into the drainage system from unknown sources above the release area, it was pumped from a dammed up location to below the release area using a 150 gpm pump continuously during the clean up period.","This road is very heavily traveled by both private vehicles and commercial vehicles transporting all types of commodities. The road surface should be widened at this location, either by increasing the shoulder area or by paving an area on the shoulder. It was noted that on the opposite side there is approximitly 75 feet of gravel pull off. So improving the traveled area is an appropriate remedy. In addition it was noted there is a agricultural road that is frequently used and vehicles traveling south commonly make right hand turns onto this road. Several each hour.    The driver of the vehicle may have stayed in his lane of travel but the final outcome may have been a far greater loss to both property and life. This would have caused an impact with an oncoming private auto head on.",Yes,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,213000,SLT Express Way,US,

Following the application, Mr. Magg parked the nurse tank in the field driveway.  Later that day, a passerby noted a cloud of anhydrous ammonia vapor around the product valves located on top of the nurse tamk.  The Superior, Iowa Volunteer Fire Department responded to the release, along with the Dickinson County Sheriff's Office.  280th. Ave. was closed for approximately one hour while the Fire Department controlled the release.  The Fire Department sprayed 100 gallons of water fog on the ammonia vapor cloud.  This allowed the Firemen to approach the nurse tank and tighten the leaking vale, ending the release.  The entire release occured as a vapor release to the atmosphere.  No injuries or evacuations were reported with this release and at no time did any of the anhydrous ammonia contact the waters of the State.  Officials investigating the release attribute the cause to a large change in internal tank pressure, coupled with a loose product valve on top of the tank.  Afternoon temperatures in the area approached 92*  Evening temperature fell to about 62* at the time of the release.  Officials speculate that the temperature change and resulting internal pressure change on the nurse tank's contents were the leading causes of the release.  Fire Department personnel were able to end the release by hand tightening the leaking product valve.  No cleanup efforts were required as the entire release occured as a vapor to the atmosphere.  The small amount of water used to fog the ammonia cloud soaked into the soil of Mr. Magg's corn field.","Great Lakes Cooperative, the supplier of the anhydrous ammonia and the nurse tank, inspected the nurse tank following the release.  There was no damage found, or repairs needed, to the product valve.  Company employees will instruct all customers utilizing this equipment to make sure that all product valves are tight and secure before unhooking from the nurse tank.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,0,"Compass, Inc.",US,

Facility personnel immediately donned appropriate protective equipment and initiated appropriate response procedures.  Upon identification of the damaged container, it was determined that a 5 gallon polyethelene pail was placed between 2 larger containers.

While lowering the bin, the ratcheting mechanism used to tighten and hold the rear swing door secured, experienced a complete failure of material due to metal fatigue and corrosion and allowed the rear door to partially swing open.  Approximately 200 pounds of materials was released from the rear gate.  All of the released material was contained on a concrete pad.

At the time of the release, the bulk bin was being lowered from a transport vehicle onto a concrete storage pad at a less than 10-day storage facility operated by Clean Harbors Environmental Services (CHES) in Deer Park, TX.   While lowering the bin approximately 20 gallons of sludge material splashed over the rear gate of the bulk bin.  All of the released material was contained on a concrete pad.    Upon noticing the release, the driver swiftly lowered the bin onto the pad to bring it to a horizontal position and minimize the release.  Thereafter driver stopped all operations, evacuated the area and notified his supervisor.  An in-house response crew was dispatched and arrived at the seen shortly thereafter.  They retrieved and reviewed the shipping papers and determined that the material in the bulk bin was Hazardous Waste Solid, n.o.s. (Centrifuge material contaminated with Benzene) 9, NA3077, PGIII picked up earlier that day at Premcor Refining Group, Inc in Port Arthur, TX.  Please note that at the time the material was loaded into the sift-proof bulk bin it was classified as being solid; however, it appears that during the course of transportation a small liquid layer formed on the top of the load due to vibrations and compression.   When the bulk bin was tilted to be off-loaded, the liquid layer spilled over the rear gate of the bin.    After reviewing the shipping papers, the response crew utilizing appropriate personal protection equipment and company health and safety policies and procedures entered the containment pad and commenced the clean up operations.  All of the released material was collected using appropriate absorbent materials and placed into appropriate containers for future disposal at a permitted hazardous waste disposal facility.  The cover of the bulk-bin was opened and the load was inspected for presence of any additional liquid.  It was determined that no more liquid remained in the container and it could be safely loaded onto the roll-on/roll-off vehicle for further transportation to the adjoining disposal facility.      The bulk bin was loaded and transported to the facility designated on the shipping papers without any further incidents.","Our initial investigation concluded that the presence of liquid layer was either due to the waste material being pressed and settling during transportation and storage, or rainwater and condensate accumulating in the bulk bin.  The generator of this waste stream was contacted and informed of the incident.  They were also asked to address the preparation of this material for transportation and to ensure that no liquid material is added to this material prior to shipment.

The responder loosened the manway securement bolts to relieve internal pressure inside TILX 192658 and to check the product outage level.  Once the manway was opened, the PRD product release stopped. The product outage was less than two inches. All spillage evaporated.  The manway was resecured and TILX 192658 was carefully isolated in the railyard. The shipper was notified to make arrangements to off-load excess product in TILX 192658. On 6/13/07, excess product was transferred into a tanker truck without further incident.

Marathon-Ashland sent Rescar to the yard to inspect the car and found that it was ""weeping"" product from the flange adaptor on the bottom outlet cap. Rescar reported there was no actual liquid product drippage, just a wetness around the flange.  Rescar found that the nuts on the flange bolts were improperly torqued.

Upon opening the trailer door at the Roadrunner Dawes Freight Systems, Inc. facility, a leak was discovered.  Area was isolated and secured, pending arrival of outside contractor assistance.  NRC Environmental Services of Long Beach, California was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon inspection of the trailer, NRC Environmental Services determined that one 5-gallon poly drum was punctured by a nail inside the trailer.  Approximately 5 gallons of corrosive liquid, nos were released inside the trailer.  NRC Environmental Services applied absorbent material to the free liquid, which was containerized, along with the damaged drum, into two (2) 55-gallon recovery drums, pending disposal.  NRC Environmental Services proceeded to pressure wash the trailer floor, to remove any residual product, and containerized the wash water into one (1) 55-gallon drum.  Three (3) 55-gallon drums were transported by NRC Environmental Services to Crosby & Overton for disposal.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be related to a nail puncture during transit, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

RMCAT Environmental Services, Inc. applied absorbent material to contain the free liquid on the impacted asphalt surface.  RMCAT Environmental Services, Inc. investigated the trailer and discovered one, leaking 55-gallon drum.  Approximately 10 gallons of free product were released.  The leak was due to a faulty gasket on a bung.  RMCAT Environmental Services, Inc. applied additional absorbent material as needed to recover the free liquid inside of the trailer.  The leaking drum was placed into an 85-gallon over pack drum.  One, 85-gallon overpack drum containing the leaking drum and one, 55-gallon drum of contaminated absorbent material were generated as a result of the incident.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected BN 974392 finding product leaking at the blind flange to the liquid line valve. The responder reduced internal pressure inside BN 974392 by opening the secured manway cover. Once internal pressure was relieved, the product leak was stopped by 2305 hrs. PDT, 6/03/07. BN 974392 was resecured and carefully moved to the BNSF fuel unloading rack in the Spokane railyard. BN 974392 was fully unloaded without further incident. A BNSF environmental contractor was called and remediated all ground impact spillage. The side specification stencil on BN 974392 indicated that the tank qualification was completed in 2002 and due in 2012. Since the ambient high temperatures were in the 90 degree F range for the last week, it appeared that the combination of product expansion, rising internal pressure and possibly the incorrect product outage for these temperatures lead to the product release at the flanged closure.

The current shipper then reshipped the same item from a domestic location to another domestic location.  Normally, this would move as non hazardous since it is a new piece of equipment but the battery acid is not in the battery but rather is separately packaged to avoid the battery activation.  The current shipper should have shipped this as it was shipped to him but he did not.

Weyerhaeuser placed a call to Chemtrec (Report Number 2007061700029) and the shipper, Tronox, LLC was notified of the incident.  CSX Transportation contacted SWS Environmental to respond and secure the container as we were the last railroad to handle the car prior to the release.  Once on site, SWS representatives found the cause of the release to be four of four fill hole securement bolts / nuts being less than tool tight.  The bolts / nuts were properly tightened and the car was released to destination.  Approximately ten (10) gallons of sulfuric acid was released from railcar.

Further inspection by the train crew revealed that the coupler knuckle cart-wheeled under this flatcar striking the floor of intermodal container HDMU 228184 and then lodged under the flatcar. A small amount of product powder, estimated at one cup, was found on the platform of the intermodal flatcar under HDMU 228184, which contained 80 drums of imported (from China) powdered Vanadium Pentoxide. BNSF contract responders inspected HDMU 228184 finding a hole in the container floor (2 feet long by 1 foot wide). A 55 gallon steel drum directly above this floor hole had a 6-8 inch dent on the drum bottom, but no drum compromise could be seen. The contractor cleaned the small amount of spillage on the flatcar platform and wiped the coupler knuckle that was recovered. After the coupler knuckle was replaced, the train proceeded to Spokane, where the flatcar BNSF 231120 with the damaged container (HDMU 228184) was setout. HDMU 228184 was deramped for a complete interior inspection. On 6/19/07, the same response contractors unloaded the drums from HDMU 228184. During the drum unloading, several drums were noted with loose top drum lid retainer ring bolts and these were tightened with no product spillage incurred. Responders also found two 55 gallon drums (UN 1A2/X2/50S/07) that had been dented from the knuckle impact. One of these drums had a dime sized hole at the drum bottom in the dented area. When this drum was lifted, no product leaked out, but there was product on the container floor near this drum; and it was cleaned. The two dented drums were placed into 85 gallon overpack drums and properly labeled. All lading from HDMU 228184 was transferred into another intermodal container without further incident and forwarded to the consignee.",No additional comments.,No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8005,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Douglas St., El Segundo, CA. arrived at the branch. He heard a noise coming from the rear of the building and upon investigation he observed a cloud in the area of the 6500 gallon stand tank containing Oxygen, refrigerated liquid. Upon unlocking and opening the gate he observed that the sound and vapor cloud was coming from a pressure release valve. At that time there was a large accumulation of ice around the valve and a small amount on the concrete under the tank. There was no liquid present.    Upon securing safety equipment he went to the valve and was able to force it shut.  He then called the Warehouse Supervisor advising him to respond to the branch. While waiting he secured the perimeter around the stand tank.    It was determined that on 6-4-07 they had received a delivery of Oxygen, refrigerated liquid from Air Gas, Vernon, CA. At that time the tank had been filled. Examination found that approximately 31” or 527 gallons had been released.    A technician from Cryotech, VBS International, Anaheim, CA responded to their request to inspect and repair the tank. The technician found that both burst discs and the pressure release valve had failed. The necessary repairs were completed. The technician advised that it was probable that when the delivery was made it was conducted at high pressure and that was the cause of the failures.    Air Gas was notified of the incident.","Air Gas has been requested to remind their drivers that the pressure during fills must be made at the proper pressure. This is a low pressure tank and filling it at an excessive pressure will damage the tank and creates a hazardous condition.    Apria staff have been instructed that if a fill is conducted during business hours that they are to verify the fill pressure being utilized.

A small leak was noticed through the trailer in which this material was loaded and was awaiting further transportation to its final destination.  Immediately upon discovery action was taken to mitigate the release by using oilsorb material to prevent the spread of the release. The container had leaked approximately less than 1 gallon of liquid on the trailer floor. A pinhole leak was observed on the outer body of this metal drum.  The drum was carefully placed on its side with the pinhole facing up and was packed into a ""SALVAGE"" container, an 85 gallon poly overpack.  The spilled material on the floor of the trailer was cleaned up using oilsorb, rags and was decontaminated as well.","This leak was the result of combining various solvents that are believed to hold corrosive properities which contributed to the container failure.  It is very important to ensure appropriate containers are used for the chemicals being packaged even though this was an authorized container under the DOT packaging standards for the hazard class and the proper shipping name.

Shortly thereafter it began exploding Li-ion cells one at a time in a thermal runaway and catching fire.

Passengers cleared the immediate area of the gate where the fire occured but the building is a ""satellite"" type of layout with a common area containing about 6-8 gates.  The entire area was not evacuated as it is a large seating area.  Passengers waiting to board the flight simply moved away from the immediate area.

During the course of transportation, the shipment was stored in-transit for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities into a van trailer for continuing transportation.  Upon arrival at Clean Harbors in-transit facility located at 211 Holiday Avenue in Cannon Falls, MN; facility personnel detected a solvent odor coming from the rear door of the straight box truck.  Facility personnel donned appropriate personal protective equipment and entered the trailer.  It was determined that a pinhole leak had developed in the side wall of one of the 55 gallon closed head steel drums containing waste paint.  It is estimated that approximately 16 ounces of material had escaped to the floor of the trailer and approximately 2-3 ounces escaped onto the asphalt parking area.  Facility personnel placed the damaged container into a suitable salvage drum and cleaned up all released material using a suitable absorbent material.  This material was placed into the 85 gallon salvage drum and was sent for disposal to the fully licensed waste management facility identified on the shipping paper.","At the time of loading, the containers were inspected and no evidence of leaking was detected.

PROX 89497 was immediately cordoned off in the railyard, but later after the chlorine odor subsided, it was moved and isolated in the railyard. BNSF contract responders inspected PROX 89497 and reported finding two loose mounting flange stud nuts at the base of the B-end liquid line valve. Responders tool tightened these loose flange nuts four complete turns each which ended any further chlorine vapor release. Responders also checked all the other valves and found at least two loose flange stud nuts on the other valves, which were also tool tightened. Securement was completed by 0230 hrs. CDT, 6/06/07 and PROX 89497 was released to proceed to its destination.   At approximately 0630 hrs. CDT on 6/12/07 at the BNSF Alliance (Haslet, TX) railyard, a BNSF switch crew reported a chlorine odor emanating from PROX 89497. PROX 89497 was cordoned off. A BNSF contract responder inspected PROX 89497 finding a small leak at the B-end liquid valve flange above the pressure plate. The mounting flange stud nuts were tool tight. The contractor applied and secured a chlorine capping kit which ended the product odor by 1010 hrs. CDT, 6/12/07. PROX 89497 continued to be monitored by this Chlorep approved contractor. Movement approval FRA-07060175 was obtained to move PROX 89497 to a closer consignee location in Cleburne, TX for unloading. PROX 89497 arrived at the consignee location at Cleburne without further incident.

As he was driving the driver noticed an ammonia leak coming out the back of his truck.  The driver immediately pulled his truck to the side of the road to investigate the leak.  When the driver got to the back of his trailer he noticed that the 1"" hose came loose and was rubbing on the ground.  A hole was rubbed into the hose allowing the ammonia in the hose to leak out.  The duration of this leak was about two minuets. The hose was iolated from the main tank by a block vlave, so only the product in the hose was released.  It is very hard to determine how much liquid ammonia was in the hose because most of the liquid is removed at the time of delivery.  It is a strong posiability that there was only vapor in the hose at the time of the leak.  The locking nut on the hose real apparently loosened allowing the hose to fall to the ground.  A new hose real will be installed.","Because of the block valves between the tank and the hose, this release was minimized.  A new hose real will be installed and the locking nut will be inspected daily.

The Shipper had put approximately 1000 gallons into the trailer before the leak was discoviered. The product was taken back off of the trailer and a different trailer was loaded in its place. It was later deteremined that the QRB valve was where the product was leaking.,The trailer was washed and inspected and it was determined that the teflon gasket in the QRB valve was the cause of the leak. The teflon gasket was replaced and the trailer was pressure tested and found to be in good condition and no longer leaking.

When the meter stop was reached, the operator started the transfer back up and loaded more into the car, mistakenly thinking there was room in the car for all the chemical in the tank.  The operator did not use a redundant means of overfill protection, (required for all ""closed system"" loads).  THe car overfilled and 600 gallons for Dichloropropene was released into a contained area.  Water spray was used to suppress vapors and the chemical was washed to a closed wastewater system.  The duration of the actual release was about 5 minutes, adn all material was washed into a closed system adn vapor suppressed in 30 minutes after release.  Actual release to the environment consisted only of material that vaporized to the atmosphere, adn was calculated to be ~77 pounds.","Retraining for the two operators involved in this event.

As a result of the collision with a passenger automobile, the truck and the trailer rolled over onto a graveled section of a parking lot of an adjoining business northbound on highway 23.  At the time of the collision, the truck was transporting approximately 4,100 gallons of Hazardous Waste Liquid n.o.s. (Benzene) 9 NA3082 PGIII material.  As a result of the roll over, the pipes connecting the scrubber assembly on the tanker truck were fractured and began slowly seeping liquid materials onto the roadway and the graveled section of the parking lot.  Hoxie fire department, ambulance, and police were on the scene of the accident within minutes.  The fire department deployed spill containment equipment to prevent the waste material from entering any waterways or contaminating larger area.  Both the driver of Clean Harbor’s vehicle and the driver of the passenger vehicle were transported to the Sheridan County Hospital by ambulance and later transferred by air to Wesley Medical Center in Wichita, KS.  Clean Harbors driver was treated for non-life threatening injuries and released after 3 days, the condition of the other driver is unknown at this time due to patient confidentiality laws.  Due to Clean Harbor’s driver’s injuries, Clean Harbors was notified of the event by Sheridan County Sheriff’s Department at 1910 EST.  Clean Harbors immediately dispatched a subcontracted emergency response provider in the area to respond to the scene.  Because of the approximately 2 hour mobilization time required for the ER provider to arrive on the scene, Sheridan County Emergency Management coordinator decided to transfer the material from the leaking tanker into a compatible tanker to avoid any catastrophic release.  The material was transferred and Clean Harbors truck and trailer up-righted without any incidents.  The duration of the release was approximately 4 hours from the time of the roll-over, until the material was transferred and the vehicles up-righted.  Concurrently, Clean Harbors dispatched an empty tanker truck to the scene to remove the waste material from the tanker truck used by the Sheridan County emergency management agency.  The waste material was transferred into the tanker dispatched by Clean Harbors, and the material transported to the waste disposal facility without any further issues.  The emergency response company contracted by Clean Harbors commenced remediation activities at the site of the accident.  All spill containment material, the contaminated gravel and soil was removed and placed into appropriate containers for future disposal at permitted hazardous waste facility. Upon completion of the remediation, soil samples were collected from the site and analyzed to ensure that no contamination was present.  Upon satisf","Clean Harbors is continuing investigating this accident and working with the driver, the witnesses and the Hoxie, KS police department.  Upon finalization of the management team investigation, the appropriate actions will be taken to prevent recurrences of such an event.",Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,267400,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

After everything was checked the driver asked the customer was he ready for him to pump product from the tanker.  The customer told the driver that everything was ready and to start pumping.  The driver opened the tanker valves and the valve on the customer's line at the point where the hose was connected.  The driver started the truck pump.  Immediately after engaging the truck pump the hose separated from the banded female camlock fitting.  The driver immediately stopped the pump.  All valves were closed immediately.  No personnel reported any product splashed on them.  Product was confined in the customer's containment.  The customer cleaned up the spill material.  The customer found the secondary valve on their bulk line had still been closed.  The driver used another hose to reconnect the tanker to the customer's bulk line.  The customer made sure that all valves on their line were open.  The driver opened the valves on the tanker and pumped the load without any further incident.  Hose test certification was reviewed.  Hose inspections were reviewed.  No negative information was noted.  All hoses were annually tested and passed at 225 PSI 01/08/2007.  The hose and fitting was inspected by the Branch Operations Supervisor, Tank Farm Leadman, and hose supplier representative.  It was noted that the two banding clamps on the outside of the hose were positioned directly above the two raised grip ridges on back bonding section of the camlock fitting.  This would allow the fitting the possibility of slipping out the hose.  Investigation determined cause as hose coupling failure.",Hoses were inspected for band positions.  Supplier initiated internal review of bonding process and performed an additional inspection of hoses.

The cause of this derailment was attributed to a gapped switch point at the siding switch. One of these derailed tank cars, TILX 190946 (DOT 111A100W1), derailed leaning and collided with the lead locomotive on a BNSF train stopped on the main track at the clearance point. This side collision sheared-off the liquid and vapor valves atop TILX 190946, as well as, damaging (crushing) the pressure relief device (PRD). Product from TILX 190946 escaped from the valve orifices and the PRD. The valve orifices were plugged which stopped the product release. Product drips continued from the damaged PRD until TILX 190946 was uprighted. Ground spillage was remediated.

The trailer was leaking from the number 2 compartment dome lid and was contained by the driver with the spill kit from the trailer. I spoke to US Environmental Services who were on site and in charge of clean up and they stated that the test results from the ground came back negative.

Acid ran up the 1-inch vapor srubber line and down into the scrubber tank. The sulfuric acid blended with the scrubber (hydrogen peroxide and water) solution in the scrubber tank. This created a violent reaction. Once this happened the loader shut down the rack immediately upon seeing steam boiling from the scrubber unit.  The plastic srubber tank melted from the heat of the chemical reaction and approximately 150 gallons of a diluted spent sulfuric acide mixture spilled onto the ground. Daming and diking was implemented to prevent acid from migrating off-site. Soda Ash was used to neutralize the diluted solution on the ground. CURA was notified and a HAZMAT response team was dispatched. The HAZMAT team arrived within the hour to begin cleaning and disposing of the contaminated material.,1) All customer service reps were retrained on checking the inventory sheet against the computer system before a sulfuric acid load is sent to a railcar.    2) Verifying employee must physically watch the loader open the dome lid of railcar to confirm there is adequate room in the railcar for product before loading.    3)High Level alarms will be used on all sulfuric acid railcars to alert loader if the railcar is being overloaded.    4) Develop specific work instructions for loading spent sulfuric acid in Philadelphia.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10982,Kinder Morgan Materials Services,US,

The fire caused the containers inside the trailer to melt, and some of the containers fell out of the onto soil after the walls of the trailer burned.  After the fire was extinguished, the containers that were on soil and some of the soil that was impacted were placed in rolloff boxes.

The pallet which the HM material was on was easily able to move in the trailer during transit. This caused the pails to shift and hit each other causing the leak. There was a puncture at the bottom of one of the pails which is where the paint leaked out. By the time the spill wasfound the paint was dry and the leaking had stopped. The pail with the hole in it was put in a recovery drum with the remains of the dry paint.,The loader of this shipment needs to be more careful when putting freight into trailers.

I, Russ Simons, examined the tote and found no visible damage to the tote but noticed that the valve would drip every minute or so. We placed the tote in a trailer by its self with absorbant to catch the drippings. I could not find any other damage to the tote. After examining the tote, I called Mike Sorensen, the safety manager, he instructed me to call the shipper's emergency contact number for further assistance. Delaval was contacted and made aware of the spill and they suggested a hazmat team come in and transfer the contents to another tote. At this point i turned the handling of this over to Katie powell the OS&D Clerk who handles these issues.","My recommendation to prevent this spill from reoccurring would be to have the valves which are made of plastic, be inspected, even/time the corrosive contents that it carries are dispensed, to make sure that the valves seals and mechanics are not compromised by the corrosive liquid.",No,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

Dean Cooper, Manager, Hazardous Materials, was notified and advised he would have Transloading Environmental enroute to investigate. While off loading the non hazardous drums, located one drum identified as Stepanquat 65NF, with Corrosive andFlammable markings, that was leaking. The drum was positioned against the left sidewall, three rows from the nose. The poly drumhad been crushed from adjacent drums shifting Into it during transit. A two inch crack on the bottom radius of the drum was the sourceof the leak. There was no floor damage to cause the crack in the drum, which indicates the drum may have been dropped duringloading. Estimated 30 gallons of product was lost during transit. The damaged drum was patched and placed into a salvage drum forsecurement. The other three hazardous drums were eventually located and found to be intact. The residue was cleaned from theflooring, and the drums, along with the salvage drum, were placed back into the on'ginal container.

Manager Cooper advised the release was discovered during the switching of an interchange cut, and the tank car had been moved to the RIP track, where it can be isolated. Manager Cooper further advised ACTI, the railroad’s hazmat contractor, would be dispatched to investigate. At 06:O8PM, Manager Cooper advised the ACTI contractor reported approximately seven gallons of material had sprayed across the top of the tankcar, and the release appeared to be from the manway. Manager Cooper advised the material did not reach the ground. He further advised repairs and car cleaning would occur on 06/29/07 during daylight hours. Inspection found one of the eight manway swing bolts loose on the forward edge of the manway. The manway gasket was distorted and pushed out at the loose bolt, apparently caused by product liquid surge during switching operations. The inverted ‘J’ type manway gasket was so distorted it could not be reused. A temporary gasket was made with Gore-Tex 1/2 inch joint sealant to secure the manway. ACTI cleaned the residue from the surface of the car, and it was relapsed for movement onto the consignee.",PROPER SECUREMENT OF CLOSURES.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2736,UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD,US,
