PRIOR TO THE INITIAL OFF LOADING OF THE WASTE CONTAINED IN THE TRAILER, THE TANK TRAILER WAS SITUATED IN A CONTAINMENT AREA CAPABLE OF HOLDING SPILLS UP TO 23,683 GALLONS.  THE TANK TRAILER WAS CHOCKED PRIOR TO OFFLOADING.  NITROGEN GAS WAS BEING METERED INTO THE TRAILER AS IT WAS OFF LOADED, SO THAT AN INERT ATMOSPHERE WAS MAINTAINED IN THE TRAILER HEADSPACE.  VALVES ON THE TANK TRAILER WERE OPENED SO THAT WASTE CONTAINED IN THE TRAILER WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE UNLOADING LINE AND PUMPS IN PHASE I. THE WASTE IN THE TRAILER WAS BEING PUMPED THROUGH A HOSE INTO THE UNLOADING LINE AND PUMP IN THE PHASE I TANK FARM FOR STORAGE AND EVENTUAL INCINERATION.  SHORTLY AFTER PUMPING OF THE WASTE INTO PHASE I BEGAN, THE TANK TRAILER ROLLED FORWARD, OVER THE TIRE CHOCKS AND PARTIALLY OUT OF THE CONTAINMENT AREA.  THE FORCE OF THE TANK TRAILER MOVING FORWARD RIPPED THE HOSE FROM ITS CONNECTION WITH THE UNLOADING LINE AND PUMP IN PHASE 1. HOWEVER, THIS HOSE REMAINED CONNECTED TO THE TANK TRAILER, ALL OF THE VALVES ON THE TRAILER REMAINED OPEN, AND NITROGEN WAS STILL BEING METERED INTO THE TRAILER HEADSPACE. SINCE THE HOSE WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE PHASE 1 TANK FARM UNLOADING EQUIPMENT, AND THE VALVES ON THE TANKER WERE OPEN, WASTE LIQUID IN THE TRAILER  SPILLED OUT OF THE HOSE AND ONTO THE ADJACENT GROUND.  THE TRAILER CONTINUED TO MOVE FORWARD AFTER THE SPILL BEGAN, STOPPING AT THE LIP OF THE CONTAINMENT AREA.  AS THE TRAILER MOVED FORWARD, THE CONTENTS SPILLING OUT OF THE HOSE WERE RELEASED INTO FOUR MAIN AREAS: THE CONCRETE CONTAINMENT SURFACE OF THE TANK FARM UNLOADING AREA, THE TANK FARM PHASE I PUMP PAD, THE ASPHALT ROADWAY EAST OF THE TANK FARM PHASE I AREA, AND ON TO THE SOIL/GRAVEL AREA ADJACENT TO THE SOUTH EAST SIDE OF THE TANK FARM PHASE I AREA.  APPROXIMATELY 500 GALLONS OF WASTE LIQUID WERE SPILLED/  THE TANK FARM OPERATOR RESPONSIBLE FOR OFF LOADING THIS TANK TRAILER RESPONDED QUICKLY WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. AT FIRST HE MISTAKENLY THOUGHT SOMEONE WAS DRIVING THE TANK TRAILER OUT OF THE AREA, SO HE RADIOED FOR THE DRIVER TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  WHEN THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE VEHICLE, HE RAN TO THE CAB TO STOP THE TANK TRAILER.  AFTER THE VEHICLE STOPPED, HE CLOSED THE WASTE UNLOADING VALVES ON THE TRAILER.  AT THIS TIME, PART OF THE TRAILER WAS OUT OF CONTAINMENT, AND THE WASTE UNLOADING VALVES WERE DAMAGED.  SINCE THE VALVES WERE DAMAGED, EVEN THOUGH THE OPERATOR CLOSED THEM, A SMALL AMOUNT OF WASTE CONTINUED TO TRICKLE OUT OF THE DAMAGED VALVES.  THE TANK FARM OPERATOR NOTIFIED THE SHIFT SUPERVISOR OF THE INCIDENT.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE WIND WAS PREDOMINANTLY BLOWING OUT OF THE EAST FROM THE SPILL AREA TOWARDS THE LABORATORY PORTION OF THE FACILITY.

THE FLOORING HAD BEEN COVERED WITH 1/2 INCH PLYWOOD, WHICH ELEVATED THE FLOOR HEIGHT ABOVE THE SIDEWALL FRAMES OF THE CONTAINER.  THIS ALLOWED THE DRUMS TO MOVE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE FLOOR FRAME AND NEST INTO THE CORRUGATED SIDE WALL WHEN LOADED.  THERE WAS SIDEWALL SECUREMENT 'D' RING WELDED TO THE FLOOR FRAME, RECESSED INTO THE CORRUGATION, THAT THE DRUM RESTED AGAINST.  DURING TRANSIT, THE BOTTOM CHIME OF THE DRUM RUBBED AGAINST THE 'D' RING, WHICH CAUSED METAL LOSS TO THE CHIME IN 2 PLACES, AND A STRESS CRACK DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE 2 ABRADED AREAS.
