The movement of the hose, coupled with the very low ambient temperatures, caused a crack to form in the CPVC elbow at the cargo tank inlet.  In addition, the primary tank closure valve (""internal"" valve) failed to seal completely, allowing the passage of material into the elbow and out through the crack.  Three cracks formed in the elbow proper along the rearward-facing vertical run of the elbow (see photos).  Vacuum was applied to the tank vessel to retain the material until a suitable trailer could arrive on-scene for transfer of the material.","Following discussion with the trailer and valve manufacturers, additional support and isolation brackets are being added to the trailer of similar design in the transporter's fleet, and a modification of the valve control system is being retrofitted so as to provide for positive physical closure of the primary valve in addition to the ""fail-safe"" spring closure system.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10000,"SJ TRANSPORTAION CO., INC.",US,

Everything was placed in a salvage container for later disposal.,The spill occured because the dockworker failed to load the container with orientaion arrows facing up.

Although the waste was a solid, from a filter press, some liquid had over time accumulated and leaked through a portion of the bag.  The leaked material was contained in the secondary containment pallet tray.  CTI, a HAZWASTE contractor, was called in and they repacked the waste into a Triwall container.

Engineer and Engineer trainee in trailing unit, CSX 8077).  The engineer trainee failed to stop short of coupling, allowing short-nosed end of CSX 75 to couple to the draft of cars at an excessive speed.  Impact causing the engineer to strike his head inside the locomotive, requiring hospitalization (10 stitches, treated and released).    CSX 75 impacted A-end coupler of tank car GATX 17801, load Isopropyl Acetate, 3, UN 1220, II.  Impact forced the outboard end of A-end draft sill of GATX 17801 down, and inboard end of the A-end stub sill up, denting into the shell of the car.  Initial impact noted to have caused a leak from underneath the tank car's breadbox, housing the optional loading/unloading fittings.  REACT personnel arrived on scene at approximately 11am, and placed a containment trough under the middle of the car to contain leaking product that was cascading down the sides of the car from the bread box area (ultimately capturing approximately 5 gallons of product).  After the Carteret (NJ) Fire Department sprayed a sporadic layer of foam under the car, REACT personnel were permitted to access the car in an attempt to inspect and initiate possible securiement of leak.  Their inspection found all four (4) liquid line mounting flange securement nuts less then hand tight.  One nut was noted to be approximately 4-5 threads unsecured.  The minimal internal pressure was released to atmosphere by opening the air valve.  Once the pressure was released (in less than 1 minute), the leak ceased.  REACT tool tightened all four liquid line mounting flange securement nuts tool tight.        Due to the damage to GATX 17801 caused by the impact, the car was transferred on site.  Utilizing four (4) highway cargo tanks furnished by the ultimate customer, AllChem (for Kinder Morgan), a total of 145,660 lbs (20,063 gallons) was transferred.  Transfers began at 5:05pm, and concluded at 9:45pm.  Estimate approximately 10-20 gallons remain in the car and will be retrieved while cleaning and purging the car on a later date at Conrail's Port Reading, NJ yard.  Awaiting disposition on car whether it will be sent Home Shop for repairs, or scraped (on-site).","As examined, it appears that, regardless of the handling and damaged caused by railroad handling, the car would not have released product (reported to be approximately 15 gallons prior to containment under the car) had the tank car's liquid line valve mounting flange securement nuts been appropriately secured in accordance with Sections 107.601(a)(6), 171.1(b)(4,11), 173.1(b), 173.24(a)(1), (b)(1,2), 173.31(d)(1)(ii,iii,iv), (d)(2) of CFR Title 49.  While the transfer of the remaining contents shipped in the car that ensued was resultant from the damage during Conrail's handling, the exhaustive and extensive emergency response by local, state and federal authorities could have been reduced and/or negated had there not been an emergency environment due to the release of a hazardous material.",No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1503,Consolidated Rail Corporation,US,

HOWEVER, WHILE THAT AMOUNT OF FUEL MAY BE A RELATIVELY LOW RISK FOR VEHICLES, 500 ML OF FUEL IN A SMALL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT SUCH AS A CHAINSAW IS AMPLE TO CAUSE A SPILL WITHIN THE PACKAGE WHILE IT IS IN TRANSPORTATION UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE EXCEPTION IN 173.220(G)(1).  THIS INCIDENT SUGGESTS THAT REQUIREMENTS TO COMPLETELY DRAIN THE FUEL TANK MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR SMALL EQUIPMENT THAT COULD BECOME INVERTED IN TRANSPORTATION, SINCE SPILLED GASOLINE CAN LEAD TO FIRES.",No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,UPS,US,

Approximately 10 gallons of free product were released and impacted the trailer and asphalt underneath the trailer. Apparently the release was due to a small hole on the bottom corner of the drum.  Bellon Environmental Company of Saint Louis, Missouri was dispatched to secure the leaking drum and perform the cleanup.  Bellon Environmental Company neutralized the free liquid and applied absorbent material to recover.  The contents of the leaking drum were transferred into a new drum, which will be returned to the shipper.  The cleanup materials were placed into one (1) 55-gallon drum for disposal.

CELLUCCI,"VICE PRESIDENT, TRANSPORTAITON COMPLIANCE",42 Longwater Drive,Norwell,MA,02061,Carrier,"Clean Harbors Aragonite LLC offered a shipment of incinerator slag for transportation in a non specification bulk bin.  At the time of loading, the driver inspected the container and all closures were in place and there was no evidence of leaking.  Upon arrival at the intended waste management facility, it was discovered that a clear liquid was leaking from the rear closure of the container.  Facility personnel immediately contained the release and absorbed all free liquids with a suitable absorbent.  In addition, additional absorbent was placed in the container to absorb any remaining free liquid that was visibile.  Once the laod was secured and the leak addressed, the container proceeded diretly to the off-loading area where the material was unloaded and processed for treatment and disposal.  All material generated in conjunction with the clean-up was disposed of at this location.  Please note that upn a detailed inspection, it was discovered that one of three bottom latches on the box was broken and it is believed that the abscence of this devise allowed a small amount of condensation to escape from the bottom seal.","At the time the shipment was offered for transportation no evidence of residual liquid or damage was observed.  It is believed that two separate conditions exisiting that contributed to this release.  When loaded, the incinerator slag is hot and is routinely stored for a period of time prior to transportation.  It is during this time that the material cools dowm.  It is believed that once the tarp was placed over the container, condensation developed due to the continued cooling of the material.  This condensation migrated to the bottom closure where it escaped through the bottom closure.  The second condition that we believe contributed to the release was a borken latch.  It is believed that the driver failed to identify this deficiency during his pretrip inspection.    In order to prevent a recurrence, the driver has been retrained to ensure that a comprehensive inspection is conducted of both the container and the lading and that any deficient discovered is addressed before accepting the shipment for transportation.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc.",US,

Pail on top was leaking inside of tightly shrunk wrap pallet. Investigated pro number and found itwas taken off of pup number 317-6619 which was breaking in door 69. Found DSR Donna Algar who breaking the load, and asked her if she noticed the damage tothe pail. She replied, she did not, so I walked her over to the pail. I told her to write it up damaged. It appears the pail was leaking during transit from XTM from the splatter of paint that appeared on the 50 gallon drum and another pail that was attached to the PLT that had dry paint on them. Plus, there was a good puddle already forming on top of bottom pail. The pail was dented on the inside facing the 50 gallon drum which caused a crimp and hole where the leaking was coming from. After calling both Linehaul and Chemtrec. I continued clean up by placing 5 gallon pail in small salvage drum and cleaned up the spill from the top of pail that was below the damaged pail. Placed salvage drum in OS&D.","Where you are able to do so, suggest or describe changes (such as additional training, use of better packaging, or improved operating procedures) to help preventrecurrence. Provide recommendations for improvement to hazardous materials transportation beyond the control of your individual company. Continue on additional sheets if necessary.I believe the pail was hit by other freight being loaded and the DSR loading probably not knowing there was damage done. There was no physical damage to outside of pail that was against shrink wrap, and there was no damage to the shrink wrap itself. The pallet was very tightly shrinked wrapped and the unloading DSR claimedthat there was dunnage around the shipment before it was unloaded from the trailer. Possible cause of damage could have been the freight being pushed against the plywood while loading causing the pail to get pressed into the 50 gallon drum causing dent and crimped hole, causing a very small leak.",No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CON-WAY FREIGHT,US,

After removing some of the pallets, our staff noticed fluid on the aircraft floor and on PMC96551CX loaded in position HL.  Because of the strong smell our staff made the decision to evacuate the aircraft immediately.  The fire department was immediately notified.  And although we made several trials to contact the FAA, we were not able to do so until early morning on the 18th.                                                                              Because the incident occurred inside the aircraft, the Fire Department was not involved in the cleaning.  Instead a private company, Hulcher Services Inc., was hired to contain, clean and dispose of any toxic materials.             The shipment in reference was unloaded from the aircraft and each drum was checked for leakage.  Two drums were found to be leaking and were disposed off in a special container later collected by the Hazmat company.  Both drums had structural damage caused by too much weight placed on top of them.  Fissures were small and almost not noticeable.",Our headquarters in HKG is currently reviewing this case and will notify us of their findings.

While monitoring the transfer, the loader observed product escaping from the hose. The transfer was immediately stopped and the situation investigated. The loader found that the cause of the product release was a compromised section of hose located underneath the protective sleeve used to prevent abrasions to the hose from dragging on the ground. A spill pan was immediately put into place and sand was applied to the area to contain the product that was released. The hose was replaced immediately.

At that point the AZ DPS became involved, the problem was that other Transpiration Companies were hauling out of the same location beside B.J. Cecil Trucking, Inc. which made it hard to determine who had the spill.  It was determined from the outbound scale tickets by the AZ DPS that it was either B.J. Cecil or Bulk Carriers.  B.J. Cecil went ahead and ordered the clean up through Environmental Response, Inc., 2202 W. Medtronic Way, Suite 108, Tempe, AZ 85281. B.J. Cecil’s suspected truck was contacted and the driver insisted that he had did his safety checks and there was not leaks.  But the next day after the unit had delivered that load and came back to the terminal that there was residual evidence on the rear on the trailer that this unit had cause the spill.  We think the driver had not securely closed the dome lid to prevent a leak.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at Clean harbor's in transit storage yard located in Bristol, CT.  During this stop, a load check was performed and a 1 gallon release of material was identified from one of the containers.  Facility personnel immediately activated the internal emergency reposne action plan which included an evacuation of the specific loading dock where the truck was parked, notification of local and state officials and dispatch of an emergency response team.  Upon arrival, the containers were inspected and it was discovered that a small pinhole developed on the bottom of one of the containers. It is beleived that the structural integrity of the container was compromised due to the presence of rust.  The emergency response team placed the damaged container into a suitable slavage drum along with all material used to absrob and clean up the spilled material.  In additon, the remaining 14 drums were also placed into salvage drums as a precaution.  Once resolved, the truck was allowed to continue to the intended waste management facility.","IN order to repvent a recurrence, the driver has been reonstructed that it is his responsibility to not only inspect the closures of the containers but the structural integrity of each package before he accounts for transportation.

Facility personnel secured the container dispatched a field service crew to re containerize the material before continued transportation.  While waiting for the crew to arrive, a courtesy telephonic report was made to the Texas Department of Environmental Quality (report No. 20090938) to advise them of the situation and explain the corrective actions being taken.

All clean-up debris, product and the empty cylinder body was placed into a suitable container and was sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility where it was received and properly disposed of.",The cylinder showed signs of abrasion near the pinhole leak in the side which indicated it had rubbed against another object during transportation.  The origin driver was instructed to use better care when loading objects for transportation and to take appropriate corrective actions should a container be observed to show signs of suspected damage.,No,CYLINDER,Non-reusable (non-refillable) cylinders NRC*,39,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

This caused the employee to loose control of the vehicle.  The vehicle left the roadway and rolled.  Less than 1 gallon of propane escaped due to damage to a vapor eliminator.  The employee’s only injury was a minor scratch on his face.,"The company has a rollover prevention policy titled, ""SLIP OFF STAY OFF"" with cab posters and training reminders.  The idea is to bring the vehicle under control without attempting to radically change the path which can cause liquid load shifting and add to the potential for overturn.  After each such accident a committee reviews the investigative facts to determine whether the driver followed company safety practices and whether disciplinary actions are appropriate.

The trailer was parked in the yard with the door closed.  An employee who walked past the trailer told one of the supervisors that the trailer had an odor.  The supervisor and freight manager approached the trailer that was still in the yard, and opened the door.  Upon opening the door the supervisor and freight manager immediately closed the door due to the strong odor.  The safety department was contacted, and the safety manager told the supervisors not to unload the trailer, and an emergency clean-up vendor would be called.  An MSDS for the material was obtained, and the emergency response vendor dispatched a crew to the terminal.  The emergency response vendor (BellonEnvironmental) on the phone instructed us to move the trailer (with the door closed) to another section of the yard that was not populated.  No one was evacuated from the building since the cylinders stayed in the trailer outside.  Upon the emergency clean-up crew's arrival, it was determined that the cylinders were not full.  However, one had a small amount of frozen residue on the valve that indicated that a residual amount had purged inside of the trailer due to it being warm that day.  The amount would have been a fraction of the full contents; however, it was trapped inside the trailer and caused a strong odor. All of the valves were open upon pick-up from the shipper, so the crew closed all of the valves and let the trailer set open over night and into the next day. The shipment was moved to destination the following day. Our company was not aware that the valves were open upon pick-up, and the cylinders were  supposed to be completely empty due to them being open and aired for for 3 days before the pick-up. It is hard to know how much was actually released; however, one of the the emergency response crew lead man at the scene said that he would estimate the release was less than 10 pounds.","The shipper should not be shipping cylinders with open valves, even if they are supposed to be empty.",No,CYLINDER,"Cylindrical metal container, not for compressed gases (i. e., not a pressure vessel)",CYL MTL,No,,,,,,,142,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2612,CON-WAY FREIGHT,US,

The BNSF train with NATX 33091 entrained was stopped on the main track near a remote area for inspection by a BNSF hazardous material responder. An audible vapor hiss could be heard when the BNSF responder approached NATX 33091. The responder found the valve protective housing cover not pinned or sealed. When the protective cover was lifted for valve inspection, product odor was detectable. The responder's inspection revealed that 2 of the 4 mounting flange bolts at the base of the vapor valve were less than tool tight (approximately 1/2 turn each). The responder tool tightened the flange bolts until no further vapor hiss and product odor was evident. No liquid product release was observed. Securement was completed by 1915 hrs. CST, 3/04/09. NATX 33091 was released to proceed in the train to the next major terminal (Springfield, MO) for follow-up inspection by shipper contract responders. The shipper contract responders inspected and re-tightened all flange bolts to 250 foot pounds of torque. All other valves and fittings were checked for securement and tested for leakage. After finding no exceptions, the valve housing cover was repinned and sealed. Shipper contractor response was concluded by approximately 1600 hrs. CST, 3/05/09.  Due to the BNSF main track service interruption during the initial response, nine BNSF trains were delayed averaging five hours with six of these trains requiring replacement train crews.",The shipper is reviewing internal processes to ensure future hazardous material shipments are not released into transportation prior to their final pre-trip preparations and inspections.,No,TANK CAR,Pressure,112JW,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2105,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Tank car GATX 40461, a load of molten sulfur, struck the north east corner of the bridge on Bayou Plaquemine. The impact caused a vertical gash at the body bolster of the tank car. The B end, right body bolster was sheared off. The gash was approximately 4 long and 6 wide and molten sulfur began leaking out as several pencil sized streams at first. Eventually a large volume of product streamed out until the sulfur began to cool and solidify forming a large stalactite on the side of the tank car. The molten sulfur that released coated the immediate area of the bridge and into the water of the bayou, and then it cooled, solidified and settled on the bottom at the edge of the bank.  GATX 40461 remained on the bridge until repairs could be completed to the approach. This car was re-railed and taken by rail to Addis.  No more sulfur leaked from the tank.    Train LLL66-06 derailed 5 cars. The train was travelling south when the seventh car from the power, tank car GATX 40461, a load of molten sulfur, struck the north east corner of the bridge on Bayou Plaquemine.  ASOX 296016 was next and fell off the north approach to the east down a 40 (app) dump, landing on the A end causing a large dent in the head.

Tank car GATX 40461, a load of molten sulfur, struck the north east corner of the bridge on Bayou Plaquemine. The impact caused a vertical gash at the body bolster of the tank car. The B end, right body bolster was sheared off. The gash was approximately 4 long and 6 wide and molten sulfur began leaking out as several pencil sized streams at first. Eventually a large volume of product streamed out until the sulfur began to cool and solidify forming a large stalactite on the side of the tank car. The molten sulfur that released coated the immediate area of the bridge and into the water of the bayou, and then it cooled, solidified and settled on the bottom at the edge of the bank.  GATX 40461 remained on the bridge until repairs could be completed to the approach. This car was re-railed and taken by rail to Addis.  No more sulfur leaked from the tank.    Train LLL66-06 derailed 5 cars. The train was travelling south when the seventh car from the power, tank car GATX 40461, a load of molten sulfur, struck the north east corner of the bridge on Bayou Plaquemine.

CELLUCCI,"VICE PRESDIENT, TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",42 Longwater Drive,NORWELL,MA,02061,Carrier,"A van trailer containing hazardous waste was en route from the shipper's location to the intended waste management facility.  During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a Clean Harbor's 10 day intransit facility located in West Sacramento, CA for the purpose of pikcing up additonal materials for continued transportation.  Upon arrival at the intransit facility it was discovered that approximatley 1 pint of material had escaped from either a loose or damaged closure device on the IBC.  The material was contained within the trailer and did not escape to the environment.  Upon discovery, facility personnel immedialtey placed a suitable absorbent material down to absorb the material that escaped from the package and called in an emergency response team.  Upon arrival, it was determined that the safest course of action was to transfer the material in the leaking container into an alternate package.  This component of the response was done without incident.  In addition, approximately 200 pounds of clean-up debris (absorbent material, decontamination media and disposable personal protective equipemtn) was generated during the course of the transfer, clean-up and decontamination operation and placed into a UN rated package for disposal.   At the conclusion of the response activity, the vehicle was dispatched to the intended waste management facility where the all material, including the original IBC, was processed and disposed of.","In order to prevent a recurrence, the loading facility and the driver have been reinstructed to ensure that all packages are thoroughly inspected prior to offerif for or acceting for transportation.

While doing his pretrip inspection, the driver noticed material leaking onto the trailer floor.  The facility's emergency response team was notified, they donned the appropriate PPE and entered the trailer.  Absorbent pads were placed on the trailer floor and the trailer was backed into the dock and the leaking drum was removed.  The drum was a salvage drum that had been used by the generator to overpack a leaking drum of acid that they had at their location.  The steel drum had corroded from the acid solution.  A plastic salvage drum was then used to overpack the material.

At an interim point Louisville KY an odor was detected and the overpack was observed by a supervisor along with another pail in the shipment on itsside. Thinking the pail was leaking he contacted safety and was instructed to isolate the trailer and contact a spill vendor. The spill vendor found the lid on the pail had failed to seal properly and the overpack lid was not secured tightly or the seal was defective allowing vapor to escape. There was no loss of liquid product only vapor. The spill vendor then overpacked the overpack containing the original 5 gallon pail and it was held in Louisville for disposition.This was prepared in response to missing info request on Tracking Number 2009040107.,Product should have been held in Newark for disposition and not shipped to the destination.

BNSF 880375 was carefully moved over the drip pan containment at the fuel track. Responders inspected BNSF 880375 and reported that the top operated bottom outlet valve (TOBOV) was closed and secured. The bottom outlet extension under the tank car was inspected and two of the four flange bolts appeared missing; product was leaking from this flanged connection. One bolt was absent and the other appeared to be broken off within the threaded connection. BNSF 880375 was unloaded in place. After BNSF 880375 was unloaded it remained over the containment area until no further product drips were evident.  A contractor's vacuum truck was used to capture the product spillage that remained atop the partially frozen ground. Impacted ground soil was excavated by a BNSF contractor and soil sampling initiated. All spillage recovered was placed into the used oil recovery system at this facility.

The driver attempted to avoid the deer by steering the vehicle to the right around the deer. The truck encountered the shoulder of the road and the rumble strips. Because of the sudden movement, the load began to surge causing the tractor to swerve from side to side. As the driver attempted to correct the movement and bring the vehicle back on the roadway, the rear wheels of the tractor broke traction, which added difficulty to controlling the vehicle. The tractor and trailer both overturned onto the passenger (right) side of the vehicle. The vehicle slid on its side for approximately 150 yards coming to rest against the Jersey barrier dividing the north and south lanes of the 4 lane road.    Continued on additional Sheet","Our fleet of tractors is presently being upgraded. The safety features include electronic stability control, brighterheadlamps, and moose bars which protect the tractor from damage in the event of hitting a large animal on the road.Also, each tractor will be equipped with updated GPS communications as required by TSA for PIH materials. The tractors will have a rollover alarm which sends an automatic signal to the QualComm base. The MC312 tank performed well under the stressful conditions. The tank was thicker than required for the pressure rating (0.5 "" vs0.325 "" steel). We believe this was a critical factor in the tank survival. The new DOT412 tanks are expected to perform better because of design improvements on valving and lines. The DOT412 design also mandates 0.5""stainless steel which will perform better because of its enhanced ductile strength.",Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,173500,HONEYWELL,US,

LABORATORY SUPERVISOR,9300 WEST JEFFERSON,DETROIT,MI,48209,Facility,"This is a report of the tank car GATX 44376 leak incident of March 9, 2009. The car in question was located in our tank car area, which is enclosed and was hooked up to our offloading equipment. The Senior Chemist on duty, Mr. James Irving went to prepare the car for service at approximately 8:30 AM. When he opened the gas header valve on the turret he noticed a leak coming from the turret valve area and he informed the maintenance staff on duty. When the area was checked, it was discovered that the leak was not coming from the turret valves but from the manway. After attempting to try to stop the leak, they contacted Mr. Gerald Scales, Assistant Sewage Plant Laboratory Supervisor, who was responsible for the area. It was recommended to him to call in the available Hazmat team, as the leak could not be controlled. It should be noted that the leak did not set off the alarms for the area, which are set at a minimum of 1 ppm. At the same time, the vendor of the product, PVS Technologies was called in to provide assistance with the tank car.  The HAZMAT team arrived on the scene at about 9 AM and checked the tank car. When they saw that the leak could not be stopped the declared a level two situation and called in for more support. The representatives of PVS technologies arrived at approximately 10 AM. The Hazmat team, the WWTP maintenance personnel and the PVS representatives went to check the car. The S02 detectors in the room were all reading zero at this time. When the car was checked, it was found leaking underneath the manway in the area of the gas valve that was connected to the facility. A portable gas detector registered about 3 ppm at the leak area. All parties retreated to the Main control room to discuss what to do next. It was determined that the leak was coming from the gasket that the manway sat on. After some discussion it was decided by WWTP management that the safest way to handle this was to transfer the product to a nearby empty tank car and evacuate the leaking tank car as soon as possible. The platform was configured to move the liquid from on car to another while at the same time have the car being filled feed gas into the offloading system allowing the WWTP to stay in regulatory compliance with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The transfer was started at about 2:30 PM and there were no incidents. The Hazmat team left shortly thereafter. The PVS representatives stated they would return the next day with personnel that could help patch the leak. The transfer of product was to take between twenty four (24) and forty eight (48) hours to complete.    PVS personnel arrived the next day with a maintenance expert, which examined the car and applied a patch to the manway area. When the car was checked for leaks with ammonia, no visible leaks were found. The tank car pressure was measured at 0 psi n the afternoon shift and the car was closed off. The vendor was notified on March 11 that the car was emptied and cl",NO COMMENT PROVIDED,No,TANK CAR,Pressure,105JW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,DWWTP,US,

They notified a security guard at the plant who then contacted their inhouse response team. It was discovered that product was leaking from the thermometer well of this railcar.

Train crews in the area reported to the railroad dispatcher this car to have liquid running out of dome on car.  Emergency services were notified, along with car shipper/owner. It was discovered that the valve stem on a liquid valve on the top of the dome was leaking on account of bad packing on the stem of the valve. Shipper/owners responded with a crew, who repaired the leaking liquid valve on the top of the tank car.  It is estimated that about 40 Gallons of product leaked from the defective valve and leached into the ground.  The leak was contained to an area of about five square feet under the center of the tank car. The shipper hired an outside contractor to handle remediation and clean up of dirt/ground in the area.  The shipper/owner, Etc'ra,Inc., is a division of Proctor and Gamble, who handled repairs for the rail tank car and the clean up, along with disposal of soils from the area under the tank car.  This soil consisted of about 30 Cubic Yards of material. The material was disposed of at a certified dump site and replaced with new materials.  Test were completed of all soilsin the area and found not to contain any material from the spill.  Tank car repairs consisted of removal of the valve and replacement with a new valve of like design.","No suggestions to prevent recurrence, except for better inspections of cars by shipper prior to placing intotransportation.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8267,SIERRA NORTHERN RAILWAY,US,
