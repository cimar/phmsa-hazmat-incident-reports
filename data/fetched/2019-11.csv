Upon offloading the  trailer, the leaking drum was identified and overpacked. The leaked material inside the trailer and  on the ground was remediated using spill dry.  All debris and PPE were placed in a container for  proper disposal. The trailer was reloaded and the overpacked container was placed on the rear of  the trailer.  The package failure was the result of a hole in the bottom of the container. Veolia  witnessed liquid dripping out of the hole and flowing onto the floor of the trailer. Veolia believes that the hole may have come from gravel. The drums were shipped from a pipeline company and may have been stored on gravel prior to being loaded on the truck.  The gravel could have worn a hole  in the bottom of the drum. There is also a chance that the container was damaged before it was  used for its current purpose.",Veolia overpacked the container to ensure that it would not leak as it continues in transportation to the  final disposal site. Veolia has also contact the broker that provided the container to express concern with the condition of the container.  Veolia also spoke with the field office that loaded the trailer.  The  container should have been properly inspected by both parties prior to leaving the original shipper's  location.  Veolia's team will be retrained on what to look for when loading and unloading containers.

As a result of the leak, one(1) 55-gallon drum leaked approximately 1.5 gallons of adhesive containing fiammable liquid to the trailer interior At approximately 2:30 p.m. CST, a representative with RLC retained Cura Emergency Services, L.C. (CES) to manage the environmental cleanup of the site. Based on the available information, the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from Environmental Management Alternatives (EMA) to assess and remediate the site. EMA crews entered the trailer, shifted materials in trailer to gain access, and noted that a 55-gallon drum of adhesive had released 1- 1.5 gallons from the bung due to an unsecured bung cap. EMA cleaned glue impacted trailer freight with parts cleaner, then cleaned trailer floor with parts cleaner. All areas were cleaned with absorbent rags. All cleanup waste was collected and containerized in one(1) 55-gallon drum for disposal. EMA re-secured the bung cap and trailer freight.

The car was isolated and notifications were made.  BNSF Hazmat responders arrived to the car and performed an assessment.  All leaked ethanol evaporated from the car body.  One manway swingbolt was found to be less than tool tight near the manway hinge.  Responders removed the shipper's load seal from the manway swingbolt and opened the manway to inspect the gasket and sealing surface.  The hard lid gasket appeared to be in fair condition but was replaced with a nozzle gasket as a precaution and the lid was resecured.  All other fittings and appliances on the car were inspected.  No remediation was necessary as all ethanol had evaporated.  The car was then released for continued movement in transportation.",Recommendation to POET to review loading inspection procedures to ensure that personnel understand that all fittings on the car are to be tightened to a tool tight condition.(NAR:212),No,TANK CAR,,117J100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF - BNSF Railway Company,US,

Call immediately reached out to BNSF to inform the RR of the car condition.  BNSF kept the car isolated until an inspection could be performed by Hazmat responders.  NRC Env was contracted to respond and inspect the car.  Upon arrival, responders found that a small amount of product had been released from between the flange underneath the liquid line valve.  All 4 nuts on this flange were less than hand tight and easily moved.  Responders secured the valve by tool tightening the valve and cleaning residual coal tar pitch from the valve housing and car body.  A small amount of impacted ballast was removed and placed into a waste container for appropriate disposal.  On 11/13/19, Cal Stocking approved movement of the car to destination without an OTMA.  The short move to Intalco was made on 11/22/19.  The car lessee (Ruetgers) will apply OTMA to move the car to a location to have a bubble leak test performed.","Prior to releasing the car for transportation, the shipper should ensure all fittings and closures are properly secured.

After they did some investigating the plant personnel advised they weren't aware that the plant had installed a new inline shut off valve so product wasn't pumping anywhere. The amount of pressure deadheading in the hose was causing some seepage from a hose connection in to the bucket. He noticed the bucket had tipped over and isn't sure if a plant employee accidentally knocked it over as he saw them picking it up or if it just had fallen over. 1 pint spilled on the ground. He was able to complete the delivery once they opened the inline valve and his hose connection didn't leak any further. The cleaned it up with spill pads.,In this case I think the hose tipped the spill bucket over.  I believe this was an isolated incident not due to clumsiness.

MARTIN,OPERATIONS PROJECT MANAGER,25800 SCIENCE PARK DR # 300,CLEVELAND,OH,44122-7386,Carrier,"Austin Powder Company (USDOT # 103999) driver was driving a tractor/tanker combination in Marion, IL in early morning November 14, 2019. The road conditions were dry.  The cargo was 43,000 of bulk ammonium nitrate emulsion (UN3375). The vehicle was Westbound on I-24 and attempting to take the I-57 Southbound exit ramp.  The ramp is a relatively sharp curve to the right.  The vehicle took the curve too fast and lost control, overturning onto its driver side, skidding on the road and grass, and finally coming to rest on the right hand side of the road.  A small hole in the head of the tanker caused roughly 35 gallons of product to leak from the package, which was a DOT 407 Specification cargo tank.  First responders arrived at the scene and closed the road.  The driver received a citation in conjunction with the accident (see attachment), and was transported to a local hospital for non-life threatening injuries.  A cleanup crew and wreckers were dispatched to the scene, as well as another company vehicle pulling an empty cargo tank in order to transfer the product.  The damaged vehicle was put upright by the wreckers and the hole in the tank head was plugged.  The product was pumped completely off the damaged vehicle into the other company vehicle.  The damaged vehicle was towed away and has since been deemed  a total loss.  The cleanup crew containerized the product and impacted soil, and removed it from the scene for disposal.  The road was then re-opened.",We feel that the root cause of this accident  based upon our data from the vehicle and the police report is driving too fast for conditions-- specifically negotiating the curve of the road too fast.

Internal and external valves were closed, and driver enacted stop work authority. Driver  notified the receiver he had a small leak, and then notified dispatch of the issue. Dispatch called a road service company (Magnolia Diesel) out to inspect and repair the external discharge valve. Once road service arrived, they found the external valve was missing a gasket, and this mechanic stated he was not trained on a 407 chemical trailer, so a second mechanic was dispatch out that was trained on 407 trailers. The trailer was cleaned and prepped at St. Gabriel Tank Wash. The tank wash employee failed to prep the trailer correctly. Two errors identified, as there was no external valve gasket installed, and the tank wash failed to perform the required vacuum and pressure testing the discharge valve assembly as required. This final step of the prep would have identified the issue of no gasket installed and should have been corrected immediately, then retested to ensure the discharge valve assembly passed the vacuum, and pressure test.  The second mechanic had to get a gasket, install it, then when he put the external valve/clamp back together he failed to properly install external valve clamp. The barrel nut on the clamp was in the wrong position, which allowed the valve to fail when pressure was applied to off load the product.","Failure 1/corrective action - Trailer was not properly cleaned and prepped at tank wash. St Gabriel tank wash has reviewed this major service failure and taken appropriate disciplinary action with the employees involved with this service failure. They have also reviewed this failure of not putting external gasket and not following proper prepping testing and procedures. St Gabriel tank wash put in place additional steps to insure this does not happen again.  Failure 2/ corrective action - The  first road service mechanic admitted  he wasn't trained to repair a 407 chemical trailer, so the process was stopped, and another mechanic (trained on 407 repairs was sent) Failure 3/corrective action - The second mechanic that arrived the next day had previous experience in installing the gasket and the external valve clamp. He failed in installing the wing nut properly as shown in the pictures attached. Magnolia Diesel Services has been made aware of this failure and are taking corrective actions.  Pictures attached Highway Transport corrective action - Safety stand down was conducted and completed with all Highway Managers, dispatchers, mechanics, tank cleaners, and drivers on 11-25-19 This spill/injury is being discussed daily with drivers as a reminder to take full safety precautions and to wear all safety equipment necessary for the unloading of the specified chemical and safety requirements  We are also conducting extra training classes with divers, shop and wash rack technician’s concerning the proper way to connect the external valve wing nut clamp.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,24020,"HIGHWAY TRANSPORT PETROLEUM, LLC",US,

As a result of the accident, the drum released approximately eight (8) gallons of ink to the interior of a box trailer at door 454 of the R+L terminal located at the above-referenced address. At approximately 10:20 p.m. CST, a representative with R+L retained ^ i Cura Emergency Services, L.C.(CES) to manage the environmental cleanup of the site. Based ' on the available information, the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from First Call Environmental(FCE) to assess and remediate the site. At Approximately 12:40 p.m. CST, FCE personnel arrived and assessed the site. Crews observed a 16 foot long by 8 foot wide area of impact on the floor of the trailer. FC personnel deployed granular absorbents to the trailer and swept them in with hand tools. Crews scrubbed the floor of the trailer to remove staining.

ONE OF OUR MAIN PRODUCTS IS THE M739A1 ARTILLERY FUZE THAT ACTION MAKES FOR THE U.S ARMY. THE M739A1 ARTILLERY FUZE THAT ACTION MAKES FOR THE U.S. ARMY. THE M739A1 FUZE IS INITIALLY ASSEMBLED AT ACTION'S PLANT IN BRISTOL, PA. THE ASSEMBLED M739A1 FUZE AT BRISTOL IS A CLASS 1.4D EXPLOSIVE. AFTER  ASSEMBLY, THE M739A1 FUZE IS SHIPPED TO ACTION'S ATGLEN, PA PLANT WHERE AN EXPLOSIVE BOOSTER IS ADDED. THE BOOSTERED M739A1 IS A CLASS 1.2D EXPLOSIVE. A COMPANY OWNED TRUCK IS USED TO TRANSPORT MATERIAL BETWEEN ACTION'S BRISTOL AND ATGLEN PLANTS.  ACTION IS PARTICIPATING IN A U.S. ARMY ENGINEERING STUDY TO ENHANCE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE M739A1 FUZE. AS PART OF THE STUDY, THE U.S. ARMY SENT 288 M739A1 FUZES TO ACTION'S ATGEN PLANT FOR DE-BOOSTERING. ON NOVEMBER 12, 2019, BELIEVING THAT ALL THE FUZES HAD BEEN DE-BOOSTERED, ACTION SHIPPED THE 288 M739A1 FUZES, PACKED IN 36 4A STEEL BOXES (SEE PART III QUESTION 27), FROM THE ATGLEN PLANT TO THE BRISTOL PLANT WHERE THE DE-BOOSTERED FUZES WERE TO BE DISASSEMBLED AS PART OF THE STUDY. WHEN ONE OF THE AMMUNITION BOXES CONTAINING THE FUZES WAS OPENED AT THE BRISTOL PLANT, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE 8 FUZES IN THE BOX WERE STILL BOOSTERED. BECAUSE ACTION BELIEVED THAT ALL THE FUZES WERE UNBOOSTERED, THE 288 M739A1 FUZES HAD BEEN SHIPPED FROM ATGLEN TO BRISTOL VIA THE COMPANY TRUCK AND PLACARDED AS 1.4D UNBOOSTERED FUZES, WHEN THE PRESENCE OF THE 8 BOOSTERED FUZES REQUIRED THAT THE SHIPMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLACARDED AS A 1.2D SHIPMENT. PROMPTLY AFTER DISCOVERY, THE 8 BOOSTERED FUZES WERE SHIPPED BACK TO THE ATGLEN PLANT BY COMMON CARRIER AS 1.2D EXPLOSIVES.  PLEASE SEE ATTACHED SHEET FOR CONTINUATION.","M739 A1 FUZE DE-BOOSTERING IS A RARELY PERFORMED OPERATION. CHANGES IN PROCEDURE TO PREVENT RECURRENCE ARE: AMMUNITION BOXES WITH M739A1 FUZES TO BE DE-BOOSTERED WILL BE SET ASIDE ON A SEPARATE SKID. ONLY ONE AMMUNITION BOX AT A TIME WILL BE TAKEN TO THE DE-BOOSTERING WORK STATION. ANY TIME AN OPERATOR LEAVES THE WORK STATION, ALL FUZES FROM EACH AMMUNITION BOX MUST BE DE-BOOSTERED AND THE STATION CLEARED. AFTER DE-BOOSTERING, THE FUZES WILL BE REPACKED IN THE AMMUNITION BOX AND MOVED TO A SEPARATE SKID DESIGNATED AS ""COMPLETED UNBOOSTERED FUZES."" AT THE END OF THE DE-BOOSTERING JOB, THE SUPERVISOR OVERSEEING THE OPERATION WILL 100% INSPECT THE FUZES. THE INSPECTION WILL INCLUDE A 100% COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF DE-BOOSTERED FUZES WITH A COUNT OF BOOSTER PELLETS TO BE SURE THE NUMBERS MATCH. THE INSPECTION WILL BE COMPLETED PRIOR TO THE SKID BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE PLANT WAREHOUSE.

THE INTER-MODAL CONTAINER (EDSU 0084) WAS LOADED IN NEW JERSEY AND SHIPPED TO INRD FOR OFFLOADING AND TRANSPORT TO THE INTENDED DESTINATION. THE RAIL YARD OPERATOR OBSERVED THAT CONTAMINATED SOIL MATERIAL WAS RELEASED OUT ONTO THE TARP AND IN BETWEEN THE INTER-MODAL BOXES (HESU 48568, MJVU 1015) BELOW ESDU 0084. THE RAIL YARD OPERATOR IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED MANAGEMENT.  TWO HT EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHED TO THE INRD TO INVESTIGATE AND INITIATE A CLEANUP AND RECOVERY PLAN. THEY TOOK PICTURES OF MATERIAL RELEASED FROM THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER AND TRAPPED ON TOP, IN BETWEEN, AND ON THE RAILCAR. THERE WAS NO CONTAMINATED SOIL OBSERVED ON THE RAIL BALLAST OR GROUND. TARPS WERE PLACED UNDER THE CONTAINER TO COLLECT ANY MATERIAL THAT MAY FALL OFF THE CONTAINER OR RAILCAR DURING CLEAN UP. THE TAILGATE ON ESDU 0084 WAS SECURED WITH NEW CHAINS AND BINDERS, THEN ESDU 0084 WAS REMOVED FROM THE RAILCAR.  LOOSE MATERIAL WAS COLLECTED BETWEEN LOWER BOTTOM CONTAINERS, FROM THE TOP OF CONTAINERS TARPS, AND OFF THE RAILCAR AND RETURNED TO THE ORIGINAL INTERMODAL CONTAINER. THE TARPS THAT HAD BEEN PLACED UNDER THE RAILCAR AS CONTAINMENT WERE ROLLED WITH ANY LOOSE MATERIAL AND PLACED INTO THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER ESDU 0084. APPROXIMATELY 4 HOURS ELAPSED BETWEEN THE TIME THE RELEASE WAS NOTICED AND THE CLEAN UP WAS COMPLETE.  DURING THE CLEANUP, IT WAS NOTED THE LEAD CAR ON THE SERVICE TRACK ASSIGNED TO HT HAD A BROKEN HINGE PIN ON THE KNUCKLE. HT IDENTIFIED A PORTION OF THE OLD KNUCKLE PIN REMAINED IN THE KNUCKLE, AND HT REPRESENTATIVES OBSERVED THAT A NEW PIN WAS INSTALLED ON TOP OF THE OLD PIN. AS A RESULT, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE NEW PIN WAS STICKING UP ABOVE THE KNUCKLE AND NOT SECURED. IT IS UNKNOWN WHERE OR WHEN THE CHAINS BROKE ON THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER, BUT IT APPEARS THAT DURING THE COURSE OF THE SHIPMENT THE CARS MAY HAVE HUMPED TOO HARD OR BEEN HIT BY ANOTHER CAR USING AN ENGINE WHICH CAUSED THE CHAINS TO BREAK ON INTERMODAL CONTAINER.  HT VISUAL INSPECTION RECORDS INDICATE THE CONTAINER DID NOT HAVE ANY DEFECTS WHEN SHIPPED EMPTY OR LOADED BY RAIL OR TRUCK UNTIL IT WAS OBSERVED THE CHAINS WERE BROKEN AFTER THE CAR HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE INRD YARD IN INDIANAPOLIS. THE EMPTY INTERMODAL CONTAINER WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED WHEN IT LEFT THE RAILYARD IN BRIDGEPORT, NJ TO GO TO THE CUSTOMER'S SITE FOR LOADING. EACH INTER-MODAL CONTAINER WAS ALSO INSPECTED BEFORE AND AFTER LOADING AT THE CUSTOMER SITE, AS WELL AS WHEN IT WAS PLACED ON THE RAILCAR IN BRIDGEPORT, NJ FOR SHIPMENT.

At approximately 9:45 am CDT, a crew from E3 arrived on-site. Following a site assessment, E3 personnel noted approximately 10 gallons of Xylene, Ethylbenzene released to the trailer floor, further migrating to the concrete surface below. The cause of the leak was found to be a faulty cap on the valve. Crews utilized a fork lift to remove the tote from the trailer. Once removed, E3 personnel transferred the contents from the faulty tote into a new tote. Crew then deployed hydrocarbon appetite microbial agent to the trailer concrete surface below. E3 personnel utilized absorbent pad to wipe the trailer floor and remaining totes that were impacted. All Xylene, ethylbenzene impacted material was collected and contalnerized In one(1) 55-gallon drum, as well as the faulty tote, for transport and disposal. E3 Personnel noted no further actions were required on-site and crews demobilized.","Following the corrective actions, no visual or olfactory evidence of the Xylene, Ethylbenzene could be observed at the site. Based on these results, it api that the corrective actions were successful, and no further action should be required.
