THE BENZENE WOULD BE VACUUM LOADED FROM 55 GALLON DRUMS. WHILE VACUUMING THE SECOND DRUM INTO THE TANK TRUCK, A VAPOR EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT THE DRUM, BURNING THE DRIVER AND AN AETC EMPLOYEE.  THE PLANT FIRE BRIGADE AND TARRYTOWN FIRE DEPT. RESPONDED, AND EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE BURNING AT THE DRUM.  INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT MAJOR FACTORS WERE INSUFFICIENT BONDING BETWEEN THE DRUM AND GROUNDED TANK TRUCK, AND THE USE OF A PVC DIP TUBE.  ADDITIONAL GROUNDING AND BONDING CAPABILITIES WERE INSTALLED ON THE VACUUM TRUCK, AND THE PVC DIP TUBE WAS REPLACED WITH COPPER.  ON 6/10/88, THE LOADING WAS COMPLETED.  THE DELIVERY WAS MADE 6/13/88 WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.  CORRECTIVE ACTION:  ALL VACUUM TRUCKS HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH ADDITIONAL GROUNDING AND BONDING CAPABILITIES, AND ALL DIP TUBES HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH COPPER.
