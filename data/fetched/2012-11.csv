The crack which developed was approximately 1.5-2 feet in length.  The driver called in the incident to corporate management and Highway Patrol arrived on the scene.  An emergency response company was called to clean up the spilled material.  The material (sodium hydroxide solution) was on the dirt shoulder of the road and did not enter any other medium.  Traffic was controlled on several lanes of the Highway to allow for safe cleanup of the material.  Cal Trans was called onto the scene by the Highway Patrol.

After initial inspection by PTRA Director of Safety it was determined that the car could be moved over to the holding track in American Yard for repairs by M&M PRotection. The car was observed with product leaking from a defective vacuum relief valve on the manway cover. Product would only escape when the tank was moved during normal switching operations. Leakage was only noted on the left side of the tank car with no noticeable product on the ground.  The car was spotted in the holding track later that night and M&M Protection responded to the scene for repair and remediation the following morning 11/9/12. M&M removed the vaccuum relief valve and replaced the gasket and reinstalled the valce. The tank car was pressure washed with a biodegradeable micro bug solution and released from bad order status at 1230 hrs on November 9, 2012.","ExxonMobil has been notified of the incident and is investigating to see if the vacuum relief valve was funtioning properly prior to loading and shipment from the refinery in Montana.

Approximately 20 minutes after takeoff the load supervisor entered the cargo compartment to perform an after takeoff check to verify the security of the load.  He could hear and see that there was gas escaping from one of the packages in the forward part of the cargo compartment (position 3R). The packages were still secure and in conformity with the orientation arrows. He left the compartment and shut the “smoke barrier” door.   A check of the NOTOC showed that there were 4 Dewars of UN1963 Helium, refrigerated liquid in that position.     Package failure details:  Unable to get any further details, Florida West procedures prohibit re-entry into the cargo compartment after a HazMat release has been detected. Upon Landing at Buenos Aires, crew was immediately transported to customs then to a hotel. The cargo was unloaded by LAN Cargo Airlines who had chartered our aircraft for this flight.    Duration of Leak:  Approximately 15 Minutes    Mitigating the effects:  Upon noticing the leak, the cargo compartment was isolated from the crew by securing the smoke barrier door. The ICAO ERG was consulted and complies with. The Captain called flight control for additional advice.    The Director of Safety called the 24 Hour Emergency Number on the Shipper’s Declaration, which was Chemtrec, Chemtrec transferred the call to the shipper, Praxair who located someone with knowledge of the product.

No exposure or contact was reported. Appropriate notifications were made and emergency responders activated.    Once the responder arrived on-site and was briefed on situation, they conducted a tank car inspection. Upon further inspection of the tank car, it was discovered that the leak was generating from a loose fill tube lid. Also, it was noted that the fill tube gasket was misaligned. The responder replaced the misaligned gasket with a proper fitting gasket and the fill tube lid was tightened appropriately to tool tightness.    The leaked residue on the side and top of the tank car was nuetralized by means of Soda Ash. At approximately 4:52 AM, the tank car was secured and released back into transportation.    File Note Item 12-according to the waybill (Waybill #305492) the origin address differed from the shipping address. After diligent searching, the origin could not be verified by preparer of this report.    File Note Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:  The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases   (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.    The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

When the fire department arrived they set a hose line and fogged the truck with water. The Hazmat team wrapped a wet cloth around the leak and slowed it conciderably.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Texmark Chemicals was notified via CHEMTREC report #2012-1107-00211. Summit Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found two bolts on the liquid valve nozzle plate were less than tool tight and a plug into the nozzle plate had no sealant, releasing product. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, Linda, 713-818-1920. Contractor personnel secured the bolts and rapped teflon tape around the plug and secured it. The car was decontaminated, the leak secured and released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move.

Vehicle 2, being a farm tractor pulling a grain wagon, was NB in front of Vehicle 1.  Vehicle 1 attempted to pass Vehicle 2.  Vehicle 1 and tanker was halfway past Vehicle 2 when Vehicle 2 turned left into the side of Vehicle 1.  Vehicle 2 was attempting to turn into a field.  Vehicle 2 lost front left dual tires. Tires went under the fitting box of the tank being pulled by Vehicle 1.  The tires acted as a ramp as Vehicle 1 continued NB and overturned.  Vehicle 1 tank trailer was gouged and began to leak onto roadway and in ditch line.  Emergency Responders at the scene were 3 fire departments (one being Mercer County) to contain product and spread sand around overturned unit.  Interdyne Corporation was called to handle emergency clean-up and remediation services.  Others that responded to scene were Mercer Co. Sheriffs Dept., Big Daddy's Towing, OH EPA, local highway department as well as other agencies not known.  We have not received descriptive reports that finalize remediation efforts at this point.","Traveling the rural routes in agricultural areas require as much attention as the main interstate system.  We train our drivers to constantly be aware of their surroundings and, when approaching slower traffic, to take extra precautions such as following distances and clear passing lanes.

LOSH,"EHS MANAGER, CHMM, CSP",333 Rouser Rd,Moon Township,PA,15108,Other-Terminal Operator for TR,"On November 17 2012 at the TRANSFLO-General Products transloading terminal in Charlotte, NC, a release of approximately 15 gallons of elevated temperature asphalt occurred. While in the process of unloading liquid asphalt from rail car UTLX 68985, it was discovered that a small stream of liquid asphalt was running out of the bleeder valve that is located on the unloading product hose. It was estimated that approximately 15 gallons of PG 64-22 asphalt was released from the bleeder valve on the product hose and hardened in the sand between the rails. The railcar is unloaded using a product hose that is connected to the bottom outlet of the railcar. This prodcut hose is connected after the asphalt is heated to a liquid state using steam. When the railcar is heated to the required temperature and the product hose is connected to the bottom railcar outlet, the valve on the railcar is opened which allows the asphalt to flow through the product hose.  Following the written procedure, the bleeder valve on the product hose is kept closed these steps. The employee responsible for the unloading stated that the bleeder valve on the product hose was in the closed position and that no leak was visible when the railcar valve was intially opened.  After a few minutes of unloading a stream of asphalt was released from the bleeder valve on the unloading product house. It is suspected that hardened asphalt in the bleeder valve of the product hose prevented the ball valve from seating fully when the hazmat employee closed the bleeder valve on that hose. As the asphalt flowed through the product hose, the hardened asphalt liquefied due to the heat and began to seep out of the bleeder valve. By the time that steam was removed from the railcar and the asphalt returned to a hardened state, approximately 15 gallons had released through the product hose bleeder valve. Fortunately all asphalt was contained within the sand between the two rails. Once the asphalt on the ballast hardened, it was shoveled out and disposed of.",Corrective Actions to prevent reoccurance:   1) Replace the bleeder valve on the product hose- COMPLETED 11/9/2012  2) Instruct transloading hazmat employees to cycle the valve a few times to ensure all residual liquid asphalt is cleared from the bleeder valve. In addition the transloading hazmat employees should thoroughly inspect the product hose bleeder valve for signs that asphalt may have hardened in the valve.   3) Ensure the railcar valve is not opened if there is any difficultly closing the bleeder valve on the product hose- COMPLETED 11/9/2012   3) Re-train employees of the requirement to visually observe the product hose during the unloading process to ensure leaks do not occur when potentially hardened asphalt in the bleeder valve is liquefied. – COMPLETED -11/9/2012,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Kinder Morgan,US,

A containment area of absorbents was built and the wrecker service lifted the trailer to drain the free standing product from the trailer onto the containment of absorbents. The contractor offloaded two damaged totes from the trailer but could not remove the remaining totes due to them being lodged inside because of the trailer being warped from the accident.

The driver exited the highway at exit 195 and parked on the shoulder of the road. A minimal amount of acrylic acid was leaking from the trailer floor to the asphalt surface of the highway.     The Virginia Department of Transportation, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) and the state hazmat team responded to the release to establish traffic control and perform the initial assessment of the release. State and county representatives also contacted Dow Chemical to gain insight as to the product released.      The responding agencies set up a command center and decon. facilities. The state hazmat team donned level A personal protective equipment (PPE) and entered the release area. Material leaking from outside the trailer froze due to the current weather conditions. Once the material thawed, soda ash was dispersed to neutralize the liquid. The crew entered the trailer and discovered two 55-gallon drums containing acrylic acid had fallen over during transport, and one had leaked releasing approximately 40 gallons to the trailer floor. The hazmat team used soda ash to collect and neutralize the freestanding fluid. The drum was flipped over and overpacked to prevent further release. Spent soda ash was left on the the trailer for transport to the destination facility.      Once the material had been cleaned, the Department of Transportation inspected the load and approved it for transport to its original destination.

They started their investigation and discovered that their was product spilled at 2 locations (at the intersection of US 69 and MLK and also at the spot our driver had pulled over). The estimated gals. spilled was about 10 gals. total. Once the spill was contained, they started their investigation to determine the cause of the spill. They discovered that there were 2 locations on the trailer that were leaking. The first leak was on the vapor line where it screws on to the trailer. The line was removed and repaired by installing a 3"" cap in it's place. The 2nd leak was on the pressure relief valve.

In manuvering a turn on the marine terminal, the driver of the stacker struck a loaded tank DCIU0750404 loaded with UN1648 Acetonnitrile class 3 toppling it from a third tier stack on to loaded tank DPCU001241-0 containing UN2478, Isocyanate Solution, Flammable, Toxic, NOS (Xylene Butylisocyanate)class 3(6.1).  The DCPU0001241-0 was damaged but there was no cargo leak.  A separate incident report will be filed to note this structural damage.    The fire department was notified immediately along with the Clean up Contractor, Clan Harbors and a report was made to Chemtrec along with the shipper.  A verbal report was filed with the NRC and the EQB in Puerto Rico.  The NRC Report noted communications with the EPA.  The spill was contained to the asphalt with oil dry berms.  No product entered any drains on the yard.  The USCG and the EQP were present during the clean up. The product from the leaking tank was transferred into another tank at the shipper's instructions.",The stacker driver has had training on on top loaders and accident prevention.

We classified the material as Waste Hypochlorite Solutions, DOT Class 8, PG II, with a D002 waste code. On November 2nd, a Univar forklift operator was loading the IBCs into a trailer for shipment to the TSDF.  When loading the 12th of 13 IBCs, a fork, which extended beyond the back of the IBC, punctured a hole in the bottle of a previously loaded IBC, resulting in the release of sodium hypochlorite into the trailer.  The employee then picked up the damaged IBC and backed it out onto the concrete loading dock.  Additional plant employees used absorbent materials from the emergency spill kits in an attempt to contain the released material.  Some liquid ran beneath a dock door and outside to another concrete pad used for trailer loading.  Additionally, approximately 10 gallons of sodium hypochlorite was released from the trailer near the nose onto concrete and asphalt and pooled in soil surrounding railroad tracks.  Members of our technical support team used vacuums to recover free standing liquids.  The damaged IBC had contained approximately 300 gallons of liquids prior to the incident.  Approximately 50 gallons of liquid was recovered with the vacuums,  approximately 25 gallons remained in the tote and was not released.  We estimate that the absorbents recovered approximately 50 gallons.","The forklift operator was retrained and recertified for forklift operation.    We will revise the local plant procedures for trailer loading/unloading.    Conduct refresher training for all plant employees on the use of spill tools, supplies and techniques.

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders inspected SHPX 208181 and observed product surrounding the exposed threads above the BOC. Further inspection revealed that the bottom operated bottom outlet valve (BOV) was slightly open.

Upon the arrival of Roseville Fire they located the MBLX34290 and monitored with a 4 gas monitoring device. Roseville Fire climbed on the tank car and inspected all the valves and fittings under the protective housing. During their inspection they located the liquid valve on the B end of the tank car to be open and the plug of the same valve to be loose (less than tool tight). Roseville Fire closed the Valve a half turn and then removed the plug completely, placing 4 wraps of teflon tape around the threads of the plug and then replacing it on the liquid valve and securing it properly. They then continued to monitor and concluded that there was no longer a leak.   I arrived at approximately 1300 hours on 11/09/2012 and conducted another inspection of the MBLX34290 and concluded it was secure and no leak occurring.","I recommend that Exxon Mobil in Torrance Ca be visited and loading procedures be evaluated, this is the second incident with them with in 17 days.

The emergency response tel number / service was not working properly and not able to be contacted to obtain MDSD or other emergency hazmat response information , such as inhaladtion dangers (  if any ) .   Due to lack of hazmat emergecny response information and the strong unpleasent odor the warehouse was evacuated for about 30 minutes. A hazamat company was contacted for cleanup, however the Chicago Fire Department stored the damaged hazmat drum in a salvage drum before the hazmat team arrived.   The hazmat company cleaned up the small amount of spillage ( less than 2 onces )12Nov, which was stored in a remote location away from staff. Hazmat company disposed of this waste.   Emergency response information line was contacted 3 times at the time of the incident without being reached- caller was put on hold for several minutes to get an English speaker but the caller did not understand he was being put on hold as the emergency response staff only spoke French, so the caller hung up each time after being put on hold for several minutes.   The next morning the emergency response number was reached after waiting several minutes, emergency information was not readily available, was provided in about 90 minutes due phone connections of their system and being sent to the incorrect email address due to typo of the emergency response provider.","The forklift damage has been addressed to the staffing provider on a continuing basis but this was a service failure of the contractor as forklift usage is not allowed with HAZMAT/ DGR in general and in particular in this case.

Car was initially in the ""Rip track"" building for a five (5) year airbrake test, when it was noted to be leaking.  Car was subsequently isolated outside on track BNR3 do to the nature of the product and a bucket placed under the bottom outlet valve to capture any product.  Upon arrival, I noted the bottom outlet cap was loose and wrenched tighten same and suspected that gasket may be defective. I left the bucket in place in the event of further leakage.  I subsequently  climbed car to open manway to see how much product was remaining in car, as car was being shipped residual  last contained ,Hydrocarbons Liquid N.O.S. I observed the manway bolts loose or off. I opened manway and noted that ball valve was closed and approximately 20-30- US gallons of product remaining I closed manway and tightened all bolts.  Contact was made to SWS Environmental Company for response of gasket replacement on bottom outlet cap. On 11/16/2012, Dave Estep, of SWS arrived on scene and removed bottom outlet cap and noted gasket exceptionally y worn (Figure 1).  Gasket was subsequently replaced with new ""Viton"" gasket.  Additionally I noted the absence of seals on the following:   Manway, applied IHBRR 164900  Bottom outlet valve, applied IHBRR 164851  Bottom outlet cap, applied IHBRR 164899  Valve Box on top of car was sealed with CPC 270640.  ""Chemtrec"" was contacted on 11/15/2012 for assistance with notifying shipper/consignee to obtain MSDS information which was supplied.  Chevron Phillips was advised to inspect car for suspected product contamination of residual as manway was not secure. Chevron Phillips advised that car would be flagged. Car was released for movement to destination.","Inspection of bottom outlet gasket for signs of wear, do to frequency of opening and closing of bottom outlet plug which may cause wear on cap.

Appropriate notifications were made and emergency responders activated.    At approxiamtely 9:15 P.M. repsonders arrived and began investigating source of possible ammonia leak. Upon further investigation, two suspected cars were cleared leaving only tank car TELX 556 left (a tank car containing Methyl Mercaptan not ammonia). After a leak detection test was performed using a snoop solution, it was discovered that a small leaked had occurred at the mounting bolts of the pressure relief device (PRD) of the tank car TELX 556. After the responders tried to tighten mounting bolts of PRD to no avail, a Midland capping kit was utilized to contain/stop the leak from the mounting bolts.    After successful installation of Midland kit, per shipper direction, the tank car was immediately switch move back to origin (per 174.50), which is located closely adjacent to the subject yard.     *No injuries were reported.    File Note Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:  The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable.     For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.    The shipper can reference http://nar.aar.com for help understanding and preventing NARs. To improve communications the shipper can provide contact information in this web site (Contact Network) to better facilitate incident response and post incident communications as applicable.",No,TANK CAR,,105J300W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

The customers’ air supply is regulated to 20 PSIG. The driver had a 3 inch to 2 inch reducer connected to the cargo tanks 3 inch outlet. One 2 inch chemical hose approximately 18 feet in length was connected from the 3-2 reducer fitting to the consignee’s 2 inch receiving line. All connections were camlock type.  It appears the driver disconnect the 2 inch delivery hose at the 3-2 reducer before all product was transferred from the cargo tank to the receiving tank. A plant worker observed product blowing from the rear of the trailer and the driver washing down with a water hose. He immediately radioed for help from others in the plant and assisted the driver to wash down with water. Other workers arriver with the proper PPE and took over assisting the driver to decontaminate. The driver was transported by ambulance and then helicopter to a burn center in Lubbock, TX.   We have not been able to get a statement from the driver who is undergoing medical treatment for chemical burns.   All released material was captured on the concrete drive and spill containment area. Plant personnel treated the material and performed all cleanup activities.",Best practice for receiving dangerous cargo is for the receiver to handle all off loading activities. We see this with other customers where we transport this same type cargo.

These locomotives were taken to the roundhouse area for later decontamination. BNSF and contract responders inspected the cordoned-off GATX 60771. Responders reported that the vapor/air valve was disconnected at the valve's base pipe flange connection and hanging to one side. All four flange stud nuts were missing along with one stud bolt.  Responders correctly repositioned the valve and applied replacement stainless steel bolts and bolt stud nuts. The bolt stud nuts were tool tightened, thus properly securing the valve at its flange connection.

After the Dubai Police opened the mail parcel, it was physically confirmed that the internal contents were shaving cream cans, classified as UN1950, class 2.1 (Aerosols, Flammable).

The release was minimal approximately one pint of vapor.  The release was stopped immediately by tightening the valve.,"The company has a rollover prevention policy titled, ""SLIP OFF STAY OFF"" with cab posters and training reminders.  The idea is to bring the vehicle under control without attempting to radically change the path which can cause liquid load shifting and add to the potential for overturn.  After each such accident a committee reviews the investigative facts to determine whether the driver followed company safety practices and whether disciplinary actions are appropriate.

At approximately 6:19AM Mr. Holmes failed to maintain control of the MMU after the front driver’s side steer tire blew out, causing the vehicle to leave the road and roll over multiple times; coming to rest on its top. The MMU was loaded with approximately 16,000 LBS of Oxidizer emulsion (UN3139), 7,000 LBS of Ammonium Nitrate (UN1942), a quantity of 100 - 1.4 B Detonators (UN0361) and a quantity of 100 - 1.1D Boosters (UN0042).  Approximately 1,500 LBS of ammonium nitrate prill was spilled to the ground, no emulsion was lost from the tank.  Both detonators and boosters remained secured in the onboard IME-22 magazines, undamaged.  A small amount of diesel fuel, engine oil and antifreeze leaked from the vehicle.  Hepaco, LLC, an Orica third party environmental response company, cleaned the incident scene. The cleanup and disposal process was completed to state and federal standards.    The manway covers on the Ammonium Nitrate Bin were ripped off during the rollover and the bin was upside down after coming to rest.    The Ammonium Nitrate exited from the bin through the then uncovered manway.    The cargo tank containing Oxidizer emulsion did not fail nor did the 2 IME-22 containers holding the detonators and boosters.",The cause of the incident is being investigated by a 3rd party accident reconstruction firm.

The spilled material was one of two 275 gallon totes of Moor Floc 5401. The proper shipping name of this material is UN3264, Corrosive Liquid, Acidic, Inorganic, NOS (contains Aluminum Sulfate). The product was intended for delivery to the second delivery address at 2100 Burlingame Avenue, SW, Grand Rapids, MI 49509, but there were a number of trucks lined up for deliveries at the loading dock there, with an estimated 1 hour wait time, so the driver decided to go to the third delivery stop at the 150 Cottage Grove, SW Grand Rapids, MI 49507 location, and return to make the delivery to the 2100 Burlingame customer later.    At the 150 Cottage Grove location, the driver needed to unload the tote of Moor Floc 5401 to be able to offload the products needed by the customer at that location.  So the tote involved in the incident was removed from the truck with the use of an electric pallet jack and set aside on the customer's  loading dock.  The products intended for that customer were unloaded.  The incident occurred when the driver was repositioning the tote of Moor Floc 5401 back on the truck with the pallet jack. The bottom valve assembly caught on the corner of the other tote of Moor Floc 5401 in the truck and completely snapped off. The entire contents of the tote emptied off the back of the truck into the storm drain (an 8""x 15' grate spanning the width of the loading dock, connected to the storm sewer system on the customer property).  The driver attempted to replace the valve to stop the flow, but the break was such as to make this impossible.  Incidental skin contact occurred but was promptly washed off, and no injuries to the driver or any other responder occurred.    The customer's environmental manager and other personnel were already in the near vicinity when the spill occurred. The immediate response was to bring out a tank wagon to suck out the first on-property storm sewer retention chamber. (The storm water system at this location included four retention chambers on the customer's property before connection to the City of Grand Rapids storm sewer line located under Cottage Grove Avenue.)  When testing of the pH of the downstream retention chambers showed carryover of the product, the customer's liquid waste contractor was called to arrange for response by their vac truck. At the same time, the National Response Center, the state Pollution Emergency Action System, and local authorities were notified as a precaution. The Grand Rapids Fire Department responded with a number of emergency vehicles. However, all spilled product was recovered from the four storm water retention chambers on customer  property by the tank wagon and vac truck. The storm water chamber at the junction of the customer's line into the city line was opened for inspection and sampling, but was dry, indicating that no spilled product had migrated beyond the facility limits.    The Broadmoor",1 )  Highly recommend to drivers to wait to make deliveries accord ing to the predetermined sched ule to avoid repositioning or off-loadi ng/on-loading of items in the load.  2)  Be very careful to protect valves on totes in any repositioning maneuvers.  3)  Reinforce need for immediate reporting to persons and agencies for fast response - which in this case was admirably performed by the environmental manager and additional personnel at the customer site. Their fast and effective response prevented any release beyond their property and precluded damage to the environment.,Yes,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and fiberboard outer packaging",31HG1,Yes,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,1782,"BROADMOOR PRODUCTS, INC.",US,

The trailer came to rest on its side with the dome lid facing toward the ground.  The dome lid began to leak around the seal.  The leak was a fairly slow leak until the clean up process began.  The clean up company had to cut a whole in the side of the tanker so they could get access to the acid and then pump it into another trailer.  The leak last for approximately 8 hours.  The acid was contained on the soil on the side of the road.  Berms were made with the soil to keep the acid contained.  Once the trailer was emptied, the acid on the ground was neutralized and then cleaned up using vacuum trucks.  The soil was then remediated to ensure all of the contaminated soil was removed.  Samples of the soil were taken to ensure no contamination remained.  Once the samples confirmed this, clean soil was brought in to replace the contaminated soil.  Arizona Department of Environmental Quality was involved and oversaw the remediation portion of the process.",We have implemented a strict no speeding policy on the highway.  This is a very winding road with no shoulders so there is little tolerance for error.  We have told our drivers by company memo that they are required to travel 10 mph below all posted and recommended speeds on that highway.  We have also sent our safety team out to the highway to have conversations with our drivers and to help enforce the new standard.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,56000,"CTI, Inc",US,

IN THE REVIEW MIRROR, THE DRIVER SAW THE RUNNING GEAR VEER, SLIDE AROUND AND SPIN THE TRUCK INTO THE NORTH DITCH FACING THE WEST. THE REESE HITCH OF THE TRUCK HAS A PITCH PIN CLIP IN IT THAT APPARENTLY CAME OUT AND LET THE TRAILER RECEIVER DISCONNECT FROM THE TRUCK. THIS CAUSED THE NURSE TANKS TO VEER FROM DITCH TO DITCH AND RUN OVER AND TURN OVER AND BREAKING OFF THE VALVES ON ONE OF THE NURSE TANKS, ALLOWING ANYDROUS AMMONIA TO BE RELEASED INTO THE AIR. GREENFIELD FIRE DEPT ARRIVED AT SCENE AT 8.30AM AND STARTED SPRAYING THE CLOUD OF AMMONIA THAT WAS COMING FROM THE NURSE TANK THAT HAD VALVES SHEARED OFF.

He had not been to the location before and was not aware that there were two  heating oil tanks, one 8k, and one 12k. He manually stuck the 8k, but used a 12k  tank chart to determine the ullage (delivery amount tank would accept). He started  dropping the product and, sometime later, heard the product stop flowing. When he  disengaged the delivery hose from the fill, heating oil flowed out of the fill onto  the asphalt driveway and down to a storm sewer entrance. The driver used his spill  kit to dam up the product (later determined to be 7 gallons by the business owner)  and called for assistance. Shipley notified Mountain Research of Altoona, PA and  they responded to the site and completed the cleanup. No product went beyond the  entrance of the storm sewer, but the asphalt lot was old and cracked so PA DEP ordered a site characterization.

APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES PRIOR TO ARRIVING AT UNIVAR OUR DRIVER WAS CRESTING A HILL ON HWY 207 WHEN A PICKUP TRUCK PULLED OUT FROM A HIDDEN DRIVEWAY. OUR DRIVER HAD TO CONDUCT A HARD BARKE EVENT TO AVOID BROAD SIDING THE PICK UP TRUCK.  THIS EVENT CAUSED THE IBC TOTE TO ALL SHIFT FORWARD APPROXIMATELY 8 TO 10 INCHES. USUALLY THE TOTES ARE BLOCKED IN THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER BY A STACK OF WODDEN PALLETS STACKED ABOUT 46 INCHES HIGH WHICH IS THE HEIGHT OF THE TOTES. THIS WILL PREVENT THE TOTES FROM MOVING FORWARD. HOWEVER ON THIS LOAD IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE PALLETS WERE ONLY STACKED AT 24 TO 26 INCHES HIGH. WHEN THE DRIVER HAD TO HARD BRACKE THE SHIFTING TOTES CAUSED THE TOP HALF OF THE TOTE IN FRONT TO FOLD OVER TO THE TOP OF THE PALLETS RUPTURING THE FRONT PALLET JUST ABOVE THE 1/2 WAY POINT ON THE TOTE. THIS CAUSED THE SLOW LEAK OF APPROXIMATELY 127 GALLONS OF BLEACH. DURING THE NEXT 5 MILES TO UNIVAR THE DRIVER DID NOT HAVE ANY IDEA THERE WAS A LEAK. THE PRODUCT PULLED UP IN THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER. IT WAS WHEN THE DRIVER BEGAN BACKING INTO THE DOCK AT UNIVAR IT WAS DISCOVERED THERE WAS A LEAK. OUR DRIVER AND UNIVAR USED BOOMS TO DIKE UP THE BLEACH AND CALLED IN A VAC TRUCK TO PICK UP THE SPILLED PRODUCT. SOME ABSORBENT WAS USED AS WELL TO DIKE UP THE BLEACH TO CONTAIN AND CLEAN UP. TWO IBC WERE USED TO RETURN PRODUCT TO PETRA ALONG WITH 3 BARRELS USED FOR ABSORBENT AND USED BOOMS.","IT WAS DETERMINED AND DISCUSSED WITH THE SHIPPER THAT A FULL STACK OF WOODEN PALLETS HAS TO BE USED TO PREVENT SHIFTING OF TOTES WHILE IN TRANSIT.
