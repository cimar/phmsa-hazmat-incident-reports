AT APPROXIMATELY 2:30 PM OUR TRANSPORTER TRAILER, #T4, (MASSACHUSETTS REGISTRATION 26726) RETURNED TO OUR FACILITY IN STOUGHTON AFTER LEAKING #4 FUEL OIL LOADED AT THE SAME FACILITY.  THE RELEASE WAS THE RESULT OF AN IMPROPER SEATING OF AN INTERNAL VENT.  THIS DEVICE IS USED TO ALLOW OUTSIDE AIR TO ENTER THE TANK WHILE THE LOAD IS BEING DISCHARGED,  THIS UNIT HAD JUST RECEIVED AN EXTENSIVE OVERHAUL AND APPARENTLY THE LINKAGE THAT CONNECTS THE VENT AND VALVE WAS OUT OF ALIGNMENT.  UPON RETURNING TO STOUGHTON, THE MECHANICS INSPECTED THIS VEHICLE AND DETERMINED THE PROBLEM.  THE MECHANICS DISCONNECTED THE LINKAGE ALLOWING THE VENT TO SEAL TIGHTLY AND NO FURTHER DISCHARGE COULD TAKE PLACE.  CLAIRE FITZGERALD, FROM STOUGHTON OPERATIONS, WAS SENT TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE SPILL ON CANTON, BROOK AND CENTRAL STREETS.  SHE COMPLETED ASSESSMENT AND CALLED FOR A CREW TO COMMENCE A CLEAN UP.  CLAIRE REPORTED THAT SHE DID NOT NOTICE ANY FREE LIQUID ON THE ROAD AND ONLY SOME STAINING.  THIS STAINING STARTED AT THE END OF JET-LINE'S DRIVEWAY ON CANTON STREET AND SPORADICALLY DOWN BROOK STREET ONTO CENTRAL STREET TO A POINT WHERE IT INTERSECTS SIMPSON STREET.  THE ESTIMATED TOTAL AMOUNT RELEASED WAS FIVE (5) TO FIFTEEN(15) GALLONS.  ON RECEIVING NOTICE OF THE RELEASE, THE FOLLOWING AGENCIES WERE IMMEDIATELY NOFIFIED: MA DEP, LAKEVILLE OFFICE, STOUGHTON FIRE DEPARTMENT, STOUGHTON HAZARDOUS WASTE COORDINATOR AND MR CHARLES STARKOWSKY.  AT APPROXIMATELY 3:15 PM LIEUTENANT FAVRETT, OF THE STOUGHTON FIRE DEPARTMENT, ARRIVED AT JET-LINE SERVICES.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT HE WOULD RETRACE THE TRUCK'S ROUTE FROM THE FACILITY.  HIS INVESTIGATION CONCURRED WITH JET-LINE'S REPORT.  THE ONLY VISIBLE EVIDENCE WAS SOME STAINING OF THE AFFECTED ROADS AND A SMALL AREA OF HEAVY STAIN AT THE END OF BROOK STREET AT THE INTERSECTION WITH CENTRAL STREET.  OUR PERSONNEL WERE DIRECTED TO LAY DOWN SPEEDY-DRY (APPROXIMATELY TEN (10) POUNDS TO ABSORB ANY PRODUCT IN THIS AREA AS A PRECAUTION.  AT APPROXIMATELY 3:25 PM , WE WERE JOINED BY REGINA MCCARTHY, OF THE STOUGHTON BOARD OF HEALTH.  WE DISCUSSED WHAT HAD OCCURRED AND WOULD FOLLOW-UP ON ANY QUESTIONS SHE RAISED.  UPON COMPLETION OF THE CLEAN-UP, LIEUTENANT FAVRETT AND I RETURNED TO STOUGHTON, INTERVIEWED THE DRIVER, MECHANICS AND DETERMINED THAT THE VEHICLE COULD PROCEED TO ITS DESTINATION.  OUR MECHANIC IN MAINE HAD BEEN INSTRUCTED TO INSPECT AND REPAIR THE INTERNAL SYSTEM ON THIS TRAILER.  I ALSO DISCUSSED THIS TRAILER WITH OUR MAIN OPERATIONS COORDINATOR AND SPECIAL ATTENTION AND INSPECTIONS WILL ACCOMPANY THIS UNIT.

THE FIRST THING I DID AFTER I GOT MY TRUCK SPOTTED WAS GO ON TOP OF THE TANK.  THERE WAS NO RELEASE OF PRODUCT AT THIS POINT.  I THOUGHT BECAUSE THE PRODUCT DID NOT SEEM TO BE AGAINST THE DOME OR THE RUPTURE DISC AREA THAT IT WOULD BE OK TO START THE AIR INTO THE TANK AND THEN OPEN THE VALVE, HOOKED THE DISCHARGE HOSE TO CUSTOMERS OUTLET AND TANK AND WAS ON MY WAY TO OPEN THE DISCHARGE VALVE. BEFORE I STARTED UP THE LADDER THE RUPTURE DISC BROKE, ALLOWING A FULL STREAM OF PRODUCT TO FLOW FROM IT'S HOSE.  RIGHT-A-WAY I SHUT THE AIR FLOW OFF AND OPENED THE DISCHARGE VALVE IN HOPES THAT THIS WOULD ALLOW THE PRODUCT TO STOP FLOWING FROM THE DISC HOSE.  THIS DID NOT STOP THE FLOW SO I SHUT THE DISCHARGE VALVE, RAN DOWN AND UNHOOKED THE HOSE AND PULLED THE TRUCK TO LEVEL GROUND, AT THIS POINT THE FLOW STOPPED.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE RUPTURE DISC BROKE PREMATURELY.  THERE WAS ONLY 12 P.S.I. ON THE GAUGE.  THIS MAY HAVE OCCURED BECAUSE THE PRODUCT DID IN FACT GET IN THE DOME AREA.  I'M NOT SURE WHY THIS HAPPENED.  TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURING AGAIN #1-I WILL NOT APPLY AIR TO A TANK WITH A RUPTURE DISC IF THERE IS ANY POSSIBILITY OF PRODUCT GETTING TO IT, UNTIL I HAVE OPENED THE DISCHARGE VALVE.  #2-IF WE COULD PUT A VALVE IN THE LINE BEHIND THE RUPTURE DISC, IF THIS EVER HAPPENS AGAIN, AT LEAST THERE WOULD BE A WAY TO STOP THE FLOW OF PRODUCT FAST.",,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,7012,,US,

PLEASE REFER TO THE ATTACHED REPORT FOR THE SPECIFIC DETAILS. CERTIFIED #P 292 899 447 ATTACHED REPORT: ON THE MORNING OF TUESDAY AUGUST 7, 1990 AT +- 8:30AM, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THOMAS SWERDAN WHO IS A SPILL INVESTIGATOR FOR N.Y.S. DEPT. OF ENVIROMENTAL CONSERVATION.  MR SWERDAN INFORMED ME THAT ONE OF OUR DRIVERS HAD A SPILL OF #2 FUEL OIL AT MECEHNICVILLE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND HE ASKED IF WE WERE AWARE OF IT.  I SAID THAT NO ONE HAD REPORTED ANY SPILL OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE DELIVERY TO CARMAN TRAUCKING.  WE THEN AGREED TO MEET AT THE SPILL SITE. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SCHOOL, I FOUND A SHEEN OF OIL FLOATING ON SOME PUDDLES AND THAT SEVERAL PILES OF SAND HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO COVER SOME OF THE OIL AS WELL AS TO BLOCK OF THE STORM DRAINS FROM RECEIVING ANY FURTHER CONTAMIANTION RUN-OFF.  MR SWERDAN FROM DEC AND MYSELF THEN WENT DOWN ALONG THE RIVER TO WHERE THE STORM DRAIN EMPTIES OUT. THERE WAS A VISIBLE SHEEN OF OIL ALONG THE SHORE, BUT IT WAS SO THIN THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO ABSORB ANY OF IT.  I THEN PLACED AN OIL ABSORBING BOOM AND PADS AROUND THE STORM DRAIN OUTLET TO CATCH ANY FURTHER OIL THAT MIGHT COME OUT. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE OIL WE WERE DELIVERING WAS LEFT OVER FROM A DELIVERY TO THE MECHANICVILLE HIGH SCHOOL.  THE SCHOOL HAD ORDERED TWO LOADS OF FUEL FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL, BUT THE SECOND LOAD WOULDN'T FIT SO THE SCHOOL SENT OUR DRIVER TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH THE BALANCE OF THE LOAD.  AFTER DELIVERY OF THE REMAINING PRODUCT OUR DRIVER WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE WHEN DICK (THE SCHOOL'S BOILERMAN), HOLLERED BACK UP TO THE DRIVER THAT ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE BOILERROOM HE HAD FOUND OIL ON THE LOWER FIELD. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR DRIVER & DICK CLEANED UP ALL OIL THEY SAW AT THAT POINT. BUT NEITHER OUR DRIVER, BILL WHITEHOUSE, NOR THE SCHOOL'S EMPLOYEE NOTIFIED J.A. CARMAN TRUCKING OF ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE DELEIVERY AS THEY SHOULD HAVE. I BELEIVE THAT AFTER CLEANING UP THE OIL AND LEAVING, THE HEAVY RAINS CONTINUED TO FLUSH OIL OUT FROM CONTAMINATED SOIL AROUND THE STICK HOLE AND FLOATED IT OUT ONTO THE LOWER FIELD AND INTO THE STORM DRAINS WHERE IT WAS NOTICED BY BOATERS WHO CALLED CITY POLICE AND FIRE OFFICALS WHO NOTIFIED D.E.C.",,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,3675,,US,

DUNBAR IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND SECURED HIS VEHICLE, AND SAW THE PRODUCT LEAKING FROM THE FIRST TOTE TANK CLOSEST TO THE CAB.  HE FLAGGED DOWN A PASSING MOTORIST HEADING EAST BACK INTO BEGGS, AND ASKED THE DRIVER TO NOTIFY THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS, AND HAVE THEM CALL KEN WILDBUR, JR.. DUNBAR REMAINED WITH HIS VEHICLE. WILDBUR CALLED ME AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00 AM., AND NOTIFIED T. CHILDERS AND D. CLARK, AND ASKED THEM TO BEGIN PREPARING FOR A RESPONSE TO THE SPILL.  BEGGS POLICE AND FIRE OFFICIALS NOTIFIED THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND STATE HIGHWAY DEPARTMENT AND BEGAN ISOLATING THE APPROXIMATE 4-MILE STRETCH OF HIGHWAY 16 WHERE THE CHEMICAL HAD BEEN SPILLED.  THE LEAK BEGAN WTH THE FAILURE OF A PVC 2"" NIPPLE BETWEEN THE STAINLESS MOUNTING PLATE FOR THE UNLOADING VALVE ASSEMBLY AND THE END VALVE ITSELF, AND HAD BEGUN APPROXIMATLEY 1 MILE EAST OF BEGGS, CONTINUING THROUGH TOWN AND 2 MILES WEST.  DUNBAR WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE LEAKING LIQUID IN THE DARK, AND DID NOT REALIZE HE HAD LEAK UNTIL THE PASSING VEHICLE FLASHED ITS LIGHTS.  CHEMLINK RESPONSE PERSONNEL WERE ASSEMBLED AT THE PLANT BY 6:00 AM., AND DEPARTED SAND SPRINGS AT 7:00.  T. CHILDERS, J. PETERSON, T. BEASON, J. VANN. AND J. HUGO RESPONDED WITH TWO TRUCKS, THE ERT TRAILER, AND AN EMPTY TOTE TANK AND TRANSFER PUMP TO SECURE ANY PRODUCT REMAINING IN THE LEAKING TANK.  ... THE REMAINING 150 GALLONS IN THE TANK WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE EMPTY TOTE TANK, POOLED WATER/PRODUCT MIXTURES ALONG THE SPILL ROUTE WERE CLEANED UP AND PLACED INTO OPEN TOP DRUMS, AND THE SPILLED PRODUCT ON AND UNDER THE TRUCK WAS CLEANED UP AND THEN WASHED DOWN BY A FIRE TRUCK.  MARVIN BOATRIGHT, ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES DIVISION, OKLAHOMA STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, RECOMMENDED THAT THE DRUMMED MATERIAL BE TRANFERRED TO THE OKMULGEE COUNTY LANDFILL IN MORRIS....CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT: A 2"" PVC NIPPLE BETWEEN THE STAINLESS STEEL MOUNTING PLATE AND STAINLESS STEEL UNLOADING VALVE FAILED, DUE TO VIBRATION OR STRESS DURING PREVIOUS UNLOADING ACTIVITES.  TWO MORE TOTE TANKS USED FOR HS 9767 WERE ALSO FOUND WITH PVC UNLOADING VALVE ASSEMBLY COMPONENTS, AND HAVE BEEN TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE.  RECOMMENDATIONS:  1. PVC COMPONENTS SHOULD NOT BE UTILIZED IN ANY PORTION OF THE UNLOADING VALVE ASSEMBLY ON TOTE TANKS FOR CORROSIVE SERVICE. 2. UNLOADING VALVE ASSEMBLIES SHOULD BE SUPPORTED IF POSSIBLE TO RELIEVE STRESS FROM UNLOADING ACTIVITIES.  3.
