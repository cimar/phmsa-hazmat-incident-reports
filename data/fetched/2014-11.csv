The contents was eroding the foam insulation and causing some surface erosion on a couple of floor cross members on the ocean container.  The leak appeared to be small as it was only dripping on the vessel deck infrequently. The vessel Captain notified the vessel superintendent and safety manager.  A NRC Report was made with NRC case #1099986 and was later updated to number case #1100008 when the actual product was identified.  There were several acids in the container but it was difficult to determine which one was leaking.  We contacted an emergency response contractor who met the ship upon docking Sunday Morning at 6:00.  An assessment was made, the container was ""diapered"" and removed to the dock an positioned in a location to allow them to unload the shipment to determine the cause of the leak.  The vessel was decontaminated and neutralized to stop the activity of the sodium hydroxide.  The USCG observed the actions taken place.  The cause of the leak was abrasion on the drum which caused a pin hole leak.  This could possibly have been caused by loading a pallet next to the drum and sliding the pallet along the plastic packaging compromising its structure.  The cargo cleaned and neutralized and was transferred to another container.  The old container is being cleaned and may be put out of service due to the corrosion from the Sodium Hydroxide.",Care should be taken during the loading and unloading operations to ensure that no packages are damaged.

He said that the hose that was attached to his pump outlet got a hole in it.  He was standing by the control and was able to shut down immediately to minimize the spill.  Customer is handling clean up. He is waiting to see if someone can bring him another section of hose so he can complete the offload.    Driver said the hose looked okay when he hooked up.  He will bring it back to the OC for inspection, however it'll be hard to impossible to determine what caused the unseen hole to develop.  It could be from the wash process the tankwash used or simply degredation of the hose over time.     Spill didn't last longer than 30 minutes.",All hoses are pressure tested annually and inspected at sustainment events as well as the driver prior to each delivery.  Knowing that the hole in the hose developed 30 minutes into the offload indicates the driver would not have been aware simply by looking.  There was no obvious signs of abrasion or damage from cleaning.  The driver followed the right process by remaining near the controls to shut down right away.

The car was isolated and Domtar Paper Company LLC was notified via CHEMTREC Report # 2014-1104-00120.  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the manway cover gasket was misaligned, and the pressure relief device was broken and leaking.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shippers representative.  Contractor personnel installed a new manway nozzle gasket and secured the manway cover.  Contractor personnel then returned on a separate date and installed compliant pressure relief device.  The car will be released for transportation under a One Time Movement Approval so that it can moved to destination for offload; and subsequently moved to home shop for a bubble leak test.

As the result of the rollover, the tanker was damaged, releasing approximately 75-100 gallons of Sodium Hypochlorite solution to the roadway and a 5'x15' area of soil on the shoulder. Haz-tech Environmental responded out of Ripley, WV to assess, mitigate, and clean the release.The blacktop was completely cleaned, and the tanker trailer was up-righted and material transloaded prior to movement.

Yesterday our Train Crew detected an odor coming from UTLX 200298, and made all appropriate notifications. The area was isolated, and KMX Chemical representatives responded from New Church, VA to asses. Upon arrival, they ascended the car with members from DNREC, and determined the car to be releasing a small amount of vapor with an inconsistent flow from multiple locations. These personnel found multiple hardware to be less than tool tight, as well as a bent vapor valve base and malfunctioning vacuum relief device. There efforts were able to slow the release, however not eliminate it completely. I therefore dispatched HEPACO-REACT, our Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Contractor to assist.     HEPACO-REACT provided photos (of which 3 are attached). The vacuum relief device was removed, and upon removal, found to be inoperable and in poor condition, and a solid plug was installed. The vapor valve was removed and found that the welded nipple on the valve assembly plate was bent, thus evidenced by leaning of the valve assembly. A solid plug was installed in its place. The liquid valve was removed, and found an inordinate amount of sealant putty / tape was used causing an ineffective seal. Those threads were cleaned, new sealant placed, and the valve was returned to proper orientation to include the plug.     Additionally, the man way was inspected and found 2 bolts to be less than tool tight, man way gasket was in good order. All man way cover bolts were returned to tool tight. The bottom outlet valve cap was found to be less than tool tight, and the gasket in poor condition. The gasket was replaced, and returned to tool tight.     At this point the car is secure and no longer leaking. Norfolk Southern will fulfill the FRA5800 reporting requirement. The next step is to have this car removed for repairs, which will require an OTMA.

Reportedly there was a slight vapor cloud visible from the Vapor line at the PRV. The tank car was isolated. The consignee, Tetra Technologies, was notified directly to respond and assist in securing the release. The shipper Arkema was notified via Chemtrec, report #2014-1110-00035 . Ron Anderson 304 488 5419 from Tetra Technologies was dispatched to the Parkersburg Yard. Ron Anderson found that the PRV was in fact releasing vapor due to a blown frangible disk. The frangible disk was replaced and the release was thus secured. GATX 62613 was then placed back in transportation. This incident did not require a special move.

As a result of the puncture, approximately 5,600 gallons of NA1993 Combustible fuel oil (diesel fuel) was released onto the soil & gravel at the CSX railyard and into a nearby retention pond. As a response, Hulls Environmental and ERS were dispatched to the scene to mitigate the release impact and prevent further migration of the fuel.

The consignee's unloading service provider (Savage Services) inspection of GBRX 701027 revealed its liquid valve was open and this valve's closure plug not applied.  The liquid valve was closed and its closure plug was applied to a tool tight condition. The shipper seal at the protective housing cover (Allied 1585186) was reported intact. Also noted was commodity spray on four entrained tank cars that trailed GBRX 701027. Savage Services indicated that they would clean the commodity spillage from GBRX 701027 and the other tank cars found with sprayed commodity. The outage in GBRX 701027 was gauged to estimate the possible commodity loss during transportation.

UTLX 206580 was isolated in the railyard for a detailed inspection. The spillage on UTLX 206580's side shell mostly evaporated and no ground impact from the spillage was observed. Contract responders inspecting UTLX 206580 reported the source of the commodity release was from its reclosing 165 psig pressure relief valve (PRV).  The PRV was suspected of incurring either a broken stem or spring. The PRV was not removed to verify the cause of failure. The responders inserted wedges to gag off the PRV preventing any further commodity release. Non-evaporated spillage was wiped.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected CTCX 733042 and reported all six manway securement eyebolts were not applied and hanging downward. No shipper seal was found at the manway closure. The responder applied the eyebolts and secured the manway closure. CTCX 733042 was moved and isolated in the railyard for cleaning by contract responders. On 11/29/2014 contract responders re-inspected CTCX 733042 prior to cleaning commodity from its side shell. The outage within CTCX 733042 was measured. The responders installed a new manway nozzle gasket. The manway closure was properly secured ensuring all securement eyebolts were in a tool tight condition. Seal numbered 827329 was applied at the manway closure. All other valves and fittings were found secure. The spillage on CTCX 7330420 was treated with a biodegradable detergent and wiped. No ground spillage was observed at the site.  The outage in CTCX 733042 that was gauged was used to calculate an estimate of possible commodity loss during transportation. No reports of commodity spillage along the BNSF routed right of way have been noted.,Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,Yes,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,2920,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The replacement included the entire valve assembly with a new gage-arm. It was determined that the old tank gage had broken at the elbow of the gage arm inside the truck's tank. Subsequently, the arm no longer attached fell to the bottom of the bob-tail's tank. Consequently, when the driver began to unload, the broken gage arm migrated to the open valve due to the force imparted by draining the tank via gravity flow.The broken arm was lodged inside the valve preventing the driver to place the valve in the close position.Upon further inspection the mechanics found the tip of the gage-arm had wedged the valve in the OPEN position. Consequently, 10 gallons of produced water was released.",This truck was originally configured with no loading/unloading valve after the DOT valve.

We transferred the load to another trailer without further incident.,"It appears that as our driver was going up the steep grade, the product moved towards the rear of the trailer, got into the rear clean-out pipe.  the clean-out cap leaked which is what our driver saw when he pulled over.  When we had the trailer purged, cleaned an inspected the cargo tank facility could not find anything wrong.  They though maybe the clean-out cap was a little loose, or possibly the threads were damaged or the clean-out cap itself was deformed so they replaced the clean-out cap.

During routine inspection of trailer at truck stop, a leak was discovered on back of trailer. Site was secured, and SWS Environmental was dispatched to perform the cleanup. Upon arrival on site, free product was noted on back of trailer tailgate, but no leak was detected inside trailer. SWS Environmental applied absorbent material and pads to the trailer floor, as a precaution, and followed the RRTS, Inc. trailer to their facility in Mt. Joliet, TN. Upon arrival, SWS Environmental proceeded to offload the trailer to determine cause of release. One (1) 15-gallon drum of free product was discovered. Apparently, a pinhole leak in bottom of drum, resulted in loss of contents from the damaged drum. Free product was contained to the trailer floor, which was recovered and containerized into one (1) 55 gallon recovery drum, pending disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations. The damaged drum was also over packed into a recovery drum, pending disposition. There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Roadrunner Transportation Services, Inc. will continue to train and reinforce safe handling procedures and driver safety to all personnel.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7100,SPILL CENTER INC,US,

All concerned were notified. KCS dispatched a hazmat responder. Upon arrival the responder determined that the lading was leaking from the BOV . The bottom outlet valve handle was not pinned or secured and was approximately one-quarter open. The two (2) inch plug in the bottom outlet cap was not tool tight. The responder closed the bottom outlet valve and pinned the handle. The two (2) inch plug was removed, thread sealant was applied and the plug was tool tightened. Security seal 456712 was applied to the bottom outlet valve handle. The spilled product was cleaned up to prevent a slipping hazard for yard workers.     File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

Driver was heading north on I45 to Waxahachie, Tx with a load from HAT Ammonia in Houston, Tx when driver noticed the relief valve was weeping. Luck be that our field service tech was going south and turned around to follow the driver. Service tech started smelling ammonia, so after discussions with upper management we made the decision to find a safe haven off the interstate to park and put a plan into action. Driver called 911 and I called NRC and Chemtrec to report and let them know we had a plan in place and was executing it. We arrived approx. 9 pm witha empty ammonia trailer and a field service van with equipment to transfer product from leaking trailer to good trailer. All went as planned with no issues. We had one person from the sheriffs department there to help with traffic. After our investigation the next day, looks like baffle broke inside and bent the PRV.

The transport driver ran to the nearest post and hit the plant emergency stop button. Next he ran to the cab of the tractor and turned off the key switch which stopped the motor of the tractor then ran to the business office and shut off the main electric breaker for the property. After this action, he then ran through the forming gas cloud along a paved driveway to an business which was occupied with individuals who were in fitness classes and alerted the persons to potential danger. When he entered the building, the gas vapors contacted an ignition source and the vapors flashed into a fire ball. The remaining escaping product was consumed by the fire but the radiated heat from the fire and the some exposure during the flash fire resulted in neighboring buildings igniting and burning. The persons in the fitness center escaped through a broken window which was facing away from the fire scene.

THE ACTIVITY REQUIRED THAT A STRAIGHT TRUCK PULL THE FULL BIN FROM BENEATH THE PRESS, MOVE IT OUT OF THE WAY, PLACE IT BACK ON THE GROUND, AND THEN PLACE A NEW EMPTY BIN BENEATH THE PRESS. ONCE THE EMPTY CONTAINER HAS BEEN PLACED BENEATH THE PRESS, THE DRIVER AND GLOBALFOUNDRIES PERSONNEL PREPARE THE FULL BIN FOR SHIPMENT WHILE THE CONTAINER IS ON THE GROUND (INSPECTION, CONVER, PLACARDS, ETC.). THE DRIVER THEN LOADS THE BIN AND SECURES IT TO THE TRUCK. ONCE IT IS SECURE, GLOBALFOUNDRIES PERSONNEL WILL INSPECT THE TRUCK AND SIGN THE SHIPPER PAPARWORK TO RELEASE THE TRUCK.     THE RELEASE OCCURRED BECUASE MATERIAL SLOGHED OVER THE BACK END OF THE BIN AS THE STRAIGHT TRUCK OPERATOR WAS LOWERING THE BIN BACK TO THE GROUND SO THAT AN EMPTY BIN COULD BE PLACED BENEATH THE PRESS. THE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE WAS THAT THE MATERIAL HAD AN UNACCEPTABLE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE AND HAD NOT BEEN APPROPRIATELY STABILIZED. GLOBALFOUONDRIES PERSONNEL REPORTED THAT A PREVIOUS CLEANING ACTIVITY HAD LED TO WATER ACCUMULATING IN THE BIN. PERSONNEL ATTEMPTED TO DEWATER THE BIN PRIOR TO REMOVAL, BUT HAD REMOVED A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT MOISTURE.    THE GLOBALFOUNDRIES ONSITE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM (ERT) RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY TO CONTAIN THE RELEASE. THE FLOW OF MATERIAL HAD ALREADY BEEN STOPPED BY RAISING THE CONTAINER BACK ONTO THE TRUCK. THE ERT IMMEDIATELY BLOCKED THE STORM DRAIN USING A CATCH BASIN COVER AND ABSORBENT BOOMS/PADS TO PREVENT ADDITIONAL MATERIAL FROM SEEPING INTO THE STRUCTURE.    THE GLOBALFOUNDRIES ERT RESPONSE TRAILER WAS MOBILIZED TO THE SCENE AND THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM (ICS) WAS IMPLEMENTED TO BEGIN THE CLEANUP AND DECON OF THE AREA. ERT PERSONNEL REMOVED THE BULK OF THE MATERIAL MANUALLY AND PLACED INTO DRUMS. THE IMPACTED GRAVEL AREA WAS SCRAPPED AND SCOURED TO REMOVE ALL VISIBLY IMPACTED MATERIAL. THE ASPHALT AREA WAS THEN FURTHER CLEANED USING SPEEDIE-DRI. SPEEDIE-DRI WAS THE REMOVED AND DRUMMED AS WELL.    THERE ARE NO HAZARDOUS CHARACTERISTICS (IGNITABILITY, REACTIVITY, TOXICITY, OR CORROSIVITY) ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SLUDGE. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS SLUDGE IS GENERATED FROM THE TREATMENT OF ELECTROPLATING WASTEWATERS, THIS MATERIAL CARRIES THE F006 HAZARDOUS WASTE CODE.",THE FOLLOWING ACITONS WILL BE TAKEN BY GLOBALFOUNDRIES TO PREVENT RECURRENCE:    * MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES WILL BE REVISED TO EMPHASIZE CONTROLS TO PREVENT MOISTURE FROM ENTERING THE ROLLOFF;  * GLOBALFOUNDRIES PERSONNEL WILL INSPECT THE ROLLOFF BIN FOR EVIDENCE OF MOISTURE PRIOR TO REMOVAL FROM BENEATH THE FILTER PRESS; AND  * NO ROLLOFF BINS WITH EVIDENCE OF EXCESSIVE MOISTURE WILL BE REMOVED FROM BENEATH THE FILTER PRESS UNTIL THE MATERIAL HAS BEEN APPROPRIATELY STABILIZED.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10000,GLOBALFOUNDRIES,US,
