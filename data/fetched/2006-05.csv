The truck pump had a 3"" to 2"" reducer with the 3"" connected to the pump and the 2"" to the hose. A velcro strap was around the lock down ears during unloading. Toluene leaked from the truck pump and the hose for less than 1 minute. Employees in attendance of the unloading immediately turned off the pump, put absorbant material on the concrete to contain the spill and soaked up the spill. The customer removed the contaminated absorbant material.",The incident has been reviewed with all company truck drivers.  The velcro straps used to hold the coupler lock down ears in place have been inspected and replaced if old and worn.

This was discovered during an un-loading process at our Albuquerque terminal.

The accident occurred on a two lane highway US 331 south, 9 miles south of Defuniak Springs, Florida.  The accident was the result of another tractor trailer rear ending our vehicle causing damage to an additional four other vehicles stopped behind the turning vehicle.  Our unit was loaded with 56 drums of Sulfuric Acid secured by two e-track type load bars behind the last eight drums loaded. The load bar was bent by the force of the impact allowing three drums to fall over onto the floor of the trailer.  The responders required several hours before the rear door of the trailer could be opened. During this extened period a minor leak developed between the closure and threads of one drum resulting in a slow drip of product estimated at no more than 2 gallons.  Once the rear door of the trailer was opened, the drums were uprighted by responders and the small amount of Sulfuric Acid was collected.  All spillage was contained within the vehicle with no safety related consequences or impact to the environment.",The trailer was loaded with sufficient blocking and bracing to prevent movement during transportation.  The packaging was sufficient for the material contained within. The closures were confirmed as having met the requirement according to the closure instructions.  All procedures were following by personnel packaging the material and loading the containers onto the transport unit.  It is difficult to anticipate this type of incident resulting from a tractor trailer driver not paying attention to traffic stopped on the highway and impacting our vehicle at a high rate of speed.,No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,56,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,22501,,,

The air line was charged (32 psi) and the employee felt the unloading line to see if product was beginning to transfer.  After the line was checked, the employee was leaving the unloading platform when he felt something spraying him from behind.  The employee turned around to discover the unloading line had ruptured at the tank car end of the unloading hose fitting.      The employee, covered in a spray of 50% caustic, headed for the safety chemical shower station to wash off his face and neck.  When the employee saw how bad the caustic leak was and that it was continuing to spray, the employee went back into the Hot Zone to cut off the air supply to the rail car.    The chemical rated 2"" line ruptured just above the railcar end of the unloading hose/fitting connection.  The failure of the hose was approximately 3"" or 1/2 the circumference of the hose.    From the time the line rupture began and was then isolated, approximately three minutes passed.  An additional one minute passed with the product seeping out of the line once the air supply was shut off.    Measures were taken to prevent the caustic soaked paper lying on the ground under the railcar from blowing away.  The area was flagged off and access limited to authorized personnel only.","The chemical rated hose that was in use and failed was re-evaluated and replaced with another chemical rated hose of a different brand, believed to be of better quality.  The hose connection points have been modified to relieve certain stresses on the unloading hose, thus reducing risk of premature failure.  Other modifications are being discussed to include relocation of air supply line valve for safer operation by employee and spill containment  improvements.",No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1283,Abitibi Consolidated Snowflake Division,US,

Southern Waste Services of Savannah, Georgia was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon inspection, three (3) 1-gallon plastic jugs within the carton, were discovered damaged, and had released their contents.  Southern Waste Services applied absorbent pads to the free liquid, wiped down the adjacent freight, and repalletized the remainder of the shipment.  Southern Waste Services overpacked the three (3) damaged jugs, spent absorbent pads, and contaminated cardboard into two (2) 30-gallon overpack drums.  Two (2) 30-gallon overpack drums were left on site pending disposition from the shipper.

Driver then placed a plastic container under drip to catch any material and placed absorbent pads under container and around lacal area. Driver then notified local fire department and called ER number on manifest. Then notified company of the possible leak. The material listed on the manifest was identified and and a local response team RMCAT was notified. RMCAT personal arrived on the scene at approximately 0230 hrs. RMCAT conducted a a site health evaluation and safety meeting to address any potential hazards. A small drip was identified from the trailer. A PID was used to detect volitile vapors near the leak. The PID did pick up some vapors above 300 ppm. The trailer doors where then opened and allowed to ventilate for approx 15 minutes. RMCAT then doned full face respirators with organic vapor cartridges and polyethylene coated tyvek suits to enter the trailer. An extended reach forklift was brought on site to help unload the trailer. The drums where unloaded and rearranged until the leaking drums were found. A total of three drums were discovered leaking. The first had a loose bung and the ring was not tightened down all the way. There was a viscous material all over the sides of the drum. Therefore the drum was overpacked and relabeled. The other two, in the very front of the trailer had tight bungs, but but the ring was tightened down all the way. The drums were resealed and moved to decon the trailer floor. Extra pads were laid down for any residual materials that may weep out of the wood floor. All drums were reloaded and secured. The trailer exterior was then wiped down and the driver was released. RMCAT departed the site at approx. 1030 hrs.",Shipper needs to adapt a better quality control program to ensure cargo being shipped is better prepared for transportation.

Witnesses indicate heavy rain and high wind at the time of the accident.  Bellflower Fire Department and Illinois State Police responded immediately. Illinois Environmental Protection Agency arrived shortly thereafter. ICI Midwest, owner of the tractor trailer was notified at 1615 hrs, May 12, 2006. Informed that trailer rear compartment had ruptured and diesel fuel spilled. Rear compartment split at seam weld about 18-24 inches long  Bodine Environmental dispatched by ICI Midwest and arrvied on scene approxiamtely 1715 hrs. Bodine immediately set containment to keep spilled fuel from moving down through the field. ICI Midwest arrived with tractor trailer to remove residual fuel from the wrecked trailer. ICI Midwest informed upon arrival that the driver had been killed because he was ejected during the rollover. Bodine Environmental cold-drilled the wrecked trailer and approximately 2400 gallons of diesel fuel was recovered by pumping into the second ICI Midwest trailer. 5100 gallon of diesel spilled into the farm field and largely soaked into the soil.  Recovery of wreck was completed by 11 pm and roadway opened.  At 0700, May 13, 2006, Bodine Environmental and Burns & McDonnell, remediation consultant, met with ICI Midwest and outlined a remediation plan.  The ILEPA was briefed and approved the plan.  An intervention trench was completed and multiple extraction wells were sunk over the next few days to contain and remove diesel fuel from the soil.  Test bores indicate the spill spread has been stopped and the spill contained in a specified area of the soil.  Remediation and extraction efforts swill ontinue for the foreseeable future until ILEPA is satisfied the spill effects have been remedied.","An operational assessment is currently underway at ICI Midwest.  Illinois State Police and Department of Transportation reports indicate tractor and trailer were sound and without defect prior to the accident.  Equipment was current for tests and inspections including satisfactory roadside DOT stops in recent months.  State Police surmise driver would have survived accident if not ejected from the cab.  They surmise he was not wearing the seatbelt. Drivers have been reminded of Illinois law regarding seatbelt use and Company policy for use.  Since the accident site has had multiple rollover accidents in recetn years, all drivers have been instructed not to use the roadway unless it is the only means to a delivery location.  Drivers have been advised to reduce speed below the 45 mph posting on the specific curve.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,966170,"ICI Midwest, LLC",US,

THE LEAK RATE WAS ABOUT A HALF GALLON EVERY HALF HOUR AND ABOUT 30 GALLONS HAD LEAKED TO THE DECK AND WAS POOLING ON THE PORT SIDE.  THE DANGEROUS CARGO MANIFEST WAS CONSULTED REVEALED NO HAZARDOUS INFORMATION ON THE CONTAINER IN QUESTION.  THE CREW STARTED EXIBITING BURNING EYES FROM THE STRONG VAPORS, AND THERE WAS NAUSEA AND SOME BREATHING PROBLEMS.  CONTACT WAS MADE NOTED AS ANOTHER CARRIER CARGO, SEA STAR, THE OTHER CARRIER, WAS CONTACTED ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND CONFIRMED THE NON HAZARDOUS CONTENTS OF THE CONTAINER- BASED ON THE SHIPPERS BILLING (AQUA GULF).to Sea Star. The Captain was very concerned about the fumes from the cargo so he proceeded to wash down the non hazardous cargo from the deck of the vessel to reduce the hazard to the crew. This was communicated to the National Response Center.  Horizon’s hazmat manager contacted Aqua Gulf and Sea Star and requested a packaging list of the container contents to try and determine the type of product leaking based on the volume leaking and the packaging. It was hoped that the packaging list would contain information on any large packaging that could be the source of the leak. A couple of hours later, Aqua Gulf phoned and advised that their shipper, APA, had loaded 3 drums of hazardous cargo into the container. I asked for the detailed information to communicate with the Captain on the Horizon Producer. They said that they would provide it as soon the shipper provided it to them. I asked for the hazardous information by phone to communicate with the Captain. They provided me a Material Safety Data Sheet which listed the product as UN2902, Pesticides, Liquid, Toxic, NOS (Contains 3-propyni butyl carbamate), 6.1 PGIII, Marine Pollutant. I advised the Captain on the commodity and the health hazards of the chemical. I also phoned the manufacturer, International Specialty Products (ISP), and spoke with John Shevlin who took my information and filed case #1-13827701 for his company records. He provided additional infonnation which I shared with the Captain. I asked for a better copy of the MSDS and noted that the commodity on the new MSDS had been reclassified to 1JN3082, Environmentally Hazardous Substance, Liquid NOS with the same technical name and showing the product as a class 9 arid a marine pollutant. I phoned the Captain and provided the revised information. The precautions on the MSDS remained the same.   Out of concern for the crew, the vessel returned to San Juan where the US Coast Guard, Environmental Quality Board, Emergency Medical Personnel and a Hazmat Clean Up Contractor were scheduled to work with the vessel when it arrived. When the ship arrived, the contaminate crew were decontaminated and sent to the hospital for X-Rays and observation. The",1.  THE PACKAGES SHOULD HAVE BEEN INSPECTED PRIOR TO LOADING.

While trailer was stationed at the Werner Enterprises drop yard in Nashville, Tennessee, a leak was discovered.  Hepaco, Inc. of Nashville, Tennessee was dispatched to assess the site.  Upon inspection, it was determined that the freight had loose caps, which resulted in the release of approximately 50 gallons of chromic acid solution.  The free product released inside the trailer, and traveled onto the asphalt surface, and soil adjacent to the lot.  Hepaco, Inc. applied absorbent pads, and absorbent boom to the free liquid.  Hepaco, Inc. also offloaded the trailer and repackaged the insecure freight.  Four (4) 55-gallon drums were damaged, and placed into 95-gallon overpack drums as well.  Hepaco, Inc. returned to the site to excavate the impacted soil, and pressure washed the affected lot, to prevent residual contamination.  The site was restored to preexisting condition.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Apparently, the release occurred as a result of loose caps on the freight inside the trailer.

While outside the truck, he noticed a solvent odor.  During an inspection of the trailer, he discovered a leaking container.  At this time he donned the appropriate PPE for remediation.      He then entered the trailer and identified material leaking from a quick-disconnect valve on the lid of the tote.  The driver pressed the quick-disconnect valve to try and relieve any pressure from the tote.  The tote did release some pressure and when quick-disconnect valve was released, it seemed to re-seat it self properly.      The driver then cleaned up the spill, which included cleaning the trailer and tote, and digging up some gravel beneath the trailer.  The driver estimated that 1-3 gallons of solvent leaked.     All generated spill cleanup material was packaged into an appropriate DOT specification container, which was labeled and marked as required.  Also a new shipping document was generated for the new container.      The driver pulled over about every 30 minutes to look at the tote for any further spillage.  It arrived at the destination facility without any further incident.      It is believed that the quick-disconnect valve was not seated properly. Pressure build-up in the tote because of elevation change may have also been a contribution factor.","After an incident investigation was performed, new procedures will be used for the quick-disconnect valves.

Spill technicians Samuel Harner and Andrew Fries donned proper personal protective equipment and responded.  The Hotline contacted Network Control Group and Aircraft Maintenance and advised of spill. Upon arrival of the spill scene, the technicians confirmed a mercury spill.  The DHL network control group was contacted to advise confirmed mercury spill. The PNFMS (electronic pilot notification form system) was referenced and it was determined that inbound Flight 412, Tail N7O2AX, ONT to ILN contained a reportable quantity of mercury. Shipment was Awb# SOP 2932564854 ORD located in container #ONTO1. This was a 2 piece shipment containing a combined weight of 36.2 kg of mercury. This shipment was also referenced in the PNFMS for outbound Flight 797, Tail N767AX, ILN to ORD with the location of load position 3A1.  Hazmat Hotline contacted John Keane, Ramp Manager at ORD and informed him of the possible leaking mercury shipment. The Hotline contacted HMHTTC Spill Response and reported the aircraft incident at ORD, requesting response. hMHTTC advised of an ETA 2 to 3 hours.  ILN management conducted an area check of the Chicago load area in the haz sort and mercury was found. The NRC (National Response Center) was contacted to report the leaking mercury. Report # 796154 was assigned to ILN and Report # 796156 was reported to the aircraft at ORD.  Hazmat response crews worked on spill mitigation at aircraft N7O2AX (aircraft located at ILN), aircraft N767AX (aircraft located at ORD), and building 207/208/209 (hazmat sort building). Response crews were also dispatched to the SOP station (origin station) and the ONT/ONR (ramp) station to conduct a check for possible mercury contamination. No mercury was found at SOP. Mercury was found at ONT/ONR ramp. Hazmat response crew mitigated mercury contamination at ONT/ONR.  Upon arrival at the ORD ramp, response crews began clean up.

When our driver arrived at the shipper's location, Sasol North America personnel opened the dome lid and inspected the cleanliness of the trailer that the product was to be loaded.  The person who performed this task failed to secure the dome lid after the inspection.  After the trailer was inspected, the product was loaded onto the trailer.  Plant rules forbid our drivers from climbing ontop of trailers to ensure all openings are secured.  As our driver was exiting the plant and onto the roadway he noticed that product was leaking from the run-off tube which is connected to the crash box surrounding the dome lid.  The driver then climbed on top of the trailer and saw that the dome lid was open and not secured.  The driver noticed that there was approximately 1/2 gallons of product in the crashbox area and a small amount has spilled onto the roadway.  The driver then closed and secured the dome lid.  The driver then walked back to the plant and notified the shipper.  Shipper personnel removed and disposed of the product from the crashbox and the road.  Trailer was then taken back into the plant and the exterior was cleaned and de-ordorized.",Shipper has procedures in-place to ensure that all trailer openings are secured before and after loading of their products.

During his post trip inspection he noticed a very small leak approximately 12 drops per minute. A spill pad was put under the leak location. The product was transferred into another trailer.  The trailer that had the failure was brought to a shop for inspection and repair. It was found that the shear section of the internal valve had a small crack in it which was allowing the product to leak. The shop replaced the failed piece of equipment.,The annual inspection of the trailer includes pressure testing to identify this type of problem.

Yhere was approximately 1 cup of product that had leaked onto the concrete containment area. The driver put a bucket underneath the leak to contain it and it was determined that the best option would be to unload the product into the cusstomer tank.   The trailer was tagged as a leaking unit and sent to the shop for inspection and repair after being cleaned. The trailer inspection found a small crack in the barrel of the trailer that appears to have been corrosion related. The crack was repaired and the trailer tested and found to be in good working order.,This particular trailer was repaired to prevent future leaks. The leak in the barrel appears to be the result of corrosion.

While traveling, the TruGreen ChemLawn vehicle was involved in an accident, which damaged the tank truck, and resulted in the release of approximately 170 gallons of liquid fertilizer, and approximately 5 gallons of diesel fuel.  The liquid fertilizer is a mixture of Barricade 4 FL Herbicide, and Riverdale Triplet Low Odor Premium Selective Herbicide, which is diluted with approximately 95-98% water.  TruGreen ChemLawn utilizes the liquid fertilizer for purposes of lawn application and treatment.  The Woodbridge Police Department, Woodbridge Fire Department, and County Hazmat Team responded to assess the site.  The County Hazmat Team applied absorbent material to contain the free liquid on the affected asphalt surface.  The free liquid also affected a nearby storm drain, and ran into the surface soil along the edge of the roadway.  Allstate Power-Vac, Inc. of Linden, New Jersey was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Allstate Power-Vac, Inc. recovered the spent absorbent material from the asphalt surface, and applied additional absorbent pads and absorbent boom to the remaining free liquid.  Allstate Power-Vac, Inc. proceeded to flush the impacted storm drain, and used a shovel to remove the affected surface soil along the edge of the roadway.  The spent absorbent material, absorbent pads, soil, and absorbent boom were containerized into recovery drums, to be held for disposal per local, state, and federal regulations.

Upon exiting the Kemiron, Inc. facility in Fontana, California, a leak was discovered coming from the Pan Western vehicle.  Apparently, the manway cover had been left open on the Pan Western vehicle, which resulted in the release of approximately 25 gallons of ferric chloride solution.  The free product was released to the asphalt surface within the parking lot, and along the roadway at entrance to the facility.  Kemiron, Inc. personnel applied absorbent material to contain the free liquid.  The San Bernardino County Fire Department responded to assess the site.  Ecology Control Industries of Montclair, California was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, Ecology Control Industries neutralized the product within the parking lot, and along the affected roadway, per instruction from San Bernardino County Fire Department.  Ecology Control Industries also recovered a minimal amount of soil at the edge of the roadway, which had been affected.  Ecology Control Industries proceeded to pressure wash the affected area to prevent residual contamination.  One 5-gallon drum of contaminated soil was generated during the cleanup.

Our driver states that as he crested a hill  another vehicle was hugging the center line.  Our driver veered to the right and dropped down into the ditch as this road has no shoulder.

Before the bobtail was able to stop a driveway came upon its path.  The bobtail was already leaning to the right and as the driver drove over the driveway it righted itself then dropped off hard on the other side of the driveway so much so that our driver could not correct the bobtail and the bobtail rolled over.",Our drivers are taught that if they drop off the road they are to stay off until they can stop or slow down the bobtail enough to safely ease back onto the roadway.,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC331,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,41384,Ferrellgas,US,

One (1) 55-gallon drum of concrete cleaning acid (Muriatic acid), was being utilized at the RSC Equipment Rental facility.  Approximately 25 gallons of product remained within the drum.  Apparently, while attempting to neutralize the remaining product within the one (1) 55-gallon drum, and flush the residual through the waste water treatment system at the RSC Equipment Rental facility, an overflow occurred.  The product released to the asphalt surface beneath the drum, and traveled into the waste water treatment system.  U.S. Environmental Services of North Little Rock, Arkansas was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival, U.S. Environmental Services neutralized the free product on the affected asphalt, and the remaining product within the drum.  U.S. Environmental Services also washed the affected asphalt to prevent residual contamination.  The neutralized product and water were placed into the waste water treatment system, to be handled in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.

The driver of the CMV, in an attempt to avoid contact, took an evasive action which resulted in the CMV rolling onto its left (DRIVER) side, sliding, and coming to rest across three westbound traffic lanes at a point just west of the interchangel 1A exit ramp.  The CMV consisted of a model year 2002 International 9400i series tractor (#1413) and a model year 1982 Process Engineering, DOT specification MC 338 double walled vacuum insulated cargo tank motor vehicle (#80). The steel outer jacket of the cargo tank motor vehicle was abraded while sliding along the pavement surface, resulting in several fissures in the jacket, a loss of vacuum and a diminution of insulation properties. This caused a slow buildup of pressure in the cargo tank. The primary cargo tank did not fail.  At the time of the incident the trailer was carrying approximately 10,000 gallons of Methane-Refrigerated Liquid at a pressure of 8 psig. The cargo tank Over The Road (“OTR”) valve was in the open position. This valve leads to a pressure regulator with a set to discharge pressure of 19 psig. Normally, the OTR valve and regulator system are connected to the vapor space of the cargo tank. However, when the cargo tank rolled onto its side, the piping system containing the OTR valve and regulator filled with liquid. Because of the loss of vacuum and diminished insulation, the pressure in the cargo tank gradually increased until the set to discharge pressure of the OTR system (19 psig) was reached, causing the regulator to operate and allowing a small stream of Methane Refrigerated Liquid to escape from the vent stack.  At approximately 1000 hours, the Transgas emergency response team arrived and closed the OTR valve system and stopped the flow. Product loss from the OTR is estimated to be less than 10 gallons of liquid which immediately vaporized into the atmosphere.  A second Transgas MC 338 cargo tank motor vehicle was brought to the scene to unload the rolled over tanker. After approximately half of the product was unloaded, the rolled over tanker was righted.

CSX Management contacted SWS First Response to respond and secure the container. Once on site, SWS representatives found the manway gasket misaligned resulting in the release of product / vapors. SWS repositioned the gasket and secured the manway bolts / nuts with a wrench. The response crew then pressure tested the container to ensure proper securement. After completing the test, the car was released to destination. We estimate less than one half gallon of product / vapors was released from the tank car.

Hepaco representatives threaded the bottom outlet auxiliary cap back into position and used a wrench to secure the secondary closure. The car was then switched into the local CSX Transflo Facility (final destination) for off loading. The shipper, Celanese LTD was contacted and will make arrangements to have the car shopped and the valve(s) inspected after off loading.

He immediatley called for a response crew to clean the spill.  Upon arrival to the site, the er team opened the trailer and found paint leaking from one cracked drum.  The paint had flowed the length of the trailer floor, saturating the pallets of material.  The er team applied granular sorbents to the puddle of paint on the asphalt parking lot.  This material was swept up and containerized into a 55-gallon drum.    The er team then called the Oregan State Patrol to ask for permission to move the trailer to a dock facility for cleaning.  With that authorization, the trailer was moved to a dock facility close by.  The damaged drum was removed from the trailer and placed into an 85-gallon salvage drum.  The remaining drums were removed, cleaned and repalletized for shipment.  Granular sorbents were applied to the trailer floor and the waste material was swept into two 55-gallon drums for disposal.  With the trailer cleaned, the re-palletized material was placed on the truck for continued shipment to it's final destination.  The 85 gallon salvage drum was also put back in the trailer for delivery.    From the inital spill call until all of the drums were cleaned and re-placed on the trailer, approximately 10 hours elapsed.","Communication will be made with this shipper to ensure proper blocking and bracing of all drums.

THE DRUMS WERE SHRINK WRAPPED, BUT NOT TO THE PALLET, ALSO NO LOAD BARS OR STRAPS WERE USED BY OUR DRIVER OR THE SHIPPER.  OUR DRIVER LEFT AND WENT TO HIS NEXT PICKUP WHICH WAS ONE PALLET, THEN HEADED BACK TO THE TERMINAL YARD. HE BACKED INTO THE DOCK DOOR, OUR DOCK EMPLOYEE OPENED THE ROLL-UP DOOR OF THE TRAILER & SAW FOUR DRUMS LAYING ON THEIR SIDES.  HE NOTICED.

THE DENVER FIRE DEPT WAS CALLED & OUR BUILDING WAS EVACUATED, THE CLEAN-UP TOOK 3 1/2 HOURS.","All of our drivers are trained on the proper procedures of handling Hazardous Materials when they are hired/leased on with our company & every year while they are employed/leased on with us.  This employee has been with our company for 13 years, has handled numerous loads of hazardous materials without incident that is why I was concerned as to how this happened. When the clean-up was completed and we were allowed back into the terminal I sat down with our driver and had him describe the pick-up and the return to the yard.  When he arrived at the shipper the load consisted of 13 pallets with four 55 gallons drums strapped to each pallet for a total of 52. He knew that there would be at least one more pick-up that he would have to make and not knowing how much room he would need he asked the shipper’s receiver if the pallets could be double stacked (I explained to him that there were two mistakes he had made at this point (1) he should have called dispatch and asked about the next pick-up and the amount lie would have been getting (2) also asked about double stacking liquid drums), the man loading the freight went into their office and asked about stacking and apparently was told yes they could be double stacked.  The pallets were not in the best of condition, some of the boards were cracked and the loader was having a hard time stacking them without leaning, after rearranging he was able to keep them relatively square. Our driver signed for the load and went to his next pick-up, upon arriving at the second stop he opened the door to load his freight and everyone of the pallets from the first stop were still stacked without having moved. At this stop the pick-up was 1 pallet, he signed for the load, closed the door and headed back to the terminal.  I explained the reasons why this load should not have been accepted, (1) liquid material is in constant motion and should never be in any position other than the floor of our trailer, (2) all Hazardous Materials will be secured so there is no movement and that other material loaded around the HM will not fall onto the HM, (3) with this particular load being put on pallets there should have been several precautions taken (a) the pallets should not have had broken/missing boards, (b) there should have been a slip sheet (cardboard) on top of the pallet before the drums were set on top, (c) the drums besides having straps should have been shrink wrapped to the pallets not just to each other this would have prevented any movement of the drums off of the pallets.  My commitment to the company and our drivers is to help them understand why load securement and the proper handling of Hazardous Materials is so vital to them, the company and the industry. Training is and will be ongoing for this and all drivers within our company to ensure theirs and the motoring publics safety.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,"Fiber drum, cont1 for solids, cont2 for liquids",DRUM FBR,No,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,0,0,16,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,11809,BULLOCKS EXPRESS TRANS.

As a result, a container of A-1 Industrial Cleaner was ruptured and released onto the trailer's aluminum floor.      At approximately 5:19 pm CST, KLLM Transport Services retained Cura Emergency Services (CES) to manage the environmental clean up operations.  Based on the information provided, a crew was dispatched from TAS Environmental Services to perform the corrective actions.    The crew from TAS arrived on-site and assessed the scope of the release.  The container that released the material was near the nose of the trailer.  The crew began corrective actions by locating the damages container.  Once found the container was cut free of the shrink wrap and plugged the puncture hole.  The hole was caused by a buckling of the container under the pressure the pallet that had been stacked on top.  Once the container was removed from the trailer it was placed into an overpack drum to be salvaged by the manufacturer.  The crew stabalized the trailer for travel by securing the load.  Due to the driver being close to the shipper, the trailer was to be returned for reloading and cleaning by the shipper.",No additional comments.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8500,KLLM Transport,US,

He immediately called for a spill response crew.  Upon arrival to the site, the ER team opened the trailer to find multiple drums overturned on their side.  The paint material was leaking through the bungs in the lids and the lids themselves.  Still some other drums appeared to be leaking due to the altitude difference from sea level to the higher altitude of Colorado.      The ER team had a forklift delivered to the site to facilitate off loading of the drums and pallets.  The ER team spread out a large sheet of visqueen and began unloading each pallet on the visqueen.  The leaking drums were inspected for damage and then cleaned of the paint material on the outside of the drum.  No drums were found to be damaged.  Each cleaned drum was re-palletized and prepared for continued shipment.  Granular absorbent was applied to the floor of the truck to absorb the paint.  The waste material was then swept up and put into drums for disposal  The truck was then reloaded and allowed to leave.    The ER team returned the following day to pressure wash the asphalt area stained by the paint.   The water was captured and drummed for disposal.","A suggestion will be made to the shipper to utilize closed top 55-gallon drums to ship this material.  That will alleviate the problem of leaks through the rings if the drums should fall.  In addition, filling the drums slightly less will help with deliveries to elevated altitude locations.  If the material expands there will be room within the drum.    Also, proper blocking and bracing of loads will be reviewed with the shipper and with the carrier staff.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,74,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,11000,American Compliance Technologies,US,

When the driver arrived at the yard in Buffalo, NY for unloading, it was discovered that the straps were secured too tightly and crushed the outer packaging (box) and damaged the inner packaging (plastic bottle).  The resulting release of product from the bottle started a reaction of the Hydrogen Peroxide with the fiberboard box.  This is in turn created a fire within the body of the trailer.      Water was used by employees to mitigate the fire and the Buffalo Fire Dept. was called in as a precaution.

It was a matter of time before the flange gasket was going to fail.  After hauling 4 previous loads, flange connection had loosened to the point of gasket failure before hydraulic by-pass could activate when PTO was engaged.  2.  Hydraulic Control Lever was not in the neutral position when the PTO was engaged to unload.    Tighteness of flange bolts were not checked by Terminal Shop after trailer left Contract Repair shop. Discussed quality control process of Contract Shop with the owner.  Owner concerned waived repair costs and offered to pay for any cleanup.    Driver was attempting to unload.  When he pulled up to the unload box and set his parking brakes, he engaged the PTO from inside the cab.  Apparently the hydraulic control valve was in the unload position and as soon as the PTO was engaged the pump pressed up the header piping on the trailer and blew out a 4"" flange gasket between the crude pump 4"" header ""T"".",All repairs done in any outside shop will be inspected by our company shop mechanics before the unit is allowed to return to work.

This resulted in the right rear tires of the trailer to go up and over the curb and lift off the ground. The weight of the freight started to shift causing the van trailer to roll over, pulling the tractor over. As tractor/van trailer landed on it's left side, the totes carrying the nickel powder landed on their sides and a small amount on materialspilled out in front of each tote inside the van trailer. Only one of the totes broke through the roof of the van trailer and spilled  a small amount of nickel powder on to the ground. The DEP estimated about 5-10 pound of material was released onto the ground. The tractor/van trailer landed on the grass area to the left of the entrance ramp. Weather conditions were wet. State police were on the site as driver was calling 911. Driver exited the vehicle by himself.  Towing company, fire department, and DEP were called on site. When the spilled  material was discover, a remediation company was called into excavate the material and cover the area with plastic to minimize the migration due to the wet conditions.","Review of proper loading procedures and review of proper securing of loads procedures, to prevent loads shifting during transport.

ENGINEER, SHIPPING AND TRANSFER",PO BOX 7444,LONGVIEW,TX,75603,Carrier,"On Tuesday, May 23, 2006, Groendyke Trailer 4247 was being trans-loaded from Martin Trailer 7797 when liquid was sprayed out the vent of the Groendyke trailer.  The trans-loading operation was a result of a customer return involving 2 compartments of acetic acid and one compartment of acetic anhydnde/acetic acid blend. Compartment #1 & #2 contained acetic add, and the customer reported Compartment #1 had trash in the boom outlet valve when they started to unload. The customer further reported leaping bottom outlet valves on compartments #2 and #3.  The acetic acid in càmpartments #1 and #2 passed product specifications, and both compartments were unloaded into 63TK-204 without incident. Compartment #3 could lot be unloaded to a product tank since it was a blend of products manufactured in Kingsport. Because the complaint was a leaking bottom outlet valve, the plan was to repackage the product and send back to customer. Even though there was no indication of a leak on the bottom outlet valve, sending the trailer back to the original customer without any changes would not have been well received. In all likelihood, the reported leak was a mis-operation of the hydraulic pump used to open bottom outlet valves at the customer location.","Corrective Action  1. Establish policy with Kingsport Logistics to not authorize return orders to Texas for material that can not be recycled to a process unit.  2. Review with customer proper operation of bottom outlet valve on multi-compartment trailers.  3. Modify/write procedure to use a pump when making transfer between similar sized containers, such as truck to truck.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,EASTMAN CHEMICAL COMPANY,US,

The driver requested 4500 gallons.  Loading of the truck commenced at 1120 at a rate of 53 gpm.  The operator began monitoring the gallon counter.  When the gallon counter reached 3800 gallons, the Operator visually checked the level in the tanker (12""-18"") remaining.  At 12:40, while monitoring the gallon counter, the Operator heard the truck ""running over"".  He immediately hit the ""Stop button"" and shut the valves.  The gallon counter was reading 4000-4100 gallons at the time the truck overflowed.    There was no problem with the tanker and a subsequent investigation indicated that the cause of the release was a malfunctioning gallon counter.  The release occured over a concrete area and was completely contained there.

Fire department inspected the area and all was clear. Washout cap was placed on the trailer and the driver comleted the delivery without further incidents.  Company investigation revealed that the driver failed to ensure the washout caps were in place before leaving the tank wash facility and prior to leaving the shipper's location.","Company has strict polices in place to ensure drivers check to ensure that all trailer openings are secured when a driver picks up a trailer and directly after the trailer is loaded.  Driver was counseled on the severity of his lack of attention to detail and future spill prevention training is scheduled for all drivers from the St. Gabriel terminal.

THERE WAS AN INCIDENT INVOLVING A SULFURIC ACID SPILL AT THE NORTH WEST ACID UNLOADING DOCK.  THE DRIVER WAS HOOKED UP AND TRYING TO UNLOAD HIS TRUCK, BUT THE DOWNSTREAM AUTOMATIC VALVE WAS CLOSED.  AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THE SAFETY DEPARTMENT FOUND THAT PRIOR TO THE DRIVER ARRIVING AT THE UNLOADING DOCK, THE EYE WASH STATION HAD BEEN TURNED ON, WHICH CAUSED AN INTER-LOCK TO CLOSE THE AUTOMATIC VALVE.  THIS CAUSED THE LINE TO BE PRESSURIZED AND WHEN THE DRIVER TRIED TO UNHOOK FROM THE LINE, THE PRESSURE IN THE LINE CAUSED THE ACID TO SPRAY OUT.  THE DRIVER HAD THE PROPER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT ON, BUT WHILE TAKING OFF HIS ACID SUIT, SOME OF THE SULFURIC ACID GOT ON HIS RIGHT ARM.  THE DRIVER WAS RINSED AND TRANSPORTED TO THE MORENCI CLINIC FOR PRECAUTION.  EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND RESCUE TEAM WERE ON THE SCENE WITHIN 15 MINUTES OF THE CALL.  WHEN SAFETY ARRIVED THEY PLACED THE DRIVERS ARM INTO THE ICE CHEST FULL OF WATER TO SUBMERGE HIS ARM.  SAFETY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ERRT SECURED THE SCENE.  SAFETY DID A FULL INVESTIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANED UP THE SULFURIC ACID.",A CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE TO ALL EYE WASH STATIONS AT THE ACID UNLOADING DOCKS TO ENSURE EVERYONE'S SAFETY.

While unloading the container, cargo agents Richard Morris and Harold Niebles came across AWB 125-24277223 , 1 piece at 42 kgs originating from Lagos, emitting a stong odor of gasoline. The agents removed the the box and placed on a skid so it could be further checked.Both agents advised Supervisor Paul Neal who then advised duty manager Tom Steffen, myself . I then went to investigate the carton and when I was within 4 feet of the carton the odor of gasoline was extremely noticeable. The carton on the outside was damp and visibly stained from some type of liquid. Inside the container was a piece of cardboard on the floor where the box was sitting , that too had some sort of liquid stain with a smell of gasoline.   FAA Agent Noel Franz notified who then conducted his own investigation and the liquid was determined to be Jet Fuel that was leaking from a Fuel Control Unit from an Aircraft.

I. Dupont  Deepwater N.J.  Robyn Younger  5-8-2006     On May 5, 2006 at approximately 6:30 AM, a scheduled delivery of Anhydrous Ammonia was made to the E.I. Dupont facility in Deepwater N.J via Airgas tractor T-27 and trailer N-27. Before the start of the unloading process an ammonia leak was detected at the flange where the feed tube enters the unloading pump on the trailer. I was notified by our driver (Keith McFarland), of the situation and that the unloading process would not continue pending further investigation by Dupont engineer Robert Oldach. After a discussion between McFarland, Oldach and myself, it was determined that the leak was small and mechanical conditions were sound. It was determined that the transfer into the storage tank would proceed. The transfer took place without incident. After the transfer was completed, Dupont operators drew a vacuum on the pump and associated piping causing the remaining ammonia residue to be evacuated. This action allowed the driver to return to the Airgas facility in Palmerton, Pa. without traveling public roads with a leaking trailer. Upon arrival in Palmerton the area of the suspected leak was disassembled. The cause of the leak was found to be a rubber O-ring at the mating flange of the pump and feed tube. Repairs were made by polishing the mating surfaces of the flange and pump and  a new O-ring. The vessel, pump and associated piping were pressure tested and no remaining leaks were found.

The batteries at the time of shipping and during transport were properly packaged on shrink wrapped skids and braced with wooden 2x4 from the factory.  Mr. Hoskins was traveling approximately 60 mph on the northbound side of Interstate 77 at mile marker 74 when the rear tandems separated from the trailer.  The separation of the rear tandems caused both the tractor and trailer to roll over on the right side.    The trailer was Great Dane trailer that had been manufactured in 1998.  After the accident it was discovered that Great Dane had a recall in 1999 for trailers that were manufactured in 1998 for the problem that caused the above described accident.  The recall was stated as follows: ""Certain commercial van trailers with slide suspensions could have improper welds attaching the upper bogie rails to the trailer crossmembers.  Loose upper bogie rails can result in the rollover of the trailer or a vehicle crash.""  We are not the original owners of this trailer therefore we had no knowledge of this recall until after the accident.  It has been determined that this trailer was not ever brought in during the recall for compliance.  It has also been determined by a Forensic Investigator for one of the Insurance companies that the cause of this accident was indeed improper welding of the rear tandems.    The West Virginia State Police were notified immediately.  The State Police, Handley Fire Department, JanCare Ambulance, Hutch's Body Shop, and HazMat teams responded immediately to the accident.  The HazMat teams used various methods of containing the acid, fuel, and debris from spreading further from the accident site.  A spill truck was brought in, spill pads, oil dry and soda were used in the clean-up of the accident scene.  A wrecker and roll-back truck towed the tractor and trailer away from the site.    At this time the cost to Shoun Trucking for the clean up and damage to the area of the accident are not able to be determined because of the various agencies involved have not yet processed the costs.  At the time of this writing the debris is still being transported to the Michigan Disposal Waste Treatment Plant.  The only costs that we are aware of in their entirity are that of the loss of cargo and the physical damage to our vehicles.",When a recall takes place the factory should track the involved vehicles until that particular vehicle has complied with the recall.,Yes,BATTERY,battery for holding battery fluid,BATTERY,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,53230,"Shoun Trucking Company, Inc.",US,

Our employee was ejected from the cab and was injured due to the crash, not the propane release.  The release was at the vapor return line where the valve goes into the tank.  Once the pressure was down on the tank our servicemen took the broken piece of the fitting out of the tank and installed a ¾ inch nipple and shut off valve to stop the leak of product.

The first 80% of the delivery was unremarkable. The product flowed as expected with no leakage or spillage.  Without warning, at about 11:45 a.m. on Monday 05/08/06, the flexible hose transferring the acid was propelled from its place at the rear of the tank trailer along with the 4 bolt-flange to which it was connected. The driver was blocked from reaching the nearest (rear) internal valve shut-off lever, so he shouted a warning to those plant personnel in the general area, ran to the front fender, and closed the internal valve using the emergency shut-off lever mounted on the front fender. The time this took was slight, but approximately 30 gallons of Hydrochloric acid spilled onto the immediate area of the plant. Some flowed onto concrete, some went down an acid containment grate built for that purpose, and some went onto a dirt area.  To mitigate the effects of the release, bags of soda ash, already on site for use in case of a spill, were dispersed over the area wet with acid. This step was taken by Appalachian Well Services plant employees to neutralize the Hydrochloric acid at least partially. Appalachian Well Services Safety Director, Joe Machado, was able to use materials on hand to allow movement of the remaining approximately 1000 gallons from the cargo tank to the plant storage tank.  This author quickly notified Great West Casualty Company (GWCC) after learning of the spill event. They arranged for Rick Nehrig, Independent Adjuster, of J.F. Terry Associates to travel to the site and coordinate any needed clean up effort. He estimated 30 gallons of Hydrochloric acid spilled in front of the storage tanks. The contaminated area was in an “L” shape — with the dirt affected about 39’ long and up to 8’ wide, and 37’ of cement affected. Some acid traveled over a grate and down a drain to an area designed to contain acid in such a situation.  Mr. Nebrig’s home office worked with the Debbie Brzoska at the GWCC office, and agreed to hire HM}ITTC, operating out of Carlisle, PA, to complete the clean-up operation. When the skies became cloudy and dark, Mr. Nebrig contacted the Elderton, PA Fire Department for containment assistance/advice. They involved the area Hazmaz Coordinator, who recommended tarping the area. Safety Director, Joe Machado, coordinated accessing the tarps, and getting them in place. It did not rain.   At 9:15 p.m., HMIITTC’s crew and equipment arrived on scene and began clean up of the contaminated soil. A back hoe owned by Appalachian Well Services was used, without charge, to collect the contaminated dirt. The crew dug 1/2 to 1 inch at some hot spots to collect a total of 4 barrels of contamination. Then they tested the remaining soil. Results were all within the 6 to 7 pH range, reportedly consider","The failed CPVC Schedule 80 nipple was saved and returned to the terminal along with the rest of the piping. The First Class Transport (FCT) Maintenance Supervisor, an experienced Tank Mechanic under contract to FCT, the FCT driver who made the delivery and the FCT Safety Director, looked over the parts closely. It appeared that the CPVC Schedule 80 material split cleanly across its width, as though it had been cut by an axe. The driver was standing in the immediate area of the piping, and saw no leaking prior to the hose and flange shooting off Given that this trailer has only been in service since 3/31/06, we spent considerable time considering possible physical insults to the piece which may have weakened it. We could not identify that anything had been dropped on or near that area. We could not identify anybody who tripped over the hose or any other “shock” to the hose. All our drivers have known for several months (since we first began using FRP Trailers) that the hoses must be disconnected at the 4- bolt flange before travel to prevent damage to the CPVC Schedule 80 plumbing from road vibration. We could find no evidence that this rule had been broken. The delivery was made under air pressure supplied by the tractor, but only a maximum of about 18 p.s.i. was being used, much less than would be expected to burst the nipple.   Having found no evidence of a physical insult to weaken the CPVC Schedule 80 nipple, we were left with the hypothesis that the material, while recommended by an FRP tank manufacturer, may not be able to stand up to some real-life highway and plant conditions. Alternately, the piece may have been defective, but we have no strong evidence to support this. The nipple is considered to be the weakest piece in the piping system based on thickness comparisons with other parts. The Maintenance Supervisor and mechanic arrived at a way to use a 3 to 2 Teflon encapsulated cast iron flange, a much sturdier part, to eliminate the nipple from the plumbing. Extra parts have been ordered to replace the nipple from other FRP tank trailers with similar plumbing setups. The driver assigned to pull a sister tanker to FCT-1572 was given a fill! report of the incident by the FCT driver present at Appalachian Well Systems. This will allow him to take special precautions during deliveries (where he and others stand during delivery, very carefully checking the plumbing prior to unloading) to keep everybody safe until all materials are available to re-do the plumbing.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4213,FIRST CLASS SERVICES,US,

Switch Crew Y220-23 was making up a train for a local delivery when switchman S.D. Helms was sprayed with sulfuric acid from the top of GATX 6650. Mr. Helms received immediate care by neturalizing the affected area with water and there after transported to the hospital and treated for his exposure to the product. He was released from the hospital with no lost time (not FRA reportable). The car was isolated in track 002. Summit Environmental was contracted to inspect and clean GATX 6650. During inspection they discovered that the frangible rupture disc had ruptured. When removed for inspection, it was noted that the disc was stamped 100 lbs. A proper 165 lb.disc was installed. The car was then sprayed with a solution to neutralize the acid and afterwards released to destination for unloading. Chemtrec was notified (05222006044) and contact was made with the shipper. CSXT requested the shipper inspect all further cars before releasing for transportation. CSXT also inspected ten rail cars intransit on CSX at various locations for installation of the proper rupture disc. All cars inspected were equiped with a 165 lbs rupture disc.   NARRI: 2 (5+5+0) x (2+2) = 80   Cause code = 441 (Frangible disc ruptured)",Mr. Briski met with shipper Rep. Jeff Taylor and Betsy Myers to discuss unloading and loading procedures. The Zinifex standard operating procedures #5-9 were reviewed and the recent visit by Union Tank Car Company to train the loaders who pre trip the cars was discussed.

With the assistance of Car Foreman, Gary Frey and Hazardous Material Manager Ed Cook, a list of cars in that general area of the yard with a sulfur like or paper mill odor was compiled. After climbing numerous cars in the area with this odor characteristic they discovered tank car ACFX 79861 with a residue around the top manway cover. 5 of 8 manway securement bolts were found less than tool tight. The manway was properly secured and the spilled product was cleaned, therefore the odor dissipated. The Ohio EPA accepted our response and mitigation.

The car was hauling Phosphoric Acid, 65-80% Food grade material. CSX Transportation Haz-Mat dispatched Hepaco Environmental to respond to the incident. It was discovered that the leak was coming from an 8-bolt blind flange that was bolted to the bottom of the car. The blind flange was bolted to the area where a bottom outlet valve would be; 7 of 8 bolts were tool tight. One nut was tightened 1/2 a turn. The leak did not stop after tightening the last nut. An empty tank car was brought in to perform a transload of the material. After the transload was completed, the blind flange was removed. The blind flange gasket was defective causing the leak.

Upon hearing the alarm, Marsulex employees headed to the rail dock area and found that a SUN rail car, containing spent sulfuric acid, was leaking spent acid onto the ground. The rail dock employee, Paul Mansfield, was found standing in the rail dock’s safety shower. Accounts of the incident from interviewing the employee indicate that the employee was trying to stay ahead of his work. In doing so, he indicates that he failed to carry-out a critical step in the process.  The employee states that he had hooked-up the eduction pipe to the SUN car to vent it down for unloading. This car was the southern most car in the loading/unloading area. After hooking-up the car to be vented down, the employee went to the north car to continue his work. After completing his routine work on the north car, he returned to the south car. The employee picked up an impact wrench to remove the eduction cap from the car. Upon removing the cap the employee realized that he had missed a critical step in the venting process. Once acid began flowing out of the eduction pipe the cap could not be reinstalled until flow stopped. Prior to removing the eduction cap the employee is required to ensure the car is not under pressure. The employee failed to verify this critical step.   As stated by the employee, as he started to remove the eduction cap he felt pressure on the pipe. Knowing he could not re-tighten the cap, he jumped back from the area. Given the car was still under pressure as the employee jumped back, letting go of the impact wrench, the car’s contents began to forcefully escape.   All required PPE was being worn at the time of the incident, however, the employee was sprayed with spent acid on the right side of the face, neck, and on his right forearm. The face and neck area were sprayed as the employee turned his head away from the flow of material. His right forearm was contacted due to the force of the material spraying up and under his rubber coat sleeve.  The employee stood in the rail dock emergency shower for 7 minutes. Then transferred, under his own control, to the shower in the employee locker room. He remained in this shower for another 20 minutes.  It is estimated that 4,000 pounds of material was spilled during this incident which lasted 2 minutes. At approximately 9:30 the NRC, SERC, and LEPC were contacted regarding the spill event. Paul Wilson and Tim Daniels from the Coast Guard were on-site at 12:10 pm for less than a half hour. The car wash down and the safety shower water caused material to migrate onto the BP refinery property. BP was advised of the incident and that spilled material was flowing onto their property. Material flowed onto an asphalt paved area. Marsulex called EQ Industrial Services to mitigate the spill on-site. Onyx was utilized by BP to clean-up the spent acid that had made its way onto their property.

Driver immediately checked the passenger side of the tank wagon to see if the jumper ]ose was connected properly and then noticed gasoline flowing from underneath the tank wagon and down onto unloading area ground and subordinate to adjacent roadway. Driver then ran back to the controls to disengage the pump and close the safety valve. According to the driver, by this time the tank wagon engine had began to run out of control — presumably from the engine picking up the gasoline fumes from the escaping product. Driver states that at about the time he pulled the lever is when an explosion occurred; knocking him approximately twenty-five (25) feet away from truck, Driver theiru got up onto his feet to get away and went about another fifty (50) feet and fell down to the pavement. Driver states he then got back up and was moving farther away from the scene. Driver realized that the personnel of Dugan & Meyers had called 911 fo:r emergency response and our driver effected call to our dispatch office and notified company of the incident. Driver as subsequently removed from the scene to a nearby hospital and treated and released for minor injuries. Response to the scene involved the Covington, KY fire and police departments, Cincinnati, Oh fire department, Kenton County Emergency Management Agency, Kentucky EPA, Homeland Security and FBI representatives.

The driver arrived at the terminal facility at approximately 3:00 am and performed the appropriate inspection of the pre-loaded chlorine trailer. The chlorine trailer was pre-loaded on 5/24/2006 by Altivia Corporation. After completing the appropriate inspections the driver left the Altivia Corporation facility in Houston, TX en-route to Ulirich Water Treatment Plant in Austin, TX. The driver did not experience any problems while en-route until he was approximately 6 miles east of 1-35 in Austin, TX. The driver had approached an intersection that has a traffic control devices. The light was red; the driver came to a controlled stop at the traffic light. When the light turned green the driver proceeded through the intersection in a westerly direction. The driver cleared the intersection and was approaching the next intersection at Springdale, when the light turned green the driver was approximately traveling about 25-30 mph when he looked into his mirrors and noticed a yellowish green vapor coming from the top rear of the trailer. The driver immediately pulled his unit to the right hand shoulder of Highway 290 and positioned the unit completely off the travel portion of the highway and secured the vehicle. The driver immediately exited the cab of the tractor and called 911 to report the incident. After calling 911 the driver immediately notified CTL Distribution, Inc. along with Altivia Corporation to report the incident. Steven White from Altivia Corporation the shipper and owner of the trailer notified SRS a contracted Environmental Response Service. SRS had personnel at the Ullrich Water Treatment Plant in Austin, TX, as SRS was Dontracted by Altivia Corporation to unload the bulk chlorine trailer when it arrived at the plant facility.  Altivia Corporation hired Specialized Response Solution (SRS) to manage and coordinate the transfer of the chlorine and clean up. Altivia Corporation also hired the Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health to conduct air monitoring around the perimeter of the trailer. Altivia Corporation hired Steven Emerson, PHD of Emerson Technical Analysis to perform a root cause analysis of the incident.  It has been determined that the reason the pressure relief valve opened was due to contaminates inside the trailer (i.e. water). The trailer involved in this incident had just received the required inspection and a procedure to dry the inside of the trailer was required. A third party (Brite Clean) was hired by Altivia Corporation to perform the required dry procedures prior to Altivia Corporation loading the trailer. Brite Clean was in possession of the trailer prior to loading by Altivia Corporation.  After the initial release occurred the area around the unit was isolated and the highway was closed and the resident where given instruction for shelter in place. T",It would appear that drying procedures at the facility (Brite Clean) that Altivia Corporation hired failed to monitor moisture content. There are monitoring devices that monitor dew point and this should be part of the drying procedures to monitor the moisture to verify that the inside of the trailer is completely dry.  I have attached a letter sent by Steven White General Manager for Altivia Corporation to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
