TERRY INSPECTED THE TRAILER, THE RIGHT HAND TRAILER DOOR WAS OPEN,  HE NOTICED THAT THE LOAD LOCK WAS DOWN AND THE TUMBS WERE ON TOP OF THE LOAD LOCKS.  HE DID NOT NOTICE ANY WASTE MISSING.  TERRY CLOSED THE DOOR AND TIED A ROPE THROUGH THE HASP.  FOR THE RECORD, TERRY DID NOT STOP UNTIL HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CAR.  BFI CALLED OUR OFFICE ON FRIDAY AT APPROX. 11:30 AM TO ADVISE A TOTE OF MEDICAL WASTE WAS FOUND ON THE SIDE OF I-64 IN KY.  I MADE A REPORT TO THE DOT.  MATT ROBERSON OF THE DOT ASSIGNED THIS INCIDENT REPORT#477469.  I ALSO CONTACTED THE CDC. THEY ADVISED IT WAS NOT NECESSARY  TO REPORT UNLESS IT WAS A SPILL OR ASSISTANCE IN CLEAN UP WAS REQUIRED.  WHEN TERRY ARRIVED AT THE OFFICE, WE HAD A DISCUSSION AND REVIEWED AND QUESTIONED HOW THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED.  ALL DRIVERS ARE REQUIRED TO FILL OUT AND SIGN A CHECK LIST BEFORE PULLING ANY HAZMAT LOADS. AN AUTHORIZED PERSON FROM THE SHIPPER IS TO GO WITH THE DRIVER AND CHECK THE CARGO STRAPS AND/OR LOADS LOCKS, TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE SECURE.  ALL TRAILER DOORS ARE TO BE SEALED AND RECORDED ON THE SHIPPING PAPERS.  THE TRAILER DOORS ARE TO BE INSPECTED.  THE DRIVER SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT BOTH THE BOTTOM AND TOP LATCHES ARE SECURE.

THE VEHICLE WAS EN ROUTE FROM MERCY COMMUNITY HOSPITAL (140  HAMMOND STREET, PORT JERVIS, NY 12771) TO THE BFINY FACILITY (910 E. 138TH STREET, BRONX, NY 10454).  THE VEHICLE WAS TRANSPORTING REGULATED  MEDICAL WASTE IN THE FOLLOWING NON-BULK AND EXEMPT CONTAINERS:  WHITE MOP RINGER CO. - MWS30 REUSABLE PLASTIC CONTAINER - 30 GALLONS 4H2/35.6/S/99/USA/+AA2039.   WHITE MOP RINGER CO - MWS150, REUSABLE PLASTIC CONTAINER, 130 GALLONS DOT E 10826.  FIBER BOARD BOX 4.5 CF. DURING TRANSPORTATION, AND AANIMAL RAN ACROOS THE INTERSTATE.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID THE ANIMAL, THE BFI DRIVER REACTED TO MOVING TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD.  AT THIS POINT THE INTERSTATE CURVES TO THE LEFT.  THESE TWO FACTORS CAUSED THE TRAILER TO IMPACT THE GUARDRAIL ALON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE.  AFTER BOUNCING OVER THE RAIL, THE TRAILER CAME IN CONTACT WITH A TREE, WHERE IS RESTED AT ABOUT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE.   AT THIS ANGLE THREE (3) MWS30 REUSABLE PLASTIC CONTAINERS INVERTED WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE TRAILER. APPROXIMATELY 32 OUNCES OF SOME LIQUID WAS OBSERVED ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER.  THE TYPE OF SOURCE OF THE LIQUID IS UNKNOWN.  ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE LIQUID WAS CONTAINED WITHIN THE VEHICLE A SMALL PORTION OF THE APPROXIMATE 32 OUNCES LEAKED FROM THE TRAILER.  BFI HAS TESTED AND RECEIVED CERTIFICATION FOR THE MWS30 CONTAINERS AT THE PACKING GROUP II LEVEL.  UPON INVESTIGATION OF THE INNER PACKAGE USED IN THESE THREE CONTAINERS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BAG USED WAS ONE THAT WAS PROVED BY THE CUSTOMER.  THEREFORE, PACKAGING INFORMATION, SPECIFICALLY TO THIS BAG, IS UNKNOWN.  BFI DOES PROVIDE COMPLIANT BAGS TO ITS CUSTOMERS; HOWEVER, FOR CUSTOMERS THAT WISH TO USE THERE OWN BAGS, BFI NOTIFIES THEM OF THE PACKAGING SPECIFICATIONS THAT THEY MUST COMPLY, SPECIFICALLY THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE INNER PACKAGING.
