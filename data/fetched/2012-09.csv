The driver, however, was re-instructed to conduct a  thorough inspection of each container before acceptance and if any evidence of a reduction in structural integrity is found to take appropriate action to  either place the container into a suitable salvage drum or re containerize before transportation is initiated. In addition, the shipper was advised of the  incident and was requested to inspect all drums in current inventory for any containers with suspect integrity.The customer was also notified that they must use proper packaging procedures and drum types when packaging their hazardous waste.",No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

Facility personnel entered the van and placed the leaking container into a suitable salvage drum along with all clean-up debris from the van trailer. The container was secured and was sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility.","At the time the driver accepted the container for transportation, no evidence of leaking was observed. The driver, however, was re-instructed to conduct a  thorough inspection of each container before acceptance and if any evidence of a reduction in structural integrity is found to take appropriate action to either place the container into a suitable salvage drum or re containerize before transportation is initiated, he was also re-instructed to assure the proper package is being accepted for transportation of a given waste type. In addition, the shipper was advised of the incident and was requested to inspect all drums in current inventory for any containers with suspect integrity.

(TSUI) cargo tanker, loaded with Allied Universal Corporation Sodium Hypochlorite (Bleach) product, was enroute from The Family Pools Company in Fort Walton Beach, Florida to another customer location Ace Hardware in Panama City, Florida for product delivery.  While in enroute, an unknown driver operator notified the driver of the TSUI cargo tanker that “something was leaking out of the top of his cargo tanker”.  The TSUI driver safely stopped his tractor-cargo tanker, and visually verified a leak from self-closing vent (called a Girard pressure relief vent) on top of the cargo tanker.  It was unknown to the driver how long the self-closing vent was leaking, however the TSUI driver had been on the road for “x” minutes.  As the TSUI driver was placing emergency triangles out, a Panama City Beach police officer stopped, and after visually noting the leak, called the Panama City Beach fire department to the scene.    Panama City Beach fire department confirmed the leaking liquid was Sodium Hypochlorite.  It has been estimated approximately “xxx” gallons of Sodium Hypochlorite had been released from the cargo tanker, spilling onto the cargo tanker.  The fire department washed down the cargo tanker and road with water.  Once the washing was complete, and the fire department as well as TSUI driver determined the cargo tanker was no longer leaking as the self-closing vent had resealed the TSUI driver and cargo tanker were released from the scene to continue delivery of the product.  Upon TSUI and Allied Universal Corporation joint investigation, it was determined that the TSUI driver failed to follow proper procedure for preparing the cargo tanker for shipment after delivery by failing to ensure the pressure in the cargo tanker was less than 22 psi.  His failure to properly follow procedure allowed the cargo tanker pressure to build while in transit, exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the pressure relief device, and leading to the release of Sodium Hypochlorite from the valve.","1) TSUI driver suspended during investigation  2) TSUI driver coached (special one-on-one training) on his mistake and how to    prevent this type of incident  3) Disciplinary action taken against the TSUI driver per company policy for his failure to follow company procedure  4) TSUI driver bonus for the quarter terminated do to driver being charged for the incident  5) All TSUI drivers at the Ellisville, Mississippi facility site underwent refresher training for proper cargo tanker delivery of Sodium Hypochlorite  6) TSUI Fleet Maintenance Manager is looking at additional devices to control the amount of pressure used to unload Sodium Hypochlorite cargo tankers so that pressure does not exceed the company policy of 22 psi.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Allied Universal Corp,US,

Upon arrival and closer inspection of tank car TILX 270325, the responders determined that the odor source from the vacuum relief valve (VRV) under the dome housing. The VRV had been stuck partially open due to some dried/hardened lading residue (Crude Oil) in the valve pathway. The VRV was removed, residue cleaned out of VRV, and replaced back into tank car. The tank car passed a field leak test with 10 psi.     *No injuries were reported.    File Note Item 19 - the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27 - Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:  The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

LOSH, CHMM, CSP",EHS MANAGER,333 Rouser Rd,Moon Township,PA,15108,Other-Terminal operator for TR,"On 9/6/2012, a Kinder Morgan employee at the Chattanooga TRANSFLO terminal was preparing to start a transfer of 70% hydrogen peroxide from railcar to trailer via a peroxide transfer pump. Trailers were moved within the terminal by a 3rd party motor carrier. In this event, the motor carrier (Trimac) dropped the empty trailer to be loaded beside the wrong railcar. The employee began to hook the loading hoses from the peroxide pump to the trailer. During a verification the terminal manager recognized that the dropped trailer had been dropped beside the wrong railcar. The terminal manager radioed for the in-house third party jockey driver to return to the trailer and move the trailer to the correct railcar position. The driver immediately came back and backed his truck into the dropped trailer and re-connected. The terminal manager observed this and then told the driver not to move the truck until all loading connections had been removed from the trailer. After a few minutes the motor carrier driver ignored that instruction and began to pull away. The loading hose was still connected to the transfer pump. The hose was ripped out of the pump and approximately 1 gallon of hydrogen peroxide (70%) was released onto the ground. The pump was not running so only a residual amount of hydrogen peroxide was in the pump. The release was immediately cleaned up and repairs had to be made to the loading hoses and there was some damage to the transfer pump.","DIRECT CAUSES:   1.Operating equipment without authority- The Trimac motor carrier driver was advised not to hook to the trailer until it was broken down.   2.Failure to communicate/coordinate  3.Failure to identify risks    ROOT CAUSES:   1.Misunderstood directions  2.Lack of situational awareness- Driver was not aware of the placement of the Loader on the trailer.   3.Inadequate development of standard- The use of a jack stand, or glad-hands, on a dropped trailer is required when loading commences but not called for during set up.      CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:   Training system evaluation and follow-up- The use of glad-hand locks will be required for all dropped trailers.  Procedures will be updated and affected personnel re-trained.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Kinder Morgan Terminals,US,

It was reported that a Dana Companies tanker truck was overturned resulting in a leak of product and motor oil. ERTS dispatched Marion Environmental to the site. Upon arrival, Marion personnel determined that the Aromatic 150 Fluid dripped into an onsite storm drain which did not lead to the onsite oil/water separator. Absorbents were applied to the impacted asphalt lot and the impacted storm drain. Contractor utilized an emergency unloading valve to trans load the Aromatic 150 Fluid material into a replacement tanker.

The car was isolated and the shipper DIDION Ethanol LLC was notified thru CHEMTREC # 2012-09-15-00090. SWS Environmental Services, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found that the bottom outlet cap was loose and the valve was in the closed and locked position. The response team tighten the cap and the leak stopped. The issue was identified and the problem was relayed to the shipper representative Mr. Jim Lenz, 606 770 5093 of DIDION Ethanol LLC. The shipper contacted the FRA and has requested an OTMA to get the car to destination and be off loaded. Once the car is empty the shipper will request another OTMA from the FRA to have the car be sent to a repair shop for final repairs.     This incident did require a special switch move.

Our driver performs our standard pre-trip inspection before departing (including verifying closures are in place), and no anomolies were noted.  At the Consignee, our driver prepared the trailer for unloading and applied air pressure to convey product to the Consignee's storage tank.  At this point, he noticed product vapor venting from the blanked-off loading flange.  He depressurized the trailer and inspected the loading flange closure.  He noticed that two of the four bolts appeared to be overtightened, causing the flange to be slightly mis-aligned.      Our driver removed, inspected and reinstalled the flange-blank, replacing the two defective bolts.  Product residue on the side of the trailer was water rinsed to the Consignee's containment area.  Our driver completed unloading without further incident.","This trailer is equipped with a secondary closure, which is a butterfly valve between the flange and the tank.  Inspection by our shop shows that the butterfly valve is fully operational, so it is presumed that the butterfly valve was not in the fully closed position during this incident.

A CSXT HazMat Sentinel responded and found the PRD in the BL Side box to be venting continuously, the valve piping frozen over with a heavy coating of ice. The piping was de-iced and the PRD reset. At 1350 hours the tank car was moved to destination under verbal FRA movement approval #20120929R1V for unloading.    This incident did require a special switching move.

AS THE AUSTIN VEHICLE STOPPED, ANOTHER COMMERCIAL MOTOR VEHICLE TOWING A TRAILER (OTHER VEHICLE), TRAVELING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, BUT BEHIND THE AUSTIN VEHICLE, COLLIDED INTO THE RIGHT REAR OF THE AUSTIN VEHICLE. THE AUSTIN DRIVER STATED THAT HE FELT THE COLLISION, AND MOVED THE AUSTIN VEHICLE FORWARD ACROSS THE RAILROAD TRACKS TO A SAFER POSITION ON THE RIGHT SHOULD WHERE HE PARKED IT. UPON EXISTING THE AUSTIN VEHICLE, HE IMMEDIATELY ASSESSED THE SCENE AND CALL 911, AND THEN CONTACTED AUSTIN FOR ASSISTANCE. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT, THE DRIVER OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WAS FATALITY INJURED. THE AUSTIN DRIVER WAS NOT INJURED. THERE WAS NO RELEASE OF ANY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. THERE WERE NO WITNESSES TO THIS ACCIDENT, OTHER THAN THE AUSTIN DRIVER. AUSTIN REPORTED THE ACCIDENT TO THE NRC. THE STATE POLICE CLOSED THE EASTBOUND SIDE OF US 90 FOR ABOUT 4 HOURS BECAUSE OF AMOUNT OF DEBRIS ON THE ROADWAY CAUSED BY THE WRECKAGE OF OTHER VEHICLE, AS WELL AS THE INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY THEM DUE TO THE FATALITY. AFTER RELEASING TRAFFIC FLOW ON EASTBOUND SIDE OF US 90, THE STATE POLICE ORDERED THE AUSTIN DRIVER TO MOVE AUSTIN VEHICLE TO A NEARBY REST STOP WHERE A HAZMAT TEAM OVERSAW THE TRANSFER OF ALL CARGO TO ANOTHER VEHICLE, OPERATED BY ANOTHER DRIVER, THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DRIVEN TO IT INTENDED DESTINATION, JUST A FEW MILES AWAY. AUSTIN SENT A THIRD-PARTY, INDEPENDENT CRASH SPECIALIST TO THE ACCIDENT, WHO ARRIVED LATER IN THE DAY. HE REVIEWED THE ACCIDENT SCENE, SPOKE WITH THE STATE POLICE, INTERVIEWED THE AUSTIN DRIVER, AND INSPECTED THE AUSTIN VEHICLE. THE STATE POLICE INDICATED THAT THE OTHER CARRIER'S DRIVER CAUSED THE ACCIDENT. THE AUSTIN CRASH SPECIALIST FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THE OTHEER DRIVER CAUSED THE ACCIDENT. AS SUCH, THIS ACCIDENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS ""NON-PREVENTABLE"" FOR AUSTIN BASED ON THE DEFINITION OF ""PREVENTABLE"" IN 49 CFR 385.3.","IN ACCORDANCE WITH 49 CFR 392.10, AND LOUISIANA 32:173.1, THE AUSTIN VEHICLE WAS REQUIRED TO STOP AT THIS PARTICULAR RAILROAD GRADE CROSSING.

The impact broke the rear suspension and allowed the driveshaft to drop from the transmission.  The truck then laid over in it's left side and slid down the highway.  Damage occurred to the rear deck of the delivery truck which caused product release.  Sparks from sliding down the road ignited the product.  Fire and rescue personnel responded to the scene.  Our company representative was dispatched immediately to the scene.  Water streams were applied to the truck by the fire department.  Hazmat personnel closed all of the valves at the rear of the truck stopping the product release.  Product release occurred for approximately 6 hours.  All product released was consumed in the resulting fire.,This incident was caused by another driver crossing the yellow line and striking our vehicle.

When the driver hooked up his tractor he noticed a small drip coming from the nose of the trailer onto his rear wheel fender.  He immediately notified the Facility Manager and, upon investigation, the leaking container was discovered and overpacked.  A pinhole-sized opening on the bottom of a 55-gallon steel, closed-top container was found to be the source of the leak.  Floor-dry and rags were used to clean up the small amount of liquid inside the trailer, the fender and asphalt parking lot.  This material was collected and placed inside an 85-gallon poly overpack along with the leaking 55-gallon metal drum.  Approximately twenty minutes elapsed between the discovery of the leak and the final clean-up of this container.  While overpacking this leaking container, Heritage personnel noticed a second container began leaking.  Since a second container began leaking, the trailer was pulled up to the dock of Heritage Environmental Services' Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility where all containers were unloaded.  During the process of unloading the trailer and overpacking the second leaking container, three additional containers began to leak.  Therefore, those containers were also overpacked along with three remaining containers of the same waste stream that were not leaking.  A total of eight containers were overpacked as a precautionary measure.  The resources required to complete these actions took approximately six hours utilizing four Heritage personnel.",Heritage contacted the offerer to discuss the use of alternative packaging for this waste stream in the future to prevent recurrence.,No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,HERITAGE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES,US,

DBUX 303243 was cordoned off awaiting a detailed inspection. A contract responder's inspection of DBUX 303243 determined the product was dripping from the valve stem of the closed bottom operated BOV. The responder could not access the valve stem for repairs/securement as a steel plate was welded over the valve stem access hole in the adjacent skid plate. DBUX 303243 was carefully moved to an isolated location in the railyard for product transfer. All lading within DBUX 303243 was transferred without further incident into another suitable tank car by 1945 hrs. CDT, 9/29/2012.  Afterwards, the product drip from DBUX 303243's BOV ceased.

Inspection by UPRR and local F.D. responders revealed entrained residue tank car TILX 600722 was the odor source. Further inspection resulted in the 375 psi Midland pressure relief valve (PRV) being identified as the escaping vapor source. Responders successfully applied a chlorine capping kit appliance over the failed PRV ending the vapor emissions into the atmosphere. TILX 600722 was set-out of the train and isolated at a nearby siding. The residue chlorine within TILX 600722 was transferred into trucks and chlorine vapors sparged through sodium hydroxide. The responders depressurized TILX 600722 and replaced the failed PRV in kind. OTMA FRA-12090842 was received to transport TILX 600722 to a qualified repair facility for leakproofness testing of the replacement PRV.,No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,,105J600W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,400002,BNSF Railway Company,US,

A passing tow truck driver noticed the wreck, called the police and fire department, who then notified Mid Thumb Trucking.  The driver was taken to a hospital for injuries and the fire department and tow truck vehicles secured the scene until we arrived.  There was no evidence of product leaking from the trailer. A special HAZMAT team was called in to drill the holes in the side of the trailer, and an environmental crew was called in to drain it.  The product that did leak began when a hole was drilled by the HAZMAT team, allowing air to vent into the trailer and release fuel out of a designed relief area called a void hole.  This hole was plugged within a minute or so and no more fuel was spilled.  The environmental crew on-site cleaned up that spill and was in charge of remediation of the scene when the truck/trailer was pulled from it.  The trailer was crushed on the passenger side due to the accident, but did not leak or have any signs of rupture when it was righted and towed away.","The main suggestion to prevent the spillage would be to plug or cork off all void holes or other possible avenues of fuel leakage prior to venting the trailer by drilling holes in it.  Upon inspection, some product (about 250 gallons) was found still in the trailer that could not be pumped out.  That product was drained using the trailer piping (which was also undamaged) and discarded as slop.",Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC306,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,176260,MD THUMB TRUCKING CO,US,

As a result, the cargo shifted releasing an undetermined amount of herbicide, paint, and ink inside the trailer.    Emergency Response:    On September 2, 2012, at approximately 11:26 AM CDT, Mr. Lee Copblentz with CRST  retained Cura Emergency Services (CES) to manage the cleanup operations within the trailer. The CES incident manager contacted Officer Jason Brandy with the Colorado State Patrol Hazmat Patrol to gain additional infonnation about the release. Based on available information, the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from Belfor Environmental to assess the site and perform the corrective actions.    Regulatory Notification:    The release was contained to the interior of the trailer. No sensitive receptors were impacted; therefore no state regulatory notification was necessary. Additionally, on September 2, 2012, at approximately 11:35 am CDT, onsite Colorado State Patrol Hazmat Patrol personnel, Mr. Jason Bandy, advised the CES incident manager no regulatozy notification would be necessary.    Corrective Actions:    Belfor personnel met with Mr. Bandy. Crews donned the proper PPE to make entry into the trailer. Belfor personnel collected and containerized all damaged or leaking herbicide containers into (3) three 55-gallon poly drums for transport and disposal. Damaged and leaking containers of ink and paint were collected and containerized into (14) fourteen 55-gallon drums for transport and disposal. Once all damaged  and leaking products were removed  from the trailer, crews deployed granular absorbents to the trailer's surfaces to solidify any free-standing product. All spent absorbents were collected and containerized into (1) one 55-gallon drum. Belfor personnel wiped all impacted surfaces of the trailer with absorbent pads until no visual or olfactory evidence of ink, paint or herbicide could be observed at the site. The trailer was then up righted and towed from the area. With the site returned to pre-spill conditions, Belfor personnel demobilized from the site.",EDUCATE DRIVERS ON THE BENEFIT OF THE SMITH SYSTEM RELATING TO MAKING TURNS.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,13832,"CRST INTERNATIONAL, INC.",US,

Arrival Inspection was conducted on 9/19/2012 by Terminal Manager. Only documented defect was a missing chain on the sample tube cap. No indications of any defects or releases. Two full truck loads and one partial were taken off railcar GATX 95781 on 9/19/2012; the day before the release. No issues observed during this transfer. There was no release of gas when the gate valve was opened.   The railcar was not being offloaded when the release was discovered on 9/20/2012. The loader was going to connect a vapor recover hose from an empty railcar into GATX 95781. He connected to the empty railcar and as he was going to connect the vapor recovery hose to GATX 95781, he discovered the leak. No issues noted until valve was opened. The terminal and CSX/TRANSFLO notified the local Fire Department  and Hillsborough County EMA.  Emergency response contractor was also deployed onsite to evaluate situation and car was then off-loaded without incident at 13:15.    Temperature was approximately 77 °F at time of release on 9/20/2012. Average temperature on 9/19/2012 was 82 °F.  RESCAR suspects temperature change may have been a factor, but unsure what caused seal to not set properly. Seal on gate valve of the liquid side not seated properly.  RESCAR was not able to repair the valve on-site. Further information on cause may be available when repairs can be made off-site at the railcar repair shop.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day in-transit facility pending final delivery to the destination facility. While at this  location, it was discovered that material had escaped from the package onto the ground. Facility personnel assembled a response team to enter the trailer and address the source of the leak. Upon inspection, it was discovered that one poly drum had developed a small crack on the bottom of the drum. The crew proceeded to overpack the leaking container, excavate and drum the soil along with all debris and clean-up supplies used to contain the release and decontaminate the trailer floor.  The trailer floor was repaired and placed back in to service. At the conclusion of the response activities, the material was sent to the intended waste management facility where it was accepted and processed without incident.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of damage or leaking was observed. Drivers will continue to inspect each container  before it is loaded and will take all appropriate actions should a container show evidence of reduced structural integrity. IN addition, the shipper has been  advised of the situation and have been asked to inspect all container used for the transport of waste materials to insure they meet all required  specifications.

Upon arrival at the customer's site, our driver was directed away from the loading dock to a parking area near the customer's storage area by the customer. The delivery truck was stopped in an area with a slight incline (~ 2-3 degrees) with the opening of the truck pointing downhill. Each tote was moved from it's secure point on the truck to the rear opening by the E&C driver with a manual pallet jack where the customer would unload each tote from the truck with a forklift. The first 3 totes were unloaded without incident. As the fourth tote was being moved to the rear opening, the momentum carried the package too close to the edge resulting in the tote tipping out of the truck and onto the parking area surface ~(4 - 4.5 feet). Upon impact, the tote ruptured (actually broke into 3 pieces). The duration of the release was immediate and all 330 gallons spilled onto the parking area. Since it was on their property, the customer took control of the spill management by diking and adding enough vermiculite to completely immobilized the spill. I understand they had an outside contractor (on they use all the time) complete the clean up which, I understand, was completed in about 4 hours. I notified our insurance carrier with a quick report (copy attached) as I was expecting a bill for clean up and disposal. Also, the customer indicated they would provide us a copy of their ""near miss"" report so we would have all the specific details.

BECAUSE THE TRAILER WAS NOT PRESSURIZED, THE TRAIL FROM THE LIQUID WAS INTERMITTENT. AN EMPLOYEE FROM THE KEMIRA MANUFACTURING FACILITY NOTICED THE TRAIL OF FERRIC CHLORIDE ON THE STREET JUST OUTSIDE THE FACILITY. HE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE DISPATCHER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOAD. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CONTACTED, AS WELL AT THE KEMIRA EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED FIRST, SPREADING ABSORBENT MATERIAL ONTO THE LIQUID RELEASED. THE KEMIRA EMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 13:45, AND BEGAN THE CLEANUP OF THE ABSORBENT MATERIAL. THE CLEANUP WAS COMPLETED BY 18:00 THAT DAY.","THE TRAILER INVOLVED IN THE SPILL HAS BEEN MOVED TO THE KEMIRA LOGISTICS, INC. MAINTENANCE FACILITY IN EUCLID, OH. THE RELEASE VALVE WHICH WAS LEFT OPEN IS BEING REPLACED WITH AN AIR ACTUATED VALVE WHICH AUTOMATICALLY CLOSES WHEN AIR HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE TRAILER.
