The truck with drip bucket attached to the bottom outlet valve was escorted by fire safety personnel from the loading rack to the pump off rack.  The product was pumped off the trailer to the shore tank without incident.  The truck then left the terminal for repair.  The avgas is driver loaded with no pre-loading inspections by terminal personnel.,There has been few instances of leaks associated with this loading system.

When the spill was found at the Carlisle, PA terminal, the dock person noticed Marine Pollutant stickers on the containers.

The transformers were approximately 55 to 85 gallons in size.  As this shipment of Transformers was being unloaded from one trailer to be placed in another trailer for delivery to the final destination, employees discovered that three of the transformers were leaking.  The leak appeared to be around some connections or attachments on the external shell of the three  transformers.  Oil absorbent was placed around the transformers and all along the floor of the trailer.  It was estimated that a total of one gallon had spilled into the van trailer.  The shipment was off-loaded onto plastic sheeting.  The liquid contents of the leaking transformers were transferred to metal drums to prevent any further spillage.  All the contents, new containers, and the transformers were then loaded onto a van trailer for shipment to the final destination.",Notification has been made to the transporter who first picked up the shipment of transformers about proper handling of this type of material.

While traveling on Interstate 71, Northbound at mile-marker 9.4 in Louisville, Kentucky free product was discovered leaking from the Inca, Inc. cargo tank.  The Louisville Fire Department, Kentucky Highway Department, Jefferson County Emergency Management Agency, Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet and the United States Department of Transportation responded to the scene.  The Kentucky Highway Department placed down sand to contain and absorb the free product.  All northbound lanes of Interstate 71 were shut down for approximately 3 hours.  Evergreen Environmental of Crestwood, Kentucky was contacted to perform the cleanup.  Evergreen Environmental placed additional absorbent materials and boom on the affected asphalt and a containment pool under the leaking cargo tank to contain the free product and prevent further migration.  Further investigation determined that approximately, one hundred and sixty-three gallons of free product was released.  Apparently, the release was due to structural damage of the cargo tank.  The exact cause of release is under investigation.  Evergreen Environmental transferred the contents of the leaking cargo tank into another cargo tank provided by Inca, Inc.  No injuries or exposures were reported.  The MSDS was requested and received.

The vehicle proceeded from a stop at a traffic light turning left or east onto the overpass of connector 3. Upon completing the turn and moving at approximately 5 mph the driver noticed the left side tires of the trailer were off of the roadway and the trailer was leaning to the right. Once the tractor and trailer were stright there was no leverage of the tractor holding the trailer upright and both units turned over on the right side onto the roadway.    The trailer was loaded with nine IBCs each filled with 296 gallons of Sodium Hydroxide 50% Solution. Due to the force of the IBCs stiking the wall of the trailer upon contact with the roadway, one two inch closure installed in a larger seven inch closure was ejected from one container by the force of the liquid impacting the head of the IBC.    Since the IBC was on its side approximately one half of the content or 138 gallons was released into the trailer subsequently escaping onto the roadway and a portion of the liquid came in contact with soil adjacent to the area. This release occured over a 15 minute period.    The local fire department responded initially and contacted a local environmental response contractor to secure the scene and perform cleanup operations. These cleanup activities concluded the following day at approximately 7:30 am.    The Sodium Hydroxide spilled from the container was collected, either in liquid form and transferred to suitable containers or solidified using absorbent and placed in a collection container along with the soil in contact with the material for disosal.","Personnel reviewed loading, blocking and bracing procedures and received training both prior to and after the incident as required by the Hazmat Employee Training requirements.

Box 68900,SEATTLE,WA,98168,Carrier,A crate was tendered as a non-hazardous shipment.  It was originally scheduled to move to ANC on our freighter.  Shipper wanted it to leave earlier on a passenger flight.  The crate was too large to fit throught the belly door of our passenger aircraft.  The shippers representative came out to our facility to see if they could shorten the crate.  When it was opened we discovered that the contents were an internal combustion engine.  The engine was not new and had a gas tank attached.  The tank was empty but contained some fuel residue.  There were no markings or labeling to indicate there was an engine inside.    We immediately set the shipment aside and placed a hold on it.  We contacted the local FAA Haz-Mat office.  The examined and photographed the crate and started an investigation.  They released the shipment back to us and the shipper terminated it and picked it up later that afternoon.,Our company does an excellent job of using trigger terms to determine if there could be concealed haz-mat.  In this case there was nothing to indicate further probing should be done.

PATTERSON,DEPOT TRANSPORTATION MANGER,1331 Metcalf Road,FOREST PARK,GA,30297,Facility,"Driver was hooked up with pump truck to railcar and transport trailer loading his trailer. Train stopped on main line to cut cars loose that were to be placed on our siding. The engineer blew his horn at our driver. The driver waved back at the engineer. They driver went back to watching his trailer as the train went on down the line to move into our siding. The driver assumed the crew was going to push the cars onto the sidng and return the next day to make the swap. At this location we are set up to have a swap on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. When the train stopped on the siding our driver started up the track toward a crew member walking down the track. They  waved at each other and our driver returned to watching his trailer as he was getting close to being loaded.The train crew member turned and started walking back up the track. As the driver was watching his trailer he noticed/heard the couplers tighten up on the cars. He looked down the track to see what was happening and saw a crew member standing over by the main line with his back turned toward our driver looking down toward the engine. As our driver began to move toward this crew member  waving and shouting trying to get his attention he looked back and saw the pump truck over turn. When the truck over turned the train crew member heard the noise turned around and saw what had happened and got the train stopped. This was the 3rd load of the day for this driver. He had placed his blue car connected sign at the beginning of his shift. He checked the sign when he returned for his second load and it was still in place. The driver did not check the 3rd time to see if the sign was in place. In interviewing both Rome drivers it has been the pratice that when the train crew came in and our truck was there a member of the crew  would walk down and ask if everything was ready for them to move the cars. On this day that did not take place. The only contact our driver had with the crew was when he waved at them from a distance.",Each driver now has a blue stopped connected sign that they will place on the railcar before they start loading and will remove after they finish loading and take their sign with them. No sign will be left in place or hoses connected when a driver is not at the rail siding. Derailer will be installed that will be locked in place by each driver and unlocked when they leave.,Yes,TANK CAR,Pressure,105AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,1368,BOC Gases,US,

The carton contained exhibit materials, which consisted of an assortment of items including flyers, binders, packing material, a steel carton, and two (2) plastic bottles of Sklar Disinfectant.  Upon opening the box, it was determined that the cap had come loose from one (1) 24 ounce plastic bottle of Sklar Disinfectant, and it had lost its contents inside the container.  The product had already dried upon discovery, and no free product remained.  The entire carton was placed into a poly bag, which was held in a recovery drum at the Toledo Hub, pending disposition from the shipper.

On entering a curve he met a car on his side of the road. To avoid a collison with the car driver veered to his right. This occured where a culvert runs under the pavement of the road which is seriously eroded an approximate depth of 30 feet on either side. The trailer axles   dropped off the roadbed when the earth gave way.The tanker rolled over one and three quarter times and came to rest on its end within 15 feet of the pavement.The tractor, which had cleared the culvert, jack-knifed and came to rest on an embankment.Leakage came from the manway vents during the turning over process.Site  was secured by absorbent materials.Crude oil was removed by vacuum thru lower safety valves and loaded on another truck. The remainder was sucked from manhose and taken to secure site. No release visible during the uprighting of vehicle nor after. Absorbent pads were changed after a subsequent rain and site was monitored for several days.Earth disturbed was smoothed and strawed by KORC employees.",Transporter was observing speed regulations and on his side of the highway when accident occurred.

He went across intersection, put down triangles and flagged someone down to call the fire dept.  He had spill cleaned up with spill pads by time the fire dept got there.  They just said good job and left. Driver said the front washout cap was missing.  Some product dripped off trailer onto the asphalt shoulder and pretty much evaporated.

The accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid an object in the road. The tanker trailer rolled onto its side and ruptured, releasing approximately 2,800 gallons of diesel onto Mamalahoa Highway. The spilled diesel ran approximately 400 feet northwest along the southeastern shoulder of the highway to a culvert outlet. The spilled diesel then ran approximately 190 feet northeast within an unnamed stream (flowing with water from the culvert) with two waterfalls and small ponds at the base of each waterfall, and ended up in a marsh approximately 400 feet from the coastline. The spilled diesel impacted asphalt and soil along the highway, as well as water in the stream and marsh. Field observations on October 19 through 21, 2005 indicated that the spilled diesel did not reach the Pacific Ocean or otherwise impact it. Hawaii Petroleum, Inc. (HP1) orally reported the release to the National Response Center (NRC); Hawaii County Police and Fire Departments (HP and ITFD); Hawaii Department of Transportation (HDOT); Hawaii Department of Health, Hazard Evaluation &   Emergency Response Office (DOll-BEER).

I immediately called our fleet manager, Albert Cirino, who was closer to the scene of the accident. He called me and told me that it was Harbey. Our insurance company was notified and they immediately sent Miller Environmental Group to the accident to start the clean up. I, myself, headed to the Bronx where I was met by detectives from the 41” Precinct, Kevin Stockert from Highway #1, Special Accident Investigations Unit, The NY/FBI Terrorist Task Force, officials from the Police, Fire and DOT Units, Con Ed, Keyspan, Amtrack, Nynex and the Hazmat Units. I was told that Mr. Mark Berger, from the NYSDOT, had called my fleet manager and told him to expect a call from a Ms. Melissa Townsend from the U.S. DOT. She called to schedule an operation audit, after which time, a satisfactory rating to operate was given.  By the time I arrived at the scene, the fire was out. There was sand and foam spread out all over the area. I learned from Detective Stocker, from Highway 1, that he suspected the driver had been speeding. The truck had come around a sharp turn traveling at 47 MPH. I learned that the sand had been pushed out into the street by Casa Building Material, located about 75 feet from the truck fire, when fuel started to leak from the truck. This alone was able to contain a large part of the oil from traveling further, preventing a bad situation from becoming even worse.  I had first suspected that a truck, coming out of the Casa Building Material Company yard, had somehow cut off Harbey. I hired a private investigator to look into this. (I have enclosed his report). I believe now, that this accident was indeed caused by driver error.  I have since hired Mr. Anthony Natale to coordinate monthly meetings with the drivers, to implement safety procedures, while operating their trucks. Attendance for all drivers is mandatory. These meetings have noticeably improved our daily work habits.  I assumed that because Ms. Melissa Townsend of DOT performed the audit, and indeed knew of the accident, that the department would have been notified by her. Having never dealt with an accident of this nature, or with a job related fatality, we were not sure of the proper procedure with forms. While we do not anticipate any accident to this degree to occur, should anything as unfortunate as this accident ever happen to us again, we will be fully prepared as far as procedures are concerned. I am enclosing a copy of Ms. Townsend’s satisfactory rating for our company.  Here is a list of all contacts, which were involved.

The head end was at approximately MPQ68 of our Cleveland sub division. The crew began to walk their train and found the  36th-43rd cars derailed and tank cars were on their side derailed. Dispatch intructed train crew to return to the head end and wait for WLE responding supervision. At 21:30 Jim Hill, Division Superintendent on site, notified myself:, Jeff Clapper, and WLL dispatch that UTLX 202293 was leaking. Dispatch called Chemtrec and the shipper, Jeff Clapper contacted local fire emergency personnel and the Ohio EPA. UTLX 202293 was leaking from a damaged bottom outlet valve. The leak was stopped at 0300, 10-27-05 through a combined effort of Eagle Environmental, WLE contractor, WLE personnel ar.d local first responders by the use of a magnet clamping patch device. Spilled, pooled product (acetone) was recovered and disposed of. The product in UTLX 202293 was transloaded to tank car GATX 25895, which was provided by WLE. This car was an empty acetone car in Sunoco’s service, the shipper. The transload was completed at 0400 on 10-28-05. Car was rerailed at approximately 1000 on 10-28-05.    The derailment was caused by wide gauge. The 36 car in the train dropped into the rail when the train went into emergency rail broke under the train. A piece of broken rail struck the bottom outlet valve of the UTLX 202293 tank car which was the 39th car in the train. When the valve was struck by the broken rail it knocked the bottom flange of the valve body off causing the bottom outlet valve to leak.",,Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,776340,WHEELING & LAKE ERIE,US,
