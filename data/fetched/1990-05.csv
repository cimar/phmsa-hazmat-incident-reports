I CALLED DISPOSAL CONTROL SERVICE AND TOLD THEM THE SITUATION. I THEN CALLE D THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK AND GOT DIRECTIONS AS TO WHERE HE HAD STOPPED. I THEN  CALLED BACK DISPOSAL CONTROL SERVICE  AND REQUESTED  THAT THEY MEET M E AT THE SPILL SITE. I WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE AT THE SPILL SITE, AND BEGAN TO INSPECT THE TRUCK INSIDE AND OUTSIDE. THE TRUCK WAS CARRYING 6 TOTE TANKS FILLED WITH CLEAR LACQUER AND CLEAR LAC QUER SANDING SEALER. I RE-ENTERED THE TRUCK AND DISCOVERED THAT ON TOP OF O NE OF THE TOTES (TANK #102) MATERIAL 401-90C018-750 WAS LEAKING FROM THE TO P WHERE  THE RING WAS CLAMPED DOWN ON THE TOTE. I PRECEDED TO REMOVE  THE R ING  AND DISCOVERED NO RUBBER GASKET WAS THERE, ALSO A LARGE  WET PUDDLE OF LACQUER ON TOP OF THE TOTE AND DOWN THE SIDE. I LEFT THE LID UNSCREWED AND GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK TO GET SOME FRESH AIR. THE SPILL WAS CAUSED FROM NO GASKET AND SLOSHING AROUND BACK AND FORTH THRO UGH THE METAL BUNG AND DOWN THE SIDE. AT THIS TIME, THE DISPOSAL CONTROL SERVICE  HAD ARRIVED , AND ADVISED US TH AT WE CALL THE FIRE DEPT DUE TO THE EXTREMELY BAD FUMES AND THE HIGH RISK O F EXPLOSION. THEY ALSO ADVISED US TO CALL DEPT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. WHEN THE FIRE DEPT AND DPS ARRIVED AT THE SPILL SITE THE CONCLUSION REACHED WAS TO MOVE THE TRUCK TO ANOTHER PLACE AWAY FROM THE PRIVATE LOT THE TRUCK WAS PARKED ON. I INFORMED THAT  THE LID  I HAD REMOVED EARLIER WAS NOT  SE CURE AND THAT IT WOULD NEED SECURED BEFORE MOVING  THE TRUCK. THIS THEY DID AT THE PRIVATE  LOT WHICH WAS THE SPILL SITE. THIS WAS DONE BY THE DISPOSA L TEAM INSIDE THE TRUCK. THEY SECURED  THE TOTE TANK (#102) WITH THICK VISQ UEEN AND SCREWED DOWN THE LID. THEY THEN LET THE TRUCK AIR OUT. I THEN WENT BACK INSIDE THE TRUCK MYSELF TO GIVE THE FINAL INSPECTION. AT T HIS TIME, I HEARD A HISSING AND DRIPPING SOUND. UPON INSPECTION, I DISCOVER ED ANOTHER TOTE  THAT WAS AGAINST THE BED OF THE TRUCK, HAD A 3"" CRACK ABOU T 12"" DOWN FROM THE TOP ON TANK #52. MATERIAL 401-90C018-750.
