THE DRIVER'S LAST STOP OF THE DAY WAS AT COMPUTER & SOURCE MICROFILMING ON 145 MIDLER DRIVE - SYRACUSE, NY - EPA #NYD982726747. THE DRIVER INSPECTED THE DRUMS TO INSURE THEY WERE IN GOOD CONDITION PRIOR TO LOADING THEM AS HE DOES AT ALL PICK UP LOCATIONS. THE DRUMS WERE LOADED, MANIFESTS AND OTHER REQUIRED PAPERWOEK WAS COMPLETED, THE TRUCK WAS PLACARDED ACCORDINGLY, AND THE DRIVER DEPARTED FROM COMPUTER & SOURCE MICROFILMING. EVIDENTLY, WHILE ENROUTE BACK TO OUR FACILITY ONE THE DRUMS LOADED AT COMPUTER & SOURCE MICROFILMING DEVELOPED A LEAK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DRUM. WHEN THE DRIVER, ALLEN SNETSINGER, PULLED OUT OF THE TOLL BOOTH AT EXIT 34 - CANASTOTA, NY, PERSONNEL AT THE BOOTH NOTICED LIQUID DRIPPING OUT OF THE REAR PORTION OF THE VEHICLE. THE THRUWAY AUTHORITY TELEPHONED US IMMEDIATELY TO ALERT US OF THE SPILL. NES IMMEDIATELY PREPARED OUR REMEDIATION CREW FOR DISPATCH TO ASSESS AND CLEAN UP THE SPILL. AT THAT SAME TIME THE NEW TRANSPORT VEHICLE PULLED INTO OUR FACILITY WHERE HE WAS RECEIVED BY THE REMEDIATION CREW QUICKLY PUT A DRUM UNDERNEATH PROPERTIES OF THE LEAKING WASTE TO COLLECT IT. AFTER ASSESSING THE LEAKER WAS LOCATED AND TURNED UPSIDE DOWN TO STOP THE RELEASE. FROM THE LABEL ON THE DRUM IT WAS ASCERTAINED TO BE THE MATERIAL LISTED ON MANIFEST NO.

THE REMEDIATION CREW DROVE TO THE EXIT 34 TOLL BOOTH TO CLEAN UP WHAT WAS DESCRIBED  AS A ""PUDDLE"". THE WASTE WAS SOAKED UP WITH ABSORBENT MATERIALS AND PUT INTO A 55 GALLON OPEN TOP DRUM. THE ROADWAY WAS THEN PRESSURE WASHED, THE FACILITY PERSONNEL WERE SHOVELING UP DIRT WHICH WAS CONTAMINATED NEAR THE FACILITY ENTRANCE/ROAD. BASED UPON THE VOLUME OF WASTE REMAINING IN THE ORIGINAL DRE\UM AND THAT WHICH WAS RECOVERED AT THE TOLL BOOTH, NES ESTIMATES A LOSS OF BETWEEN 10 - 20 GALLONS OF WASTE MATERIAL.
