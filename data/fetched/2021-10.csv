Crew advised the valve on the tote was cracked open and there was no cam-lock fitting on the tote. A new fitting was obtained and the tote was re-secured for shipment. Absorbents were worked into the impacted areas and then collected. All waste was containerized into (2) 55 gallon metal and (1) 55 gallon poly drums.

The car was isolated and assessed by local Fire Department and CP Contractors, with no further vapor release found.  The pressure relief device was found to have the spring retainer and spring not tight, allowing the poppet to be displaced and vapor to be released.  When the Girard T-Wrench was engaged into the spring retainer, the retainer was approximately ¼ turn from being tight. The spring retainer was adjusted, allowing the valve to re-seat properly.  Upon testing the pressure relief valve by adding pressure to the car, it was discovered that the pressure plate (B-right side) was found to leak at approximately 20 psi of applied pressure.  The bolts were torqued to specifications, with the bolts in that area found about ¼ turn loose.  When pressure was re-applied, however, the plate still leaked at approximately 20psi.   The car was then bled of pressure and secured.  Pending an OTMA-1 authorization, the car will be moved to homeshop for repair and re-certification.","Upon discussion with CP's Contractor and the Shipper, it has been discovered that several similar incidents have occurred with the Girard safety valve, with the poppet not seating properly, due to retainer slack, allowing for vapor to be released.    I would suggest a closer look at any incidences that involve this model of safety valve to determine if there is any indications of slack developing over a period of time with the spring retainer system.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY,US,

(WFS) driver was top loading a cargo tank motor vehicle. The driver was loading two separate compartments while using two different loading arms at the WFS Millersburg Bulk Plant. The first load arm’s remote-control device mechanically failed. The remote-control device’s lever got stuck in the open position and could not be closed. By the time the driver was able to force it closed, a few gallons of diesel had overflowed the compartment. The driver then panicked and went to grab spill supplies and neglected the other load arm and did not stop flow. The driver left the point of discharge without stopping flow. As the driver returned with spill clean-up supplies, the second load arm/compartment was overflowing with diesel. The driver then ran and stopped the flow on the load arm. Approximately, 300 gallons of diesel was released. The release was contained to the concrete pad that drains to an oil/water separator and dirt/gravel around to the concrete pad. All product was recovered by cleaning the concrete pad, removing impacted dirt and gravel, and by pumping out the oil/water separator. The driver reported the spill to his plant manager and was then reported to HSSE Manager. The HSSE manager then mobilized their emergency spill response contractor and notify the NRC, Ohio EPA, and LEPC. The WFS site was fully cleaned-up and all material was properly disposed of.","World Fuel Services, Inc. (WFS) investigates and reviews all incidents, in order, to determine the root cause, preventability, and what actions, i.e., training or procedures, need to be conducted or implemented so that the incident will not happen again. The primary cause of the spill/release was human error, the driver did not stop flow before leaving and the secondary cause was due to the load arm’s remote-control device temporarily malfunctioning. WFS conducts multiple driver focused safety meetings during the year. On November 4, 2021, WFS briefed plant managers about the incident and its preventability and required them to review the incident with their drivers. Also, they reviewed the importance of never leaving the point of discharge and to stop all flow if you need to step away. And, reminded drivers about emergency shut offs as an option for stopping flow if the facility is equipped with one. WFS is currently making ‘Never Leave the Point of Discharge” signs to post at all load racks to serve as a visual reminder for drivers. Going forwarded all load arms will be periodically inspected for operational integrity and drivers will be instructed to report any issues discovered during loading to their manager so they can be addressed.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,19000,"WORLD FUEL SERVICES, INC.",US,

CSX Hazardous Materials Team personnel contacted the railroad and repsonse contractor of the previous incident for details, and obtained the response report. At the request of the shipper, response personnel opened and visually inspected the material in UTLX 200592, observed discoloring and solids present however no active reaction. An in-kind compatible frangible disc was provided by the shipper of record and installed. The car was held and observed for 96 hours and the continuous vent device was inspected and found to be working normally and no pressure present. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move. 7.1 is not required.
