I SECURED THE AREA CHECKED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE GUIDE BOOK.  I OPENED THE TRAILER DOOR AND WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM WHAT WAS LEAKING.  I THEN CLOSED THE TRAILER DOOR AGAIN AND CALLED EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM AT GENERAL OFFICE.  I WAS PUT IN CONTACT WITH EDDIE YANCE.  I EXPLAINED EVERYTHING I KNEW TO HIM AND THEN FOLLOWED HIS INSTRUCTION.  THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE: 1- PUT ON HAZMAT GEAR, 2- TURN THE DRUM OVER TO STOP THE LEAK, 3- CONTAIN THE SPILL WITH OIL DRY, 4- CALL EMERGENCY RESPONSE NUMBER ON THE BOL, 5- KEEP THE AREA SECURE.  I FOLLOWED THESE INSTRUCTION.  I WASN'T ABLE TO GET A RESPONSE FROM THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE #'S THAT WERE ON THE BILL.  I CALLED EDDIE YANCE BACK AND EXPLAINED THIS TO HIM.  HE THEN INSTRUCTED ME TO CONTACT CHEMTRIC BECAUSE WE HAD TO HAVE MSDS DOCUMENTS.  MAYBE HE COULD OBTAIN THEM FOR US.  I FOLLOWED THESE INSTRUCTIONS.  CHEMTRIC WAS VERY HELPFUL AND WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS FOR ME.  HE ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO ATTEMPT TO CONTACT THE SHIPPER AND PUT ME IN CONTACT WITH SIMILAR SHIPPERS THAT DEAL WITH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE.  AFTER RECEIVING THE MSDS FROM CHEMTREC I AGAIN PHONED MR. YANCE AND DISCUSSED THIS INFORMATION THAT I HAD OBTAINED.  ON THE SPECIAL PROTECTION INFORMATION PORTION ON THE MSDS IN STATED THAT SELF CONTAINED SUPPLIED AIR WOULD BE NEEDED.  MR. YANCE INSTRUCTED ME TO CALL HEPACO AT THIS POINT AND INFORM THEM THAT WE NEEDED THEIR ASSISTANCE.  I FOLLOWED THESE INSTRUCTIONS - WHILE WAITING FOR HEPACO I RECEIVED A CALL FROM DAVID SWATZ.  HE IS A DUPONT HAZMAT RESPONSE REPRESENTATIVE WHO HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN HAZMAT SPILLS WITH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE.  CHEMTRIC CONTACTED HIM AND EXPLAINED WHAT I HAD.  HE THEN CONTACTED ME.  HE WAS VERY HELPFUL WITH HIS INSTRUCTION AND KNOWLEDGE.  HE EXPLAINED THAT IF THE SPILL WAS IN A WELL VENTILATED AREA WE COULD PROCEED WITH THE CLEAN UP AT A COMPANY LEVEL.  HE EXPLAINED HOW I COULD DO THIS, WITH FULL INSTRUCTION AND CAUTION I WOULD NEED TO FOLLOW.  I THEN CONTACTED MR. YANCE AGAIN AND EXPLAINED THIS CONVERSATION.  MR. YANCE STATED THAT HE TRUSTED DUPONT BECAUSE OF THEIR PAST EXPERIENCE AND GAVE ME THE OKAY TO PROCEED WITH CLEAN UP.  HEPACO SHOWED UP AFTER I FINISHED TALKING WITH MR. YANCE.  I EXPLAINED TO HIM (KEN WALDEN) THAT I RECEIVED ASSISTANCE AND WOULD NOW PERFORM THE CLEAN UP AT OUR COMPANY LEVEL. HE WAS VERY HELPFUL AND AGREED THAT THE CLEAN UP PROCESS THAT EXPLAINED TO HIM WOULD BE PERFECTLY ALRIGHT.  I THEN PROCEEDED WITH THE CLEAN UP.  I FIRST PUT ON ALL HAZMAT PROTECTIVE GEAR.    I THEN MET ALL THE CONTAMINATED AREA DOWN WITH WATER.  I THEN SWEPT UP ALL OF THE OIL DRY THAT WAS USED TO CONTAIN THE SPILL,  AND PLACED IT IN A 55 GALLON RECOVERY DRUM.

I WENT TO INVESTIGATE. I FIRST TRIED TO FIND THE BILL. I ASKED SANFORD BROWN WHO CAUSED THE ACCIDENT. HE TOLD ME MATT MAGEE. I SEEN MATT MAGGEE WALKING OUT OF THE BREAK ROOM WITH HIS LUNCH BOX IN HIS HAND. I ASKED MATT FOR THE BILL. HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE THE BILL ON THE HAZ MAT SPILL. HE THEN SAID HE WAS FED UP WITH THIS PLACE AND HE QUIT. FINALLY AFTER ABOUT THREE MINUTE. I OBTAINED THE BILL. SEEING THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF HAZ MAT ON THIS SHIPMENT AND SEEING ALOT OF ACIDS AND OXIDIZERS I EVACUATEDTHE LOWER END OF THE DOCK. DURING THIS TIME I SEEN WHAT MATERIAL HAD BEEN BUSTED. I CHECKED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE GUIDE BOOK. I KEPT ALL EMPLOYEES OFF THE LOWER END BECAUSE OF THE INFORMATION I GATHERED ON THE MATERIAL. I THEN CALLED OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE NUMBER AT THE GENERAL OFFICE AND WAS PUT IN TOUCH WITH EDDIE YANCE. I THEN GAVE HIM ALL THE INFORMATION I HAD AND FOLLOWED HIS INSTRUCTIONS. THEY WERE AS FOLLOWS 1ST SECURE THE AREA WITH TAPE OR ROPE APPROXIMATELY 15 FEET AROUND THE SPILL IN ALL DIRECTION. ALSO LAY DOWN ADSORBENT MATERIAL TO PREVENT THE SPILL FROM SPREADING. 2ND CALL CHEMTRIC TO GET AN MSDS. 3RD TRY AND CONTACT REAGENTS. 4TH LOOK OVER THE MSDS TO SEE IF WE WILL NEED ASSISTANCE IN THE CLEAN UP OR IF WOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAN UP AT COMPANY LEVEL. I FOLLOWED THESE INSTRUCTIONS. WHEN I CALLED CHEMTRIC I WAS CONNECTED WITH JEFFREY BANMAN. I EXPLAINED EVERYTHING TO HIM. HE WASN'T ABLE TO OBTAIN A MSDS FROM REAGENTS. HE SENT ME THE MSDS THAT HE DID HAVE ON THE MOST POTENT SOLUTION OF SODIUM HYDROXIDE COULD FIND. WHILE LOOKING OVER THIS MSDS HE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT WE COULD CLEAN THIS UP AT A COMPANY LEVEL. HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS. PUT ON RUBBER GLOVES, APRON AND FACE AND EYE PROTECTION. LAY DOWN ABSORBENT ON ALL CONTAMINATED AREA. GET ALL OF THE MATERIAL SWEPT UP AND CONTAINED IN A RECOVERY CONTAINER. I FOLOWED THESE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE CLEAN-UP. I WASN'T ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH REAGENTS. DURING THE CLEAN-UP, ROBERT WESTBROOK WAS ABLE TO MAKE OUT A UN# THAT WAS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I HAD REPORTED. THE ACID HAD BURNED OFF 80% OF THE LABLES ON THE BUSTED CONTAINERS, BUT ON A BUSTED PIECE. OF GLASS HE NOTICED A UN# 2031. I HAD REPORTED THE SPILL TO BE SODIUM HYDROXIDE (8), UN 1824, PGII. THE DESCRIPTION ON THE UN 2031 WAS NITRIC ACID. HOWEVER THERE IS A 0 UNDER THE SHIPPING UNITS. AFTER FUTHER INVESTIGATION NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A WEIGHT OF 15 LBS BESIDE BOTH DESCRIPTIONS LISTED ABOVE.I HAVE ATTACHED A COPY OF THE BILL. HAND WRITTEN ON THE BOX THAT THESE MATERIALS WERE SHIPPED IN. I FOUND BOTH SODIUM HYDROXIDE AND NITRIC ACID WRITTEN THERE. ROBERT HAD ALREADY HAD EVERYTHING PUT IN THE RECOVERY DRUM. I THEN CALLED CHEMTRIC AGAIN AND EXPLAINED THAT THE WRONG MATERIAL HAD BEEN REPORTED. MR.

A SUNOCO EMPLOYEE NOTICED MATERIAL LEAKING OUT OF THE TRAILER ONTO THE GROUND.  SUNOCO CALLED THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION WHO THEN CALLED THE DENTON FIRE DEPARTMENT.  OFFICER DON STEWERT THEN CALLED HUB CITY DISPATCH TO REPORT THE LEAK.  THE DENTON FIRE DEPARTMENT CALLED ME 5 MINUTES LATER.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE LEAK WAS COMING OUT OF THE REAR VALVE AT A RATE OF 1 GAL. PER HOUR THEY ESTIMATED THAT THERE WAS APROX. 1-2 GALS ALREADY ON SOFT GROUND, NO RUNOFF CONCERN, COVERING A 10FT BY 4FT AREA.  RANDY HALL, JAMES MARSHALL, ANDY FIELDS, AND MYSELF DISCUSSED THE SITUATION AND DECIDED TO CONTACT EAGLE'S FT WORTH OFFICE TO HAVE A REMEDIATION CREW DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE.

THEY INSPECTED THE VALVE, STOPPED THE LEAK, AND RECOVERED APROX. 3 GALS OF MATERIAL FROM THE GROUND.  THE DRIVER ARRIVED AT APROX. 5:45 AND WAS ISSUED A CITATION DUE TO THE LEAK BY THE DENTON FIRE DEPARTMENT.  CAUSE OF INCIDENT:  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT SOLID MATERTIAL WAS LODGED IN THE INTERNAL VALVE DURING UNLOADING WHICH ALLOWED LIQUID TO PASS THROUGH TO THE EXTERNAL GATE VALVE, WHEN THE TRAILER WAS PARKED EARLY THURSDAY MORNING THERE WAS NOT A LEAK. WHILE SITTING IN THE MID-DAY SUN PRESSURE BUILT UP WHICH FORCED LIQUID THROUGH THE EXTERNAL GATE VALVE AND INTO THE OUTER CAP WHICH DIDN'T HAVE A GASKET THEREFORE ALLOWING WASTE TO DRIP OUT AND CREATE THE SPILL.

TRUCK DRIVER NOTICED TOO LATE, SLAMMED ON BRAKES BUT HIT CAR IMMEDIATELY AHEAD OF TRUCK.  NO INJURIES NOR WAS EITHER VEHICLE TOWED, BUT THE VIOLENT DOUBLE FORCE ON BRAKE ACTION FOLLOWED BY IMPACT RESULTED IN SCHEDULE 80 PVC FITTING CRACKED JUST OUTSIDE TANK WALL.  THE HIGH-DENSITY CROSSLINKED 1450 GALLON CAPACITY TANK WAS UNDAMAGED, BUT THE BROKEN FITTING ALLOWED SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE BLEACH, UN1791 (10% BY WEIGHT) LADING TO ESCAPE AS DESCRIBED.  VERTEX DISPATCHED A BACKUP TRAILER TO PUMP OFF APPROXIMATELY 100 GALLONS WHICH REMAINED IN THE TRUCK UNSPILLED.  RESIDUE OF 1300 GALLONS WHICH WAS SPILLED ON ROADWAY/SHOULDER FLOWED INTO ROADSIDE DITCH.  VERTEX, AT THE INSTRUCTION OF THE IL EPA EMERGENCY RESPONSE OFFICER WHO SUPERVISED THE RESPONSE OF THIS EVENT, HAD THIS RESIDUE PUMPED INTO ANOTHER VERTEX TRAILER AND REMOVED FROM THE SITE FOR RECLAMATION AND TREATMENT IF NECESSARY.  WHAT WAS REMOVED DID NOT MEET THE STANDARD OF A HAZARDOUS WASTE OR A SOLID WASTE.  CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE HAYWARD PVC FITTING (RATED FOR #150 PRESSURE) SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL DAMAGE.  APPARENTLY HYDRAULIC PRESSURE COMBINED WITH THE SHOCK OF IMPACT CAUSED THE FITTING TO CRACK.  TIGHTNESS OF STEEL SADDLE SUPPORTS AND WEIGHT OF PRODUCT PREVENTS ANY MOVEMENT OF THIS TANK DURING SHIPMENT.  VERTEX HAS USED HAYWARD PVC FITTINGS ON THESE NON SPECIFICATION TANK AS WELL AS DOT 312 AND NOW, DOT 412 SPECIFICATION RIGS FOR PIPING FOR SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE FOR MANY YEARS AS THE BEST AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE FOR THE PRODUCT.  THIS PRODUCT IS COMPARATIVELY LOW IN CORROSIVITY ON TISSUE AND IN THE ENVIRONMENT, BUT IS EXTREMELY  CORROSIVE TO METALS.  PLASTIC LINED METAL PIPE GIVES BETTER MECHANICAL STRENGTH, BUT SINCE UNSEEN DAMAGE TO PLASTIC LININGS CAN ALLOW PRODUCT TO ACCESS THE METAL SUBSTRATE WITHOUT WARNING WHICH WILL CAUSE UNCONTROLLED LEAK UNEXPECTEDLY, WELL-PROTECTED PLASTIC PIPING HAS APPEARED TO GIVE THE BEST ALTERNATIVE.  TO PREVENT FUTURE RECURRENCES OF THIS PROBLEM:  SINCE THIS EVENT HAS OCCURRED, VERTEX HAS DECIDED TO INSTALL TITANIUM FITTINGS IN THIS LOCATION, SINCE TITANIUM IS THE ONLY METAL WHICH WILL RESIST THE LADING, OR FRP TANKS WITH MOLDED FITTINGS SINCE FRP MAY GIVE HIGHER CRACK RESISTANCE THAN PVC.",,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,10957,,US,

MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE COLTON YARD AND MET WITH RIALTO FIRE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS CHIEF, WHO HAD SET UP A COMMAND POST WEST OF THE TRIM TOWER. A VISIBLE PLUME OF VAPOR WAS OBSERVED RISING APPROXIMATELY 150 FEET INTO THE AIR. AT THE TIME, THE WINDS WERE CALM. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD MADE AN ENTRY TO ASSESS THE LEAKING TANK CAR, AND FROM THE INITIAL REPORTS, IT WAS DETERMINED THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM THE BOTTOM SKID PLATE OF THE TANK CAR. MANAGER COOPER MADE A FOLLOW UP ENTRY TO INSPECT THE TANK CAR AND CONFIRMED THAT THE PRODUCT WAS COMING FROM THE BOTTOM SKID PLATE, WHICH WAS TOTALLY ENCLOSED, THUS PREVENTING ANY FURTHER OBSERVATION OF THE SUMP AREA OF THE CAR. THE SHIPPER WAS CONTACTED AND SEVERAL OPTIONS WERE DISCUSSED ON THE BEST WAY TO REMOVE THE PRODUCT FROM THE TANK CAR, AS IT APPEARED THE LINER HAD FAILED, AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO EFFECTIVELY STOP THE LEAK AND CONTAIN THE PRODUCT WITHIN THE CAR. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO OBTAIN THE SERVICES FROM SEVERAL OF THE RAILROAD'S HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CONTRACTORS, WHICH ALSO INCLUDED AIR MONITORING. ATTEMPTS TO LOCATE ENOUGH LINED ACID HIGHWAY TRUCKS MET WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS.  A CHECK OF THE YARD LOCATED A LIKE TYPE RAIL TANK CAR, WHICH ALSO BELONGED TO THE SHIPPER.  THE RESIDUE CAR, UTLX 802765, WAS ON AN ADJACENT BOWL TRACK, APPROXIMATELY 10 CAR LENGTHS WEST OF THE LEAKING TANK CAR. ENTRY WAS MADE TO FACILTATE THE REMOVAL OF THE RESIDUE CAR, WHICH WAS SET TO THE LEAD TRACK, WHERE IT COULD BE INSPECTED AND PLUMBED TO RECEIVE THE PRODUCT. ONCE THE TRANSFER OPERATION WAS IN PLACE, THE LEAKING TANK CAR WAS MOVED TO AN ADJACENT TRACK, WHERE IT WAS PLUMBED FOR THE TRANSFER. CONTAINMENT POOLS WERE PLACED UNDER THE LEAKING TANK CAR TO CAPTURE THE PRODUCT LEAKING FROM THE SKID PLATE WHILE THE TRANSFER WAS IN OPERATION. THE PRODUCT FROM THE CONTAINMENT POOLS WERE CAPTURED AND PLACED INTO A HIGHWAY TRUCK. ONCE THE TRANSFER OPERATION STARTED, CREWS WERE MOVED INTO BOWL TRACK 26, WHERE THE PRODUCT ON THE GROUND WAS NEUTRALIZED WITH SODA ASH. ONCE THE AREA WAS NEUTRALIZED, THE RESIDUE WAS PLACED INTO 55  GALLON DRUMS FOR TEMPORARY STORAGE PENDING DISPOSAL. ONCE THE TRANSFER OPERATION WAS COMPLETED, THE DAMAGED RAIL CAR WAS MOVED TO THE GATX TANK CAR REPAIR FACILITY LOCATED AT THE EAST END OF THE YARD, WHERE IT COULD BE INSPECTED AND REPAIRED.

SEVERAL CARS WERE INVOLVED IN THE DERAILMENT, INCLUDING THE ABOVE TANK CAR THAT WAS REPORTED ON IT'S SIDE AND LEAKING.  NO ADDITIONAL DETAILS WERE AVAILABLE AT THE TIME.  MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE DERAILMENT SITE AND MET WITH THE KERN COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TEAM, WHO MADE A PRELIMINARY ENTRY TO ASSESS THE ABOVE TANK CAR AND SEVERAL OTHER RAILCARS.  DEVELOPED THE ABOVE TANK CAR WAS LEAKING FROM THE GENERAL AREA WHERE THE LIQUID EDUCTION LINE AND AIR LINE ARE LOCATED.  AS THE PROTECTIVE COVER WAS IN PLACE, THE TEAM WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE LEAK.  AFTER SOME DISCUSSION WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, IT WAS DECIDED TO MAKE A SECOND ENTRY WITH SOME TOOLS AND ATTEMPT TO STOP THE LEAK.  MANAGER COOPER, IN COMPANY WITH THE KERN COUNTY HAZMAT TEAM, MADE ENTRY TO THE CAR, WHICH WAS LAYING ON IT'S LEFT SIDE AT AT 90 DEGREE ANGLE.  THE PROTECTIVE COVER FOR THE LIQUID LINE WAS OPENED, AND DEVELOPED THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK TO BE FROM THE FLANGE ON THE LIQUID EDUCTION LINE WHERE IT BOLTS TO THE NOZZLE PLATE.  WHILE ALL 4 OF THE MOUNTING NUTS APPEARED TO BE TIGHT, THEY COULD BE TURNED AN ADDITIONAL HALF TURN.  THE TIGHTENING OF THE BOLTS SLOWED THE LEAK TO A STEADY DRIP ESTIMATED TO BE ONE GALLON EVERY 4-5 MINUTES.  IT APPEARED THE FLANGE GASKET WAS DETERIORATED AND WOULD NOT HOLD THE HEAD PRESSURE OF THE LIQUID.  IT WAS DECIDED ANY FURTHER TIGHTENING OF THE NUTS TO CONTROL THE LEAK COULD SNAP THE STUDS.  INSPECTION OF THE BOTTOM OUTLET FOUND THE NOZZLE BELOW THE SKID PLATE HAD BEEN SHEARED OFF. THE INTERNAL BALL VALVE WAS VISIBLE AND WAS DRIPPING PRODUCT AT A RATE OF APPROXIMATELY ONE GALLON EVERY 2-3 MINUTES.  ATTEMPTS TO SLOW THE LEAK BY ADJUSTING THE BALL VALVE, AND EVEN APPLYING PUTTY AROUND THE VALVE FAILED.  ONCE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD MONITORED THE AREA AND AGREED ON THE REMEDIAITION EFFORT, THEY DEPARTED THE SCENE. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO RIGHT THE TANK CAR AND MOVE IT TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE #2 THE FIRST TRANSFER OPERATION STARTING AT 7:45AM.  THE LAST TRUCK WAS FINALLY LOADED AT 1:00PM.  ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH THE ORIGINAL AREA WHERE THE TANK CAR HAD LEAKED DURING THE INITIAL DERAILMENT, AND IN THE AREA WHERE THE CAR HAD BEEN STAGED FOR THE TRANSFER.
