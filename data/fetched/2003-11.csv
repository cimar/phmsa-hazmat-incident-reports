THE DRIVER EXITED THE PLANT FACILITY EN-ROUTE TO IMC NEW WALES FACILITY. WHEN THE DRIVER APPROACHED THE STOP SIGN AT THE END OF THE ENTRANCE ROAD LEADING INTO THE PLANT FACILITY THE SURGE IN THE TANKER CAUSED PRODUCT TO BE FORCED OUT OF THE 2-INCH BLEEDER VALVE. THE DRIVER CONTINUED TO HIS DESTINATION, AS HE WAS NOT AWARE HE HAD DISCHARGED PRODUCT FROM THE VENTING SYSTEM ON THE TRAILER. THE DRIVER ARRIVED AT THE NEW WALES FACILITY UNAWARE THAT HE DISCHARGED APPROXIMATELY 150 GALLONS OF SULFURIC ACID ON THE HIGHWAY. 150 GALLONS OF SULFURIC ACID WAS RELEASED ON IMPERVIOUS SURFACE (ASPHALT). THERE WERE NO INJURIES TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR ANY OF CTL EMPLOYEES. NOTIFICATION WAS MADE TO THE EPA.

TIM ODELL FROM ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALTY SERVICE HANDLED THE SITE PLAN AND HAS PERFORMED THE REQUIRED TEST AND WILL FILE THE REQUIRED REPORTS. IMMEDIATE ACTION: CTL SENT A CLEAN UP CREW OUT TO SPREAD LIME AND SODA ASH TO NEUTRALIZE THE AFFECTED AREAS. THE DRIVER IN QUESTION WAS INSTRUCTED TO RETURN TO THE MULBERRY TERMINAL FOR MAINTENANCE TO INSPECT THE EQUIPMENT AFTER THE LOAD WAS UNLOADED. IN THE INITIAL INSPECTION OF THE EQUIPMENT IT WAS FOUND THAT THE BRAKE-INTERLOCK HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH. THE EXHAUST PORT OF THE AIR DISCHARGE HAD BEEN BLOCKED OFF. HAD THE BRAKE INTER-LOCK BEEN FUNCTIONING PROPERLY THE DRIVER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RELEASE THE BRAKES UNTIL THE BLEEDER VALVE IS IN THE CLOSED POSITION. CORRECTIVE ACTION: ALL UNIT EQUIPPED WITH A BRAKE-INTERLOCK SYSTEM HAVE BEEN INSPECTED FOR TAMPERING AND PROPER WORKING CONDITION. ADDITIONAL MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO PREVENT TAMPERING AND MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO MINIMIZE THE ABILITY FOR SOMEONE TO ALTER THE BRAKE INTER-LOCK MECHANISM. SAFETY BULLETINS HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO ALL SULFURIC ACID DRIVERS.  TERMINAL MANAGERS IN EACH LOCATION  HAVE PERSONALLY ADDRESSED THIS INCIDENT WITH EACH DRIVER. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DRIVER HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT THE BRAKE INTER-LOCK MECHANISM WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY.

THE WORK WAS CONDUCTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2003 BY BECK ENVIRONMENTAL AND REMEDIATION, LTD. UNDER THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY'S 2002 GUIDANCE (UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK RELEASE REPORTING AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS).  THE SPILL OCCURRED ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE TUSD BUS YARD, WHERE THERE ARE TWO, 2,000 GALLON, ASTS (DIESEL AND GASOLINE), USED TO FUEL THE TUSD VEHICLES.  AN ESTIMATED SPILL OF APPROXIMATELY 130 TO 140 GALLONS OF GASOLINE OCCURRED ON NOVEMBER 7, 2003 DURING THE DELIVERY OF UNLEADED (NON-OXYGENATED) GASOLINE TO THE TUSD 2,000 GALLON DOUBLE-WALLED, STEEL, AST.  GASOLINE WAS REPORTED TO HAVE OVERFLOWED THE TANK FILL OPENING AND SPRAYED OUT OF THE VENT PIPE.  THE VENT PIPE ON THE AST WAS AT THE SAME ELEVATION AS THE FILL OPENING.  THE APPARENT IMPACTED GROUND SURFACE (GRAVEL COVER) WAS UP TO 12 FEET AWAY. THE FOLLOWING DAY (NOVEMBER 8, 2003), CKC OF SAFFORD, ARIZONA EXCAVATED THE SOILS FROM AROUND THE AST TO A DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 1.2 FEET AND PLACED THE EXCAVATED SOILS ON PLASTIC FOR LATER DISPOSAL.  TO ALLOW FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND CLEAN-UP, THE ASTS WERE MOVED.  THE EXCAVATED AREA WAS THEN COVERED WITH PLASTIC.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2003, A SITE ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED THAT INCLUDED:  SURFACE SOIL GAS SURVEY, DRILLING AND SAMPLING OF THREE SOIL BORINGS AND ON SITE ANALYSIS OF THE COLLECTED SOIL SAMPLES FOR PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS WITH A STATE-CERTIFIED MOBILE LABORATORY.  THE IMPACTED SOILS MAXIMUM TOTAL PETROLEUM HYDROCARBONS WERE 500 MILLIGRAMS PER KILOGRAM (MG/KG) WITH 0.26 MG/KG BENZENE.  THESE DETECTIONS ARE BELOW THE ADEQ SOIL REMEDIATION LEVELS.  THE SOIL GAS SURVEY FOUND THAT THE APPARENT IMPACTED SOILS WERE MAINLY WITHIN THE FOOT PRINT OF THE GASOLINE AST.  THE SOIL BORINGS WITH THE ASSOCIATED SOIL ANALYSES FOUND THAT THE SOILS WERE NOT IMPACTED BELOW A DEPTH TWO FEET.  THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GASOLINE RELEASED TO THE SOILS WAS LESS THAN 40 GALLONS.  INSPECTION OF THE AST FOUND AT LEAST 80 GALLONS OF GASOLINE STILL WITHIN THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT OF THE AST.  THUS, FROM THE AMOUNT GASOLINE FOUND IN THE SECONDARY CONTAINMENT OF THE AST AND THE AMOUNT REPORTED SPILLED, MOST OF THE SPILLED GASOLINE HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR.  THE REMAINING IMPACTED SOIL AREA WAS DELINEATED FOR REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL WITH THE SOILS EXCAVATED BY CKC.

(EAGLE) TO RESPOND TO A TRANSPORTATION INCIDENT AT THE ABOVE MENTIONED LOCATION. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SITE, AT APPROXIMATELY 22:55 HRS, MARK CHURCHILL, EMERGENCY RESPONSE MANAGER FOR RMCAT, MET WITH AUTHORITIES FROM COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (CDOT), JULESBERG FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE COLORADO STATE PATROL (CSP). CSP HAZMAT TECHNICIANS BOB OWENS AND GORDON GOLDSMITH HAD PERFORMED AN ENTRY INTO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER IN SUPPLIED AIR RESPIRATORS TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE AND THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF WASTE LEAKAGE THAT HAD OCCURRED. THIS INITIAL ASSESSMENT HAD DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF DISTRESSED AND DISTORTED DRUMS FROM THE RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE ACCIDENT. SPILT WASTE IN THE TRAILER EXHIBITED A PH IN THE NEUTRAL RANGE WITH AN ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF SPILLAGE AT 10-20 GALLONS. AIR MONITORING INSIDE THE TRAILER INDICATED AN LEL BELOW 10% WITH THE OXYGEN LEVEL IN THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE FOR WORK IN THE TRAILER WITH AIR PURIFYING RESPIRATORS. IT WAS DECIDED BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY INFORMATION GATHERED THAT AIR MONITORING WOULD BE PERFORMED AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE TRAILER TO ENSURE NO HAZARDOUS CONDITION EXITED THAT WOULD PRECLUDE RE-OPENING WESTBOUND I-76. RMCAT THEN PERFORMED AIR MONITORING INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE TRAILER. READINGS OUTSIDE THE TRAILER INDICATED NO ORGANIC VAPORS PRESENT AS MEASURED WITH A PID, AND NO LEL, CO, H2S, OR OXYGEN DEPLETION DETECTIONS INSIDE THE TRAILER, LEL, CO, O2 AND H2S LEVELS WERE NORMAL, WITH PID READING RANGING FROM 13-250 PPM UPON CLOSER INSPECTION OF THE CARGO, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE ELEVATED PID READING WERE DUE TO A BREACHED DRUM OF WASTE ACETONE WHICH HAD NOT SPILLED BUT WAS OPEN TO THE AIR, A TRANSFER TRACTOR-TRAILER WAS CONTRACTED THROUGH CLEAN HARBORS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES (CHES), KIMBALL NE. FOR OFFLOADING OF THE DRUMS FROM THE DAMAGED TRAILER FOR TRANSPORT TO THE RMCAT FACILITY IN DENVER. SINCE THE DAMAGED TRAILER WAS PARKED IN THE MEDIAN AND SOME OF THE DRUMS WOULD REQUIRE OVERPACKING, AND RMCAT TRUCK WAS POSITIONED AS AN INTERMEDIATE STAGING AREA AT THE REAR OF THE DAMAGED TRAILER FOR INSPECTION, CLEANING RELABELING, AND OVERPACKING OF THE DRUMS WITH A FORKLIFT BEFORE THEY WERE LOADED INTO THE CHES TRAILER. THE CARGO OF THE TRAILER CONSISTED OF VARIOUS TYPE ON NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE INCLUDING PALLETS OF TONER CARTRIDGES AND DRUM OF LIQUID WASTE, AND RCRA HAZARDOUS WASTES INCLUDING WASTE ACETONE, NITRIC ACID SOLUTIONS, FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS AND CORROSIVE LIQUIDS, AMONG OTHERS. IN TOTAL, NINETY-NINE DRUMS AND FIVE PALLETS OF TONER CARTRIDGES WERE TRANSPORTED ON THE SAVANNAH TRANSPORT TRAILER, TWO DRUMS LISTED ON MANIFEST #45281, GENERATED BY CHROMALLOY OF CARSON CITY, NV AS NON-RCRA HAZARDOUS WASTE, LIQUID (EVAPORATOR SLUDGE), WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE DRUMS WHICH HAD SPILLED THEIR CONTENTS INSIDE THE TRAILER.

NATURE  OF INCIDENT:  BENETO DRIVER WAS TRAVELING NORHTBOUND I-5 AT APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES PER  HOUR PULLING A SLIGHT GRADE.  AS HE PASSED THE TRANSITION ROAD FROM WESTBOUND 78 TO NORTHBOUND I-5 HE LOOKED IN HIS PASSENGER REAR-VIEW MIRROR AND SAW HEADLIGHTS RAPIDLY APPROACHING HIS VEHICLE (THE CAR WAS REPORTEDLY TRAVELING AT 60 TO 65 MPH).  IT WAS RAINING HEAVILY AND THE ONCOMING CAR SPUN OUT. AND HIT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE OUR SEMI-TRAILER AT THE OFFLOADING HEAD AREA.  THE CAR BOUNCED OFF AND THEN RAN INTO THE DIRT EMBANKMENT ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.  THE IMPACT OF THE COLLISION DAMAGED THE PLUMBING EXITING THE INTERNAL VALVES.  COMPARTMENT 2 PLUMBING WAS NEARLY SEVERED AT THE INTERNAL; COMPARTMENT 3 PLUMBING WAS BADLY DAMAGED.  ADDITIONALLY, THE IMPACT OF THE CAR PULLED OPEN 3 OF THE INTERNAL VALVES.  THE BENETO DRIVER PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND EXITED THE VEHICLE TO SURVEY THE DAMAGE.  PRODUCT WAS ESCAPING THE TRAILER; HE SAW THE THREE OPEN INTERNAL VALVES AND KICKED THEM CLOSED WITH HIS FOOT IMMEDIATELY REDUCING MOST OF THE PRODUCT FLOW.  AS SOME PRODUCT WAS STILL ESCAPING FROM THE #2 AND #3 INTERNALS HE YANKED AT THE INTERNAL CABLES AND FURTHER REDUCED THE FLOW.  HE PLACED BUCKETS UNDER THE LEAKING INTERNALS AND THEN CALLED 911.  HE FOLLOWED BY CALLING BENETO DISPATCH WHO IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED BILLY BROOKS, BENETO SAN DIEGO TERMINAL MANAGER, AND BILL MYERS, GENERAL MANAGER.  THE BENETO EMERGENCY RESPONSE VEHICLE WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SITE.  THE DRIVER THEN BEGAN PLACING HIS ABSORBENT TOWELS, AND GRANULATED ABSORBENT DAMNING THE PRODUCT FLOW FROM THE STORM DRAIN SOME 50 FEET SLIGHTLY DOWNHILL FROM THE TRUCK.  THE CHP ARRIVED AND THEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND CALTRANS.  CALTRANS NOTIFIED THE US COAST GUARD, THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE GROUP, AND OTHERS INCLUDING FOSS ENVIRONMENTAL.  BILLY BROOKS ARRIVED FOLLOWED BY BILL MYERS AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER BENETO'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE TRAILER.  THE FLOW HAD BEEN CONTAINED TO LEAKAGE INTO THE BUCKETS.  THE BUCKETS WERE PERIODICALLY EMPTIED INTO A DRUM PROVIDED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  WE WERE COLLECTING SOME 10 TO 15 GALLONS PER HOUR.  NO OTHER PRODUCT WAS BEING LOST.  WHEN OUR BENETO PUMP TRUCK ARRIVED THE TRANSFER OF PRODUCT FROM THE LEAKING COMPARTMENTS WAS BEGUN.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER OFFICIALS ON SITE WERE VERY COMPLIMENTARY ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE BENETO PERSONNEL WERE HANDLING THE LOSS AND PERMITTED BENETO TO HANDLE THE ENTIRE CLEANUP AND TRANSFER WITHOUT ASSISTANCE BEYOND STANDING BY IN CASE OF FIRE OR UNEXPECTED ADDITIONAL RELEASE.
