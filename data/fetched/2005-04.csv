In order to start the transfer the pressure has to be relieved from the trailer. When he opened the valve to release the pressure from the trailer, a mist of product came out of the release pipe that is elevated approx. 5 ft. and the wind blew it onto the front of the trailer and onto the back of the truck sleeper and the truck fenders. No product got on any individual. During the previous transfer the nitrogen tank that was used to blow the product line clean was empty and the air from the railcar was used to blow the line clean. The nitrogen tank gauge read that there was still pressure inside the tank.  When blowing product line clean, the valve on the platform side of air fitting was open allowing some product to enter the airline.  This valve is open when using nitrogen.",Root Cause(s):    1. Vendor’s gauge on the nitrogen tank failed on the previous transfer.  The tank read 320 lbs pressure when the tank was actually empty. (delivers @ 325 lbs)  a. Needing to clear the product line we used the air pressure from the railcar though we did not have the proper fittings.    b. The employee was not familiar with using air pressure from the railcar to clear the product line.    Corrective Action(s):    1. Communicate back to the nitrogen vendor the gauge failing to notify us of the tank being empty and what measures can be taken to prevent another gauge failure.  2. Compressed nitrogen stored as a back-up source. (verify with shipper)  3. Add additional pressure gauge to system on our side coming off the nitrogen bottle to determine the nitrogen tank level.  4.

While the product was being transferred, an elbow in the discharge pipe on top of the cargo tank began to leak. The transfer was terminated and air pressure was released from the cargo tank. The elbow was removed and replaced and the remainder of the product was transferred. Oil dry was placed around the cargo tank to contain the product and water that was used to neutralize the product. This was cleaned up by plant personnel for proper disposal.    The leak was a result of the rubber lining of the elbow having deteriorated to the point where the product began to contact the metal of the elbow. The corrosive nature of the product eventually caused a small hole to develop in the elbow.",The elbow was replaced with one having a different material for the lining.

The subject package toppled over onto its side as it was being placed, by hand, onto a wooden skid.  At this point, fumes were emitting from the box and the fiberboard box was getting wet from the contents leaking from inside.  The cargo warehouse was then evacuated & CHEMTREC was called.  CHEMTREC evaluated the HAZMAT information and advised that it was safe to return to the facility and carry out a self clean-up.  Approximately .3 liters leaked from the inner package. Most of this was absorbed by the packaging material & the remainder was soaked up by the fiberboard box itself.  T  The carto was opened & the inner package lid was resealed.

Memphis facility from Forward Air - Memphis with three radioactive containers of GE Nuclear equipment and three non-radioactive packages, all from Taiwan.  The three radioactive packages were labeled as Yellow III's with T.I.'s of 1.8, 2.0 and 6.4.  The truck did not have placards as required by DOT.  There were no shipping papers with the load indicating there was radioactive material being transported.  The dose rate in the cab of the truck was 2.8 mR/Hr.  The Tennessee Department of Radiological Health was notified and Duratek, Inc. Memphis obtained permission to accept the load and off-load the containers.  The containers were off-loaded and the highest 1-meter reading was 6 mR/Hr.    The trucking company (Accelerated, Inc.) does not have a Hazmat Registration and the driver was not qualified to haul Hazardous Material.

There was no release of hazardous material but there was an evacuation and road closure for two hours approximately in order to upright the truck.,"The company is having the brakes inspected and has a rollover prevention policy titled, ""SLIP OFF STAY OFF"" with cab posters and training reminders.  The idea is to bring the vehicle under control without attempting to radically change the path which can cause liquid load shifting and add to the potential for overturn. After each such accident a committee reviews the investigative facts to determine whether the driver followed company safety practices and whether disciplinary actions are appropriate.

Upon opening the rock to unload, the receiving attendant noticed that the batteries had shifted in the truck and on the pallets during uansportation. One battery was tilted at an angle and leaning against anather battery. The pallet was damaged. The driver acknowledged that the load had shifted violently when he made left turn.  While the chemical attendant was using the fork truck to push the battery to an upright position and moves it to an undamaged pallet, the battery tipped and fell on its side. Approximately one gallon of electrolyte leaked slowly from the battery vents.  The incident was reported using the on-site 3911 emergency number. The on-site spill response team arrived and applied neutralizer to the electrolyte that spilled out of the truck into the dock well. The fork truck was used to put the battery in a upright position. The trailer was moved a short distance from th.e dock. Thn resDonse team entered the truck, applied neutralizer, and used hoses to wash the interior of the trailer and the battery. The ninsate, tested and found to be neitral, was drained to the B/9016 containment vault and will be treated at the on-site industrial waste waler treatrntnt plant.  The battery was inspected and found not damaged. It was banded to a new pallet, placed back in the truck, secured and blocked to pre’ent shifting during transportation, and returned to the supplier.",The shipper and carrier were be reminded to properly secure the batteries to prevent movement during tranrportation.,No,BATTERY,battery for holding battery fluid,BATTERY,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,IBM DEPT 02A B/0962,US,

TWO JUGS WERE FOUND TO HAVE CAPS THAT HAD BEEN CROSS-THREADED OR NOT COMPLETELY FASTENED.  THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRUCKS HAD CAUSED THE PAINT THINNER TO SPILL THROUGH THE LOOSE CAPS.  THE LIDS ON THE TWO CONTAINERS WERE RE-FASTENED SO NO MORE MARKING WOULD OCCUR.  THE REST OF THE CARGO WAS INSPECTED AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND.  THERE WERE NO FREE LQIUIDS ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER OR ON THE ASPHALT DUE TO THE RAPID EVAPORATION RATE OF PAINT THINNER.

Box 38,OAKLAND,CA,94621,Other-contractor,"Email from Employee about that night     Dave,     On the night of 04/30/05, a ms. Louise Taylor, employee of Alaska Airlines since 01/05/99, tendered a shipment of household goods comprised largely of printed matters and folded up boxes.  When she arrived, I was on the phone with a customer and so had Kristian get a weight and piece count of the shipment.  When i finished on the phone, I helped him to count, weigh, inspect, and get the dimensions of all forty-seven pieces.  We inspected twenty percent of the shipment (ten pieces) and everything seemed fine.  It wasn't until after the customer left, while I was affixing lot labels to the boxes, that I noticed the words ""cleaning supplies"" and ""matches"" written on the side of one box.  Knowing that ""cleaning supplies"" is a trigger term for possibly undisclosed dangerous goods and that matches are not allowed on passenger aircrafts unless safety matches, I felt it necessary to open the box for further inspection.  Upon opening it, I discovered cleaning agents in compressed aerosol cans, hygrogen peroxide, bug spray, laundry detergent etc. and matches.  I knew that such things are not allowed to be shipped as cargo unless all precautions are taken to properly ship them as dangerous goods and indeed this is not the case. Being my first time dealing with undisclosed dangerous goods discovered after the customer has departed, I perused the IATA handbook for several of the chemicals discovered and realized they certainly are not acceptable for transport in the condition tendered.  For guidance in this particular situation, I turned to Maria who happened to be in the cargo facility at the moment.  She informed me that this could be a very big deal requiring the invovlement of the TSA and FAA.  It was at this moment that you called and I informed you of the situation.     As instructed, I telephoned the customer to let her know that the box was unacceptable for transport.  Unfortunately, I misspoke and told her we could also dispose of it with her approval.  When i learned that this is in fact untrue, I called her back and told her she would have to come back to take the package and watch us inspect each piece in the rest of her shipment.  She politely expressed her unwillingness to return and I informed her that it would be much easier on all involved if she could make the time.  I continued to explain that if she did not, the issue could become much larger and we may be forced to contact the TSA and FAA regarding the discovery of undisclosed dangerous goods.  She very calmly told me to do what we must.",All agents have been asked to start looking more closely at the writing on the boxes to look for trigger items wrote on boxes    Alaska Station Manager and Supervisors where let know at the frist point and have been aware the everything we have done,No,BOX,"Box, wood or fiberboard not specified",BOX,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Delta Global Service,US,

Flight control advised passenger Sally Mixon, Seat 22D was in possession of a liquid oxygen container.    Flight 1219 arrived at gate B-1 at 1510 hours and Station Manager Carla Sutera and Performance Leader Tim Manning met the flight.  After coordination with flight control, Carla Sutera briefed with the Captain/Co-Pilot and advised the passenger would be removed from the aircraft and the flight would depart ASAP.  The aircraft departed 21 minutes later at 1531.    Sally Mixon was traveling with her 11 year old son, Rashawn Mixon and both parties were removed from the flight.  Carla Sutera met with Ms. Mixon in the B-1 gatehouse.  AFSD/TSA Elizabeth Borreson arrived and spoke with the passenger as well.   FAA did not respond, but was in contact with Dangerous Goods Management Stephanie Horwitz. FAA Louis Fernandez called the RIC station at 0825, April 26th and advised he would be out at 1330 hours to obtain the contact information and view the unit.     Carla Sutera received a verbal statement from Ms. Mixon:  Ms. Mixon advised she has numerous medical problems and requires the oxygen on a limited basis when walking.  She had traveled from HSV-ATL-BDL on April 23, 2005 to attend a fund raiser in BDL.  The Oxygen Container was taken on the previous trip with no incident.  Upon departing BDL, Ms. Mixon did not advise anyone she was in possession of the Oxygen.  Ms. Mixon stated that while going through the checkpoint in BDL, they identified the oxygen container, checked it out and allowed her to transit the security checkpoint.      Ms. Mixon boarded the aircraft and before departure, the flight attendant identified the item, which was believed initially to be an oxygen concentrator, and advised her she would need to put it in the overhead bin.  Before departure the flight attendant came back to her and advised her she would need to hold the unit, which she did for takeoff.  Between pushback and takeoff, Ms. Mixon advised the cabin felt stuffy and she proceeded to use the unit on board the aircraft.  After takeoff, Ms. Mixon said the flight attendant came back with her manual and said the item was not allowed.  Shortly after this, the flight diverted.     Flight attendant initially believed the device was an oxygen concentrator.  Oxygen concentrators may be transported but not used during flight.  As soon as Flight attendant realized the unit was possibly a Liquid Oxygen device instead of an oxygen concentrator, the passenger was questioned.  After recieving confirmation of liquid oxygen, flight attendant contacted captain and diversion scenario was initiated.     The unit was a Puritan Bennett, Helios 300 portable liquid oxygen container which is 3/4 full. Photo's of the unit are attached.     Ms. Mixon was very gracious and polite during the interview and several times indicated she had traveled with this unit on previous trips and she had no idea the unit was not allowed.      Ms. Mixo","Delta policy was reiterated to appropriate business units.  Information provided to passengers on delta.com was reviewed and enhanced as appropriate.
