A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder immediately inspected NATX 303984. The responder reported intact seal NDPS 011002 removed from valve housing cover to inspect valves and fittings. The sample port valve appeared to be the source of the product release. A severe thunderstorm in the area caused the responder to dismount the tank car, postponing final securement activities. NATX 303984 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard. On 11/02/2010, contract responders completed securement by closing the sample port valve 2 1/2 turns. The sample valve's closure plug was only hand tight. The plug was removed, cleaned, plug threads Teflon taped and reapplied securely. The contractors cleaned the spillage inside the valve housing area and the sides of NATX 303984 with a soap solution and a pressurized water rinse. Rinsing liquids were captured by plastic tarping that was placed under NATX 303984. Afterwards, BNSF seal 1299 was applied onto the valve housing cover.

CSXT  dispatched an emergency response contractor, Eagle/SWS. Eagle/SWS personnel advised product was noted on both sides of the manway nozzle/cover but was rapidly evaporating. They reported two of eight manway cover bolts were less than tool tight and tightened these bolts. CSXT moved UTLX 202676 to and from and liquid leak was noted at the interface of the manway cover and manway nozzle near the manway cover safety bolts. At 08:33 T. J. Mannas, Mgr.-HazMat, CSXT inspected UTLX 202676 with Eagle/SWS personnel. Seal ""SUNCOR028404"" was intact on the manway cover. The manway cover gasket was inspected. At 09:10 T. J. Mannas contacted Mr. E. Patterson (610-246-0843), Sunoco R+M, Philadelphia, PA. Mr. Patterson advised he would dispatch personnel from Union Tank Car Company, Oregon, OH to replace manway cover gakset with Durlon 9000 (present gasket same material). At 11:25 Mr. Ray Spencer, Supervisor-Field Operations, Union Tank Car Company, Oregon, OH (419-698-3820) and his personnel replaced the manway cover gasket. CSXT moved the tank car to and from and a liquid leak was noted at the interface of the manway cover and manway nozzle near the manway cover safety bolts. Union Tank Car Company personnel further tighened the manway cover bolts and repositioned the manway cover on its nozzle but to no avail. Mr. Spencer advised the leak was due to a ""warped manway cover."" Mr. Patterson was advised of this. Mr. Patterson advised he would furnish a tank car to accomplish transfer of UTLX 202676. UTLX 202676 was switched to an isolated track pending transfer.    A special switching move was required for this incident.  A QA 7.1 Non conformance report is not required for this incident.

Yard crew detected and reported odor to tower. Carl Unddenberg investigated and found no odor adjacent to the car, on the ground by the ladder, but reports later came in from another yard crew reporting odor again.  KCS hazmat notified mobilized Specialized Response Solutions for safety qualified response. The Louisiana State Police was notified per state requirement. Also, notification to shipper has been completed through Chemtrec. The hazmat response team arrived at 7:30 a.m 11/14/10. The packing gland nut on the B-End liquid line of the tank car was tighten about  turn to stop the small leak. No other leaks was found of the tank car.    Note to report, item 27, amount in package, was estimated by preparer. This action was required to facilitate data acceptance by defective DOT IT system edits. Specifically, this estimated quantity was required: (1)because the shippers only provided bulk quantities on shipping paper, as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements; and (2)because the DOT e-system requires data in this field to facilitate report acceptance.     KCS emergency mitigation services were activated to provide for special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, dedicated internal management oversight, train/yard crew delay, and regulatory reporting as appropriate.  KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 may apply as services require.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.",No,TANK CAR,Pressure,105JW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7000,Kansas City Southern Railroad,US,

This action was to facilitate data acceptance by defective DOT IT system edits. Specifically, this estimated quantity was required: (1)because the shippers only provided bulk quantities on shipping paper, as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements; and (2)because the DOT e-system requires data in this field, using same units of measure as found in the capacity field, to facilitate report acceptance. KCS will continue to report in this fashion unit instructed differently by DOT or PHMSA.

Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

CHEMTREC was notified and a team from Eagle SWS Progressive Environmental company cleaned the spill.","• It has been determined that the cause of the damage was one nail coming out from a wooden skid that punctured the bottom of the plastic jerrican. All relevant staff has been notified of the discrepancy and made aware that a such build up condition developed this situation. Standard Operating Procedures for handling staff have been reviewed. There has been some additional recommendations, included but not limited to:  Use only wood (skids or boards) that have been carefully inspected for nails or damaging objects.  Avoid the use of ""inverted"" skids unless other forms of build up are inappropriate.  The findings of this event should be disseminated through build up/loading staff worldwide. The training department should make reference to this event into the training program.  The auditing and DG team should check for build up process involving this practice and discuss accordingly.",No,JERRICAN,Non-removable head plastic jerrican,3H1,No,,,,ZZ,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3693,ATLAS AIR INC.,US,

The drums are typically placed directly on the floor of the truck. During the loading process and unbeknownst to the forklift operator at the time, one drum was set on top of a loose bolt inside the truck. The affected drum received a small puncture (1/8 inch) to the bottom edge of the drum.It is unclear as to the exact time the leak started, but shortly after the driver left the facility, he stopped on thes outhbound shoulder of US highway 61 approximately 7 miles south of Winona, MN. During this stop, the driver performed a vehicle check and noticed that there was a small amount of material leaking out of the side of his trailer.The driver estimated that approximately 1 quart or 3 Ibs of material had dripped onto the shoulder of the highway.The material is thick and viscous and did not run off of the asphalt roadway.The driver waited until the leak appeared to stop and attempted to cover the material with ""oil-dry"" and then proceeded to return to the facility where he picked the load up from. The driver contacted the facility to describe the incident. It was at this point the Safety, Health,& Environmental manager was notified and he proceeded to make the regulatory notifications of the hazardous waste release to the Minnesota Duty Officer. After returning to the facility the truck was unloaded to determine which drum or package had leaked. When the leaking drum was identified, it was apparent that only a small amount of waste material had escaped from the drum.The damaged drum was removed from the manifest and was later repackaged at the facility for shipment to an appropriate TSDF at a later date.","On the facility end, we will be developing a pre-shipment checklist for our folks to go through each time they make a hazardous waste shipment. Part of that checklist will be to perform an inspection of the truck/trailer to ensure that it is in good condition and that the truck/trailer itself does not pose any hazards while loading the waste materials.",No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CYTEC ENGINEERED MATERIALS,US,

The identified BNSF train was stopped on main track after the BNSF train crew was alerted of a possible leaking tank car in their train. After train inspection, the train crew reported entrained CGTX 30444 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) with product wetness on its side shell. CGTX 30444 was carefully set out of the train at a nearby transfer track. A BNSF responder assisted by the local F.D. reported that inspection of CGTX 30444 revealed that the liquid valve was in the full open position and this valve's closure plug was not applied. This condition allowed product to escape from the open orifice at the liquid valve during rail movement. The valve was closed and its closure plug was applied and tool tightened. Securement was completed by 1510 hrs. CDT, 11/02/2010. The F.D. responders applied oil absorbent on all observed impacted ground areas. An environmental contractor captured product dripping off the side shell of CGTX 30444 and cleaned spillage from its side shell and side ladders. Additional remediation of ground impact areas was accomplished. Captured spillage and spent cleaning supplies were earmarked for appropriate disposal.     On 11/11/2010 inspection of CGTX 30444 at the BNSF railyard in Temple, TX revealed that the liquid valve may be leaking again. A BNSF responder aided by contract responders inspected CGTX 30444. Inspection revealed that the liquid valve's flange bolts were loose and a small leak was detected at the ball valve/flange threaded connection. The responders removed the valve, cleaned and applied sealant to the threaded areas. Gasket material was applied to the flange plate and the flange bolts were tool tightened.  The valve was reinserted and properly tool tightened. Afterwards, no further evidence of product leakage was detectable.  FRA Movement Approval FRA-10110785 was granted to continue transport of CGTX 30444 to its destination for unloading and then leak proof pressure testing of CGTX 30444.  CGTX 30444 arrived at its destination for unloading on 11/23/2010 without further incident.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7950,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The identified BNSF train was stopped on main track at station Tangier for crew inspection. The train crew reported entrained TILX 193983 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) was leaking product from its bottom outlet valve (BOV). BNSF and response contractors inspected TILX 193983 and reported that the bottom operated BOV operating handle was not pinned in the closed position and the bottom outlet cap (BOC) was not applied and was hanging from its securement chain. The responders closed the BOV operating handle and wedged a wooden shim to secure it in the closed position which ended any further product release. The BOC was applied and tool tightened. The unpinned BOV operating handle allowed it to vibrate to an open position and with no BOC in place to contain product resulted in this product release from the BOV. Two other entrained tank cars were also noted with their BOC's not applied and hanging from their securement chains with no product leaks detected; responders applied these BOC's and tool tightened them. This BNSF train was reinspected by BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders upon its arrival at Amarillo, TX. Responders resecured the BOV bottom operating handle on TILX 193983 by pinning it with a bolt/nut application in its closed position. Remediation of spillage at the main track train stop location was initiated after the rain events in that area ceased. Responders remediated spillage by soil aeration with applications of Micro-Blaze. Also, previous sites were entrained TILX 193983 may have leaked product on the ground were inspected and no evidence of product spillage was noted.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,31000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Star Transport, LLC made a delivery of gasoline to the Shop N Mart at 5008 Aldine Bender in Houston, Texas.  Immediately following the delivery, a gasoline leak was discovered from the port hole on the UST at the fueling station.  An unknown third party utilized water to wash the affected surface, which resulted in the impact to a nearby storm drain.  The Harris County Public Health Department and Houston City Fire Department were contacted to respond.  Upon arrival on site, the Houston FD applied foam to the affected surface.  It was reported that approximately 50-100 gallons of gasoline had been released.  However, later determined that approximately 5% gasoline, 95% water were observed.  Garner Environmental Services, Inc. of Deer Park, Texas was dispatched by Star Transport, LLC. to perform the cleanup.  Upon inspection of the site, it was confirmed to be 95% water solution, which had impacted the storm drain. Absorbent material was applied to the asphalt surface and Garner Environmental Services, Inc. proceeded to flush the storm sewer system to remove residual product from the storm drain, while collecting wash water at the outfall.  Two (2), 55-gallon drums of spent absorbents and approximately 300 gallons of wash water, were generated during the cleanup.  Garner Environmental Services, Inc. will coordinate disposal in accordance with local, state and federal regulations.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be the result of an overflow while offloading, due to a gauge miscalculation, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

Godney of a report of an ammonia smell in the vicinity of car #PLMX 135275 in track# BC38. I subsequently proceeded to track #38 and checked car with Ammonia test paper via inspection ports confirming the presence of ammonia. Upon opening the protective housing cover which was not sealed, I determined the source of leak was emanating from the Pressure Relief Device (PRD) and subsequent check of pressure in residual car indicated a reading between 58-59 p.s.i. Car was susequently re-located to old rip track area in the south end of the yard to minimize any impact to the public and/or employees.    Hazmat contractor ""Midwest Environmental"" was contacted and requested to respond to scene after being advised of the defective PRD. Upon arrival of 'Midwest Environmental"" who also confirmed leak we again attempted to align the O-Ring and O-Ring retainer with negative reults.    Supplier ""Transammonia"" was contacted and advised of the leak in the PRD. Supplier indicated that they could not supply for any transfer.    Do the the railcar's location in a densely populated area (Chicago Metro) and car pressure of 58-59 p.s.i. We made the following determination to degas the car based on the risk of prevailing winds in the area. While waiting for tranfer pump and deionized waster tanker to transfer vapors and any remaining product, personnel attended the car until arrival of equipment.    At 2000, CDT, 11-12-1010, degassing of car was completed and Aqueous Ammonia that was produced as a result of the transfer was taken to a nearby ammonia plant for handling. New 'Midland' O-rings and O-rings retainer were installed on PRD. Estimated volume of ammonia transferred equated to Aqua Ammonia trailer filled to 55% (7000 gallons max)with deionized water. Float rose 2% after gas went into water = 140 gallons at 5.2 lbs. per gallon (52 degrees F) equating to approximately 728 lbs of ammonia.    On 11-12-2010, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Inspectors A. Monroe and E. Monroe arrived on scene and were supplied requested information in regards to this Non-Accidental Release (NAR) involving this car.    Car is currently isolated in yard awaiting FRA movement approval from supplier.

Upon subsequent inspection in Univar facility, box had developed a small leak on one corner of the box.  Leakage was cleaned using floor dry material, and box was overpackaged into a supersack, which also leaked material.  The container was moved to a containment pallet, pending arrival of emergency response contractor.  An emergency response company was contracted to re-package the material (including original packaging, and clean up materials) into drums.  The drums were then sent for disposal.    The cause of the failure was the presence of a small amount of free liquids within the packaged material.  The original container was not damamged; however, the liquids were released through the fiberboard box.","Univar drivers will continue to inspect waste containers before pickup from custoemr and transported.

Further investigation found that valve hanlde assembly had been damaged at some point and the valve handle was bent and the safety pin was out of the handle.  car was found on an inbound inspection.  Car was moved from train yard to customer track and placed over containment pans with bucket under bottom outlet and a pipe wrench was used to tighten the bottom outlet cap stopping the leak.   Also used pipe wrench to turn valve stem to be sure valve was closed.  Rail car repair company called and they repaired the valve handle and the car was unloaded. after repair valve operated as intended but customer sent car to repasir shop.,this looks like damage to the valve handle occurred in transit and not shure how the valve handle was bent. Shipper had proper documentation of pre and post load inspections and leak was so small as it was hard to see. the valve handle being bent and safety pin out may have been observed by originating rail carrier at some other inspection point.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Central California Traction Company,US,

MARK STATED TO SCOTT THAT HE WAS DELIVERING GAS TO A CUSTOMER AND SAW GAS COMING OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF HIS TRUCK.  MARK HIT HIS REMOTE EMERGENCY STOP, BUT THE GAS STILL COMING OUT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TRUCK PIPING.  MARK WAS DELIVERING GAS TO A COMPANY THAT DOES WELDING, SO MARK REELED HIS HOSE IN AND MOVED THE CTMV A BLCOK AWAY TO A SAFER LOCATION.  MARK AGAIN HIT HIS REMOTE EMERGENCY STOP AND THE GAS WAS STILL COMING OUT.  MARK CALLED OUR OFFICE AND OUR SERVICE MANAGER, SQUIRE MUNCY AND ANOTHER DRIVER WENT TO THE SCENE.  SCOTT CALLED STEVE KRUTSINGER OF KURTSINDER SERVICE INC., A TAMPA BASED BUSINESS THAT BUILDS BULK TRUCKS.  STEVE HAD BUILT THIS TRUCK FOR OUR COMPANY IN 2002.  SCOTT EXPLAINED TO STEVE THE SITUATION THAT WE HAD A TRUCK THAT WAS LEAKING PROPANE.  UPON ARRIVAL ON THE SCENE THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD SECURED A ONE BLOCK AREA IN EVERY DIRECTION.  BY THIS TIME THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD TWO LARGE HOSES SPRAYING WATER ON THE BULK  TRUCK IN A FOG TYPE PATTERN.  SCOTT ASKED THE FIRE DEPT. IF HE COULD APPROACH THE TRUCK TO BETTER EVALUATE THE SITUATION, AND THEY STATED NO, NOT AT THIS TIME.  SCOTT DISCUSSED HOW TO REMEDY THE SITUATION AND STOP THE LEAK.  STEVE SAID THE PIPING AND THE DELIVERY HOSE NEEDED TO BE DRAINED IN ORDER FOR THE LEAK TO COMPLETELY STOP.  SCOTT INSTRUCTED A FIREMAN ON HOW TO OPEN THE VALVE ON THE DELIVERY HOSE AND DRAIN THE GAS OUT OF THE HOSE AND TRUCK PIPING.  STEVE WENT TO HIS TRUCK AND GOT A GLOBE VALVE TO ATTACH TO THE END OF OUR NOZZLE ON THE DELIVERY HOSE.  THIS ALLOWS A CONTROLLED RELEASE OF PROPANE.  THE FIREMAN TOOK THE DELIVERY HOSE BACK INTO THE WATER FOG, SO WHEN HE RELEASED IT, IT WOULD DISSIPATE.  THE FIREMAN OPENED THE GLOBE VALVE ALLOWING THE GAS TO GO FROM LIQUID TO VAPOR.  ONCE THAT HAPPENDED, THEY TURNED OFF THE WATER HOSES THAT HAD BEEN FOGGING THE TRUCK, AND THE LEAK HAD STOPPED.

The storage tank didn’t have a sight glass or monitor to measure how full it was.  Plant operator uses a ladder to look inside the dome of the tank.  The dome is also used to vent the tank.  The driver had understood that the plant operator would be monitoring the level.  Driver said he closed valves and went inside to see how full it was.  He said the product had splashed/bubbled out of dome as tank was being filled.  About 1 gallon on the floor.   Operator told driver he was using too much air pressure.  Driver went back to continue the unload by just cracking the valve on the trailer a little bit.  While the rest of the unload took place, 2 plant operators were cleaning up the one gallon spill.  When the line went empty, a mist was forced out the dome into the area by the plant operators.  One immediately went outside to vomit.  The other went to close a door so it wouldn’t get into the plant.  Both men went to the hospital to be checked out.  The one that vomited was released.  The other one was kept overnight as a precaution and to do some breathing tests. He was released the next morning and we have no further details.",The driver did partially close his valve to prevent splattering out of the storage tank but he should also have reduced the air pressure.

Covering loader walked the rack and gauged each tank car level and continued to load the railcars.While loading CBO, on car GATX 24665 the loading arm extension sleeve that directs the flow into the top of the railcar came unhooked and dropped down about 7 inches. This caused a gap between the loading arm and the extension. The cause of the sleeve becoming unhooked from the loading arm was due to extreme high winds and vibration. The gap between the loading arm and the extension coupled with the extreme high winds caused the CBO to blow outside of the extension onto the top and along the sides of the railcar. Loader noticed the CBO flowing from the top of the extension and immediately blocked the product valve to loading spot. Loader then immediatley notified his supervisor, lead loader, and original loader about the incident.",Come up with a system that will be safer in all weather conditions.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Western Refining,US,

Once the driver called 911 he then called the office to notify us of the accident.  The office notified the appropriate authorities.  The second driver and the local fire department determined that there was a samll crack that was leaking near the front of the trailer and they plugged it to stop as much as possible and also contained the product that had spilled.  They then pumped out the compartment to stop the leak completely. Once the tank was empty the wrecker uprighted the truck and pulled out the tanker.

There were two (2) roll-off boxes containing the same material that were being loaded at different times at the Heritage Transport, LLC 10-Day facility.  The first box was being loaded onto the truck and the driver observed material was spilling from the tailgate of the roll-off box.  He retuned the roll-off box to the ground, contacted a supervisor to look at the box and assisted with the loading of the box onto the truck.  During the loading process the box released some material.  Once the box was on the truck the material ceased leaking from the box and the box was transported to Heritage-WTI, Inc. for treatment.  At that time spill pads and vermiculite were placed on the affected area.  The second box was visually inspected for free liquids and it was determined by supervisory staff that there were none, and the roll-off box could be loaded onto the truck. When the second box was loaded onto the trailer, material began to leak from the tailgate in a manner similar to the initial roll-off box.  The roll-off box was loaded onto the truck and the material once again ceased to leak and the box was transported to Heritage-WTI, Inc.  Spill pads and vermiculite were placed on the affected area.  A total of approximately 10 gallons of material was released from the two (2) roll-off boxes.  The material in both boxes was: UN3077, WASTE ENVIRONMENTALLY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES, SOLID, N.O.S., 9, PO III, (F037, F038).  Emergency response and clean-up was handled by the Field Services group from Heritage-WTI, Inc.  Response efforts included vacuuming accumulated stormwater and spilled liquids and excavating gravel in the affected areas.  All materials were properly disposed of at Heritage-WTI, Inc.

TONY BARNETT,RISK/ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER,,,,,Carrier,"I would like to assure you this spill was not a discharge to the waters of the United States. This discharge was caused by a motor vehicle accident which caused our tanker to be overturned and a spill to accumulate in a roadside field which was dry prior the accident. The spill was contained via berms and dikes until it could be removed and properly disposed of the same day.  This product PG76-22 (Petroleum Asphalt Liquid), is used as a binding agent in the manufacturing of commonly used hot mix asphalt. This hot mix asphalt is prominent in most highways, roadways and parking lots in the United States. The product is only considered as a hazardous material because of its elevated temperature of 380 degrees Fahrenheit during its transit. Therefore, it must be placarded as “3257 HOT” (Elevated temperature liquid, n.o.s., at or above 100 C and below its flash point (including molten metals, molten salts, etc.).  The discharge occurred because of a motor vehicle accident. On November 11th 2010 at approximately 7:05 am, our tanker truck was Northbound on Hwy 11 in Etowah County, when a work van pulled out onto the roadway and hit the left front of the truck causing damage to the steering which would not allow our driver (Michael Page) to correct the roll effect of the accident, thus caused the tanker truck to overturn. Our driver was able to remove himself from the overturned vehicle within the next couple of minutes after the accident. Upon inspection, Mr. Page noticed the tanker leaking product from the fill lid and reported this to our Transportation Supervisor, Phillip Ray. The discharge occurred in the vicinity of 34-09.225N & 85-57.236W. The damage to the tanker allowed the fill port to become unsealed and the PG76-22 product to escape through the opening.  At approximately 7:15 am, I directed Michael Knight to dike the area with a virgin Limestone aggregate to eliminate the spread of the product in the affected area. This eliminated the spread of the hot liquid. The spilled PG76-22 product was allowed to cool for proper handling, where by, heavy equipment was brought in to accommodate the removal of the spilled product. Large amounts of virgin Limestone aggregate (8910), was brought onsite to incorporate with the product for better handling. It was then removed from the site and taken to our plant location and stored for future use in the production of hot mix asphalt.The removal was completed at approximately 1500 hrs for a duration of approximately 8 hours.","This was a motor vehicle accident which was caused by a third party outside of the control of Good Hope Contracting Co., Inc. and is considered to be a non-preventable accident from our Company’s standpoint. However, the environmental impact was mitigated to a minor event, with no lasting impact on the environment.    I have cautioned the drivers of our tankers to be careful with people which are waiting to pull onto the roadway from an adjacent driveway.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,121629,,,

The nurse tank valve was turned into the ""on"" or ""open"" position due to the roll.  This caused the anhydrous ammonia to be released into the atmosphere.  The driver removed himself from the hazardous situation and contacted local law enforcement and local fire department for assistance.  No additional mitigation efforts were made as the entire product was released before an apporpriate HAZMAT could arrive.  The driver conducted himself appropriately to remove himself from the immediate hazard and contact authorities.  The duration of the release was approximately 1 hour.","Incident has been used by River Valley Cooperative to illustrate the need for use of safe driving techniques when transporting hazardous materials.  In addition, the company will use the incident to confirm the driver's safe and appropriate actions when dealing with an anhydrous ammonia release.
