During the course of the loading maneuver, the driver and a customer representative discovered a small amount of material coming from the rear door seal of the roll off bin container leaking onto the containment site from which the box was being loaded. Due to previous inclement weather in the area, material inside the roll off bin became saturated. Subsequently, the ground around the roll off bin and the containment device were also saturated, causing the containment device to become fragile and tear as the roll off bin was hoisted atop the roll off truck frame rails. This caused approximately one solid pound of material to make contact with the earth underneath. The driver immediately placed a containment pail under the rear door. The customer representative contacted his dispatcher to request a response crew. Upon notification, the customer’s response crew was summoned, donned the appropriate personal protective equipment, removed the released material and placed it into a 55 gallon drum to be disposed of onsite, tightened the rear door which stopped the leak: a containment diaper was secured to the roll off bin as an added measure. The shipment continued on to the disposal destination.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking or damage was observed. Upon inspection at the Clean Harbors’ La Porte, TX facility, it was determined the roll off bin was leaking due to the presence of free liquid. In order to prevent a recurrence, the customer facility has been instructed to immediately notify Clean Harbors once a bin has been loaded in order to expedite the transportation and disposal process. The driver has been re-instructed to perform a comprehensive inspection of the container's body along with the closure device to identify any potential issues before transportation.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"CLEAN HARBORS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.",US,

The release was cleaned and all impacted absorbent pads were placed inside (1) 30-gallon poly drum. The waste was left onsite in OS&D for the terminal to manage. The contractor stated that the manufacturer would need to send a new tote for the product to be shipped on. So the contractor then created a containment area around the tote so it could be staged there while waiting to be transferred. At this time, the new tote has been shipped to the terminal.

The head space had the potential to generate moisture (condensate) due to temp changes. The styrene would have reacted with the moisture. Once the drum was put on the truck and “agitated” the reaction stared again. At least this is my hypothesis.   The client describes the waste stream as “stabilized.” In our vocabulary that means that the monomer has been inhibited which would prevent the reaction from continuing. The client used the word to mean that the reaction had ended. Nothing had been added (inhibitor) to cease the reaction.

When I came out to inspect, I found that there was vapor leaking from the valve plug on  the vapor valve.  I checked to see if the valve was tight and it was not.  I tightened the valve handle  and the leak stopped.  The plug was not even close to hand tight so I properly tightened it. I checked the liquid valve plugs and they were not hand tight either so I tightened them also.  I  removed Seal #4979273 from the protective housing lid and the installed new seal #971751 and then  released the car for service.

The contractor confirmed the valve was tightened and secured to continue transport. The impacted concrete was neutralized with citric acid then solidified with pads.

Package was placed in a black tote and brought to QA for inspection. When the package was opened it contained a 5 gallon drum on Paint with a UN # 1263 and Flammable Liquid 3 stickers. The drum had a very small amount of dried white paint coming from the pull out spout in the top on its lid. The spout/valve seemed to have been slightly jarred from its original position. The drum was dented in several places and it is suspected that one these impacts may have jarred the valve. No packing material was around the drum inside of its cardboard box. Because the paint was dried when discovered it is believed that the damage likely occurred during transit.

The FRA inspectors noticed the car was placard UN1486. 5.1, they then went to the yardmaster for waybill information which showed car as an empty NON HAZ. NS then tracked down shipper to verify if this car should be a placarded last contained rail car or if waybill information was incorrect. It was determined Waybill info was incorrect and car should have a hazmat waybill. An NS approved contractor was notified to clean off the top of the car and verify was indeed empty which it was.  The material on the car was not the result of a release during transit but a car loading/unloading issue. Shipper contacted NS billing department to input correct billing for the car prior to movement.

Veolia also reviewed the incident and talked about ways to avoid similar incidents in the  future.  The employee was also working in a very tight/restricted area due to the truck being loaded with material from their previous stop.  The tight space and employee's experience level were  contributing factors to the incident. The pallet jack was inspected following the incident.

Driver alerted our 24/7 Dispatch team of the release who coordinated with the incident commander to have NRC Environmental Services dispatched out to the site, alert local authorities, and complete notification to the National Response Center.","The involved driver was terminated due to the severity of the incident and blatant disregard for company policy and proper procedures. In order to prevent recurrence, other drivers went through refresher training to remind them of proper loading/ unloading procedures and company policy regarding safe operation of a CMV.

A very small amount of the contents had leaked out of the box, and a manager quickly placed it in a plastic Hazmat salvage container to prevent a spill. Upon inspection, it was found that the inner package (metal pail) suffered a large dent on the edge near the lid. It appears that this was caused by an impact in handling - possibly by falling off the load side rollers when waiting to be loaded onto trailer. The dent had allowed lacquer to be released, but the overpack was able to contain almost all of it inside. Once inside the salvage container, the contents slowly started flowing through the closure of the box but all released contents were contained by salvage bucket.  Metal pail has been placed in a large salvage drum along with the wet damaged fiberboard overbox. Leaked remains that were caught by plastic container was placed in a second salvage drum.

Our driver was present at the pump cabinet at the time of the rupture disk failure, and was accompanied by 2 customer operators. Based on the fact the pressure safety valve (set at 40 psig) never lifted. It appears the rupture disc (with a burst rating of 65.8 psig) was faulty and burst prematurely.  After the pressure decreased and was under control, our driver was able to safely and successfully transfer product into the customer trailer.",The NA Fleet team began a program in 2012 for atmospheric trailers to convert from a rupture disk/safety valve system to a safety valve only relief system.

Halfway through unloading, driver noticed a small leak developing at the hose connection to the customer tank.  Recognizing the leak, the driver  began the process to shut down the fill.  Driver closed the trycock valve and turned to proceed toward trailer to shut it down as well.  When driver turned toward trailer, he noticed the leak rapidly accelerating  and he made a quick move to get away.  At this same time, the leak ignited.  Driver quickly got back to trailer and shut down the delivery.  With the pump down and the trailer side isolated, the fire slowed significantly, but was still burning, likely due to standing liquid in the hose. After taking a moment to assess the situation, he was able to safely close the top fill valve at the tank, fully isolating the hose on both sides.  Driver promptly notified customer and emergency services for response.  Driver completed a helium purge and disconnected the hose under emergency services supervision. It is estimated that the fire lasted ~15-20 minutes.  During investigation, it was found that the customer tank hose seal was not per design specification.",Check male fitting design bayonet specifications to drawings on all similar tanks in service.  This tank was already corrected following the incident.  Transfer hose and fittings (tank and hose) were sent to manufacturer for further investigation.

DRIVER, OUT OF OUR PITTSBURGH FACILITY, LEFT THE FACILITY AND WAS DRIVING NORTH ON ROUTE 522 ON HIS WAY TO MCVEYTOWN, PA WHEN IT STARTED TO SNOW. THE SNOW CAME DOWN HARD COVERING THE ROAD WITH IN 5 MINUTES OF SNOWING. THE BOX TRUCK THAT OUR DRIVER WAS USING HAD 2 DIFFERENT TREAD TYPES ON ITS REAR WHEELS. ONE TIRE HAD ""ALL WEATHER TREAD' AND ONE TIRE HAD ""HIGHWAY TREAD"".  THE TIRES WERE WITHIN DOT COMPLIANCE. THE TRUCK WAS ALSO CARRYING A LIGHT LOAD. THE DRIVER SLOWED DOWN TO 40 MPH, SLOWER THAN THE 55 MPH SPEED LIMIT BUT STILL LOST CONTROL OF THE TRUCK. THE TRUCK VEERED OFF INTO A DITCH ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD. IT CAME TO A HALT IN THE DITCH AND WAS ON A 45 DEGREE ANGLE. THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE TRUCK WITHOUT INJURY. THE SECURED LOAD OF 5 PALLETS DID SHIFT AND CAME UNDONE INSIDE THE TRUCK. THE LEAD ACID BATTERIES WERE ON THEIR SIDE AND UPSIDE DOWN, WITH ACID LEAKING OUT OF THEM. THE SNOW WAS COMING DOWN. THE STATE POLICE, CLINTON COUNTY HAZMAT TEAM, MIFFLIN COUNTY EMA, AND PENN DOT ARRIVED AT THE SCENE. DUE TO THE SNOWY HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS, PENN DOT DIRECTED THAT THE RECOVERY AND CLEAN UP COMPANY COM BACK TOMORROW WHEN CONDITIONS ARE BETTER. THE TOWING/CLEAN UP COMPANY WAS TOLD TO CALL PENN DOT FIRST TO MAKE SURE THAT CONDITIONS WERE SAFE ENOUGH FOR CLEAN UP TOMORROW.  THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TOWING COMPANY AND EMA ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AFTER GETTING PERMISSION FROM PENN DOT. THE BOX TRUCK WAS PULLED OUT OF THE DITCH AND UP-RIGHTED. AGAIN, NO FUEL WAS LOST. IT WAS HARD TO TELL IF ANY ACID LEAKED OUT OF THE BOX TRUCK DUE TO ALL THE SNOW. THE EMA TOLD US THAT ALL WAS GOOD AND THAT NO CLEAN UP WAS NEEDED. THE TRUCK WAS TOWED TO THE TOWING COMPANY YARD.  A FEW DAYS LATER EAST PENN WENT TO THE YARD TO RECOVER THE BATTERIES. THE BATTERIES WERE GONE THROUGH, AT OUR PITTSBURGH, PA FACILITY, ONE BY ONE TO CHECK FOR DAMAGE. THE DAMAGED BATTERIES WERE SHIPPED BACK TO OUR EAST PENN MANUFACTURING CO., LYON STATION FACILITY TO OUR SECONDARY LEAD SMELTER FOR RECYCLE/RECOVERY.","THE DRIVER WAS CONSULTED ABOUT GOING TOO FAST FOR THE WEATHER CONDITIONS. THE ACCIDENT WAS SENT TO EAST PENN'S ACCIDENT REVIEW COMMITTEE TO DECIDE IF A CHARGEABLE OR NON-CHARGEABLE INCIDENT. IF THE INCIDENTS DECIDED THAT IT IS CHARGEABLE, THE PROPER DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS WILL BE FOLLOWED.  THE DRIVER'S WERE ALSO GIVEN A TAILGATE, REMINDING THEM ABOUT SAFE DRIVING DURING SNOWY CONDITIONS. THE DRIVER'S WERE ALSO REMINDED THAT IF THEY DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING IN THE CURRENT WEATHER CONDITIONS, THAT THEY SHOULD NOT GO OUT.

TWO OF THEM WERE COMPLETELY EMPTY AND ONE HAD APPROXIMATELY 15-20 GALLONS LEFT IN IT.

DURING THE TRANSPORTATION THERE WAS NO HARD BREAKING EVENTS REPORTED, NOR ANY CRITICAL EVENTS, PLEASE SEE THE EVENTS REPORT BELOW (NO EVENTS FOR UNIT 160). PROBABLE REASON FOR THE DAMAGE OF THE TOTES IS THAT THE LOAD HAD SHIFTED. SINCE THERE WERE NO CRITICAL EVENTS REPORTED, WE BELIEVE THE TOTES WERE NOT LOADED AND SECURED PROPERLY AT THE SHIPPER. AS IT'S SEEN ON THE RATE CONFIRMATION ATTACHED BELOW AND AS PER OUR COMPANY POLICY, THE DRIVER IS NOT ALLOWED TO LOAD OR UNLOAD.","WE BELIEVE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED DUE TO IMPROPER LOADING AND SECURING OF THE CARGO. OFTEN DRIVERS ARE NOT ALLOWED AT THE LOADING DOCK, ESPECIALLY WHEN HAZMAT PRODUCT IS INVOLVED, THEY CAN NOT SEE HOW THE CARGO IS SECURED.

IT WAS AT NIGHT AND WAS RAINING. HE IDENTIFIED THE WHITE COVER FOR REGULAR GASOLINE (DIFFERENT GRADES OF GAS HAVE DIFFERENT COLORED COVERS). HE TOOK A VEEDER-ROOT READING AND IT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS AROUND 2000 GALLONS ALREADY IN THE TANK, BUT HE DID NOT FOLLOW CORRECT PROCEDURE AND STICK THE TANK TO CONFIRM THE READING. SINCE HE WAS EXPECTING THIS TO BE AN 8000 GALLON TANK BY THE COVER COLOR, HE HOOKED UP THE VAPOR RECOVERY LINE AND STARTED TO DROP ONE OF HIS 4000 GALLONS TANKS. SINCE IT WAS RAINING, THE DRIVER WENT AND SAT IN HIS TRUCK. THIS IS ALSO A BREACH OF COMPANY PROTOCOL AND PROCEDURE. OUR POLICY INDICATED THAT DRIVERS MUST STAY WITH THEIR LOADS WHILE DROPPING. AFTER A FEW MINUTES IN THE CAB, HE GOT OUT AND STOOD UNDER THE CANOPY, BUT HE DID NOT HAVE A SITE LINE TO THE DROP POINT. AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES HE WENT TO THE TANK AND NOTICED THAT THE TRUCK TANK WAS EMPTY. WHEN HE WENT TO DISCONNECT, HE SAW THAT E 85 WAS PAINTED ON THE CONCRETE NEAR THE TANK. E85 SHOULD HAVE A BROWN COVER. HE DID NOT SEE THIS WHEN HE SET UP HIS DROP. HE DID NOT SEE ANY GASOLINE IN THE BOWL AND HIS HOSE WAS STILL FIRMLY ATTACHED. OUR DRIVER WAS ALSO ABLE TO EMPTY HIS HOSE BACK INTO THE UNDERGROUND TANK (ABOUT 10 GALLONS), INDICATING THAT THE UST WAS NOT FULL. THIS IS WHERE THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE OF 2000 GALLONS LOST CAME FROM THE E85 TANK IS A 4000 GALLON TANK, IT HAD ABOUT 2000 GALLONS IN IT WHEN HE STARTED TO DROP, THEREFORE 2000 GALLONS ""LOST"". OUR DRIVER ALSO IDENTIFIED A SMALL PINHOLE IN THE VAPOR RECOVERY LINE WITH FUEL COMING OUT. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS VERY SMALL LEAK WAS THE CAUSE OF THE STRAINING IDENTIFIED IN THE PARKING LOT. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT 2000 GALLONS WERE LOST DOWN THE SEWER. FIRST, THE ODOR OF THAT MUCH GASOLINE WOULD BE OVERPOWERING THERE WAS NO ODOR. SECOND, THE PARKING LOT WOULD HAVE BEEN FLOODED WITH THAT MUCH GAS-IT WAS NOT. IN FACT, THERE WAS NO STANDING GASOLINE AT ALL.    THERE WAS NEVER ANY GASOLINE IDENTIFIED IN ANY OF THE BOOMS SET IN THE WATERWAYS AND NO VAPOR WAS EVER DETECTED USING THE PID DETECTORS. THIS IS CLEARLY STATED IN OUR REMEDIATION CONSULTANTS REPORT. THAT FACT THAT OUR DRIVER IDENTIFIED GASOLINE LEAKING FROM THE VAPOR RECOVERY LINE INDICATED THAT THERE WAS FUEL IN THE VAPOR RECOVERY LINE WHEN THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY VAPOR.  WE BELIEVE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT, PERHAPS 1-2 GALLONS, WAS RELEASE IN THE PARKING LOT THROUGH THE VAPOR RECOVERY LINE. THE REST OF THE FUEL WAS LIKELY FORCED THROUGH THE VAPOR RECOVERY LINE BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE IN THE TANK AND END UP IN THE OTHER UNDERGROUND TANKS. THERE IS ONLY ONE VAPOR RECOVERY LINE THAT IS CONNECTED TO ALL TANKS. THIS SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES IS RELATIVELY COMMON IN THE INDUSTRY.  IT MAKES NO SENSE THAT WE COULD HAVE LOST 2000 GALLONS DOWN THE STORM SEWER. THE TANK HAS A VALVE COVER ONTO WHICH OUR HOSE WAS STILL FIRMLY  ATTACHED, SO THE ONLY PLACE FOR THE GAS TO GO IS INTO THE VAP","ALL OUR DRIVERS HAVE BEEN RE INSTRUCTED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FOLLOWING THE CORRECT FUEL DROP PROCEDURES, AND THIS PROCEDURE HAS BEEN REINFORCED IN OUR TRAINING. IN THIS CASE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE DRIVER WAS FEARFUL OF LOSING HIS JOB SO DID NOT IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE VITAL INFORMATION LIKE THE FUEL COMING OUT OF THE VAPOR RECOVERY LINE. OUR FIELD SUPERVISOR HAS BEEN AUDITING ALL OUR CUSTOMERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COVERS ARE ALL THE RIGHT COLOR. OFTEN IN THE WINTER, THE COVERS CAN BE RIPPED OFF BY SNOW PLOWS AND STATION OPERATORS WILL REPLACE THEM WITH WHATEVER THEY HAVE AVAILABLE. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED THAT THE VEEDER-ROOT SYSTEM AT THIS STATION WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY AND GIVING FALSE READINGS. THIS, AS WELL, IS NOT UNCOMMON IN THE INDUSTRY, AND WHY WE INSIST THAT DRIVERS STICK THE TANKS AND NOT RELY EXCLUSIVELY ON THIS SYSTEM. WE BELIEVE THAT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO REQUIRE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE ON THESE SYSTEMS BY STATION OWNERS TO PREVENT SIMILAR ISSUES.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10000,ATLAS OIL COMPANY,US,
