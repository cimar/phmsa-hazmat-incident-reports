The leak was reported to CSXI Terminal personnel who reponded an emergency response contractor. Six bags were found broken open and leaking. The damaged bags were placed into over pack drums and returned to the container for final delivery. Remediation generated 150 pounds of contaminated product and held at the terminal for proper disposal. The lading was block/brace for final delivery via highway to destination.    Cause of the incident is shipper liability due to no blocking and bracing. Improper loading allowed the lading to shift toward the rear of the container where there was a 4ft void.

Inspection of the car found that the leak was coming from the top of the car under the protective housing. Further inspection found seal and pin on housing intact and after opening the housing the 3 inch top load valve assembly was found to be leaking at the bottom flange. The 3 inch valve was loose and could be moved by hand. also the 3 inch and 2 inch plugs on the 3 inch loading valce and 2 inch induction valve were only hand tight. This 3 inch valve and the 2 inch valve had just been changes or repaired as there was fresh teflon tape on the threads.  3 inch valve was tightened by use of a 36 inch pipe wrench to refusal and leak was stopped.  the design of the 3 inch valve and its handle and the 2 inch valve precluded the 3 inch valve from being tightened unless the handle on the 3 inch valve was opened and the 3 inch pipe plug on the valve removed to allow the 3 inch valve to be tightened to refuseal. car was alos overloaded and no proper outage was taken on this shipment,"When valves are changed on a car be sure and tighten the vales to refusal and use vales where when applied to the car the valve need not be opened to tighten the valve down.

Approximately 1 pint had leaked through the floor of the trailer onto the ground.

The inspector notified the Frontier Yard Trainmaster and the area was isolated. The TERP plan was initiated. HazMat Mgr. M.C. Bethge was notified to respond and investigate the odor. Upon arrival, M.C. Bethge found the B-End Liquid Line Valve to be leaking vapors between the valve base and the pressure plate around the securement studs. Attempts to tighten the stud nuts were not successful in stopping the vapor leak. CSXT ER Contractor, SPSI, was called to respond with a Midland Cap Kit.  Tank Car UTLX 950435 was switched from outbound Q62608 onto class track #63 and isolated from the yard area. Buffalo Fire Dept. HazMat inspected the vapor leak. Canutec was notified at 0352 hrs report # TLR2007-499, NYS-DEC was notified at 0400 hrs report # 0703929 and the NRC was notified at 0412 hrs. report #841332.  SPSI  capped the b-end liquid valve at 0915 hours on 08Jul07 with a Midlind kit. The rail car was  inspected and pressure was monitored daily.  SPSI returned to Buffalo on 14Jul07 to transfer UTLX 950435. The transfer was completed on 14Jul07 at 1930 hrs. The product was transloaded into TILX 303029.

When he started moving towards the rear of the trailer he noticed the product leaking from the bottom  side of the drum. The driver quickly stopped and placed the drum on its side with the small hole facing upward to stop the leak.   The driver used Soda Ash to absorb and neutralize the spill. He then placed the clean up material and drum of Sulfuric Acid inside of a recovery drum.,During the investigation it was found that the foot of the drum dolly was bent upward and out. This defective equipment was what caused the damage to the drum. As a result of the findings we took the equipment out of service and are purchasing new.

The store has 2 NL tanksso he was going to put 3000 gallons of NL that was in Comp 1 into NL tanks #2, and was going to put 2000 gallons that was in Comp 2&3 into tank #1 for NL. Comp2 had 1000 gallon NL and comp 3 had 1000 gallons of NL. He hooked up comp 1 to NL tank 2 and began to unload, then hooked comp 2 to NL tank 1. The rabbit ears hooked to the NL tank 1  wasn't on tight enough and when he pulled the handle the hose popped off the evertite fitting and fuel came out. Right away within seconds Bartlett shut the valve off, and fuel was going down the parking lot. He grabbed all the rags in the valve box and put them on the spill. He saw the fuel going to what he thought was a  drain so he grabbed all the rags that were in the cab of the truck and ran ahead of the fuel that was moving toward the drain and he started to plug the drain with rags. He was able to put the rags in the drain before the fuel reach it. He then called Selma dispatch and was told to call 911 immediately. He called 911 and Bartlett told them that what had happen and to send Fire Dept. After he got off the phone with 911, he then called dispatch back again and was then asked to call Ricky in Fayetteville and have him go to the store with clean up stuff, and to call Ronnie McCoy. At first the driver thought the spill was a 100 gallons or less. Then when the Fire Dept. got there they put this dry on the ground and me and a fireman did measurements of the tank levels and guessed the spill to be about 40 gallons. The Hazmat Captain did his measuremants and said the spill was under 10 gallons. Bartlett said he guess high numbers becasue he wasn't really sure how much was spilt and people kept asking him, so he said 100 gallons or less.    river failed to properly secure hose allowing disconnection and spill of 40-50 gallons.  Contained to asphalt.  Driver protected drain to oil/water separator, but City of Fayetteville environmental department wanted it inspected and flushed if contaminated.

The driver had a strap through the hadle of the drum and had it attached to his e-trac in the trailer.

Shipping Operator was charged with loading a tank truck with JEFFAMINE® T-403. JEFFAMINE T-403 is a product made in a continuous operation from a polyol and ammonia. JEFFAMINE T-403 is used in epoxy applications. The truck to be loaded arrived at the Huntsman Corp. Conroe Site at 2323 hours to load a shipment of approximately 48,000 lbs of JEFFAMINE T-403. The truck is owned by Heniff Transportation Systems, Inc. This shipment was to be made against our order 4570013495. The Shipping Operator lined up the tank and loading equipment to load. He then spotted the truck at the loading site. He performed a preload inspection on the truck and approved it to load. The Shipping Operator attached the appropriate loading hoses and set the meter to load 48,000 lbs as required by the order. The Shipping Operator then started the load. Loading commenced at 2340 on July 1. At approximately 0045 hours on July 2, the Shipping Operator noticed that the product was flowing out of the 3” wash out cap on the top of the tank truck. He immediately went to the loading site and closed a manual valve to stop the spill. A total of 15,764 lbs of product was lost. Based on the amount of product lost, the actual overflow was for approximately 9 minutes. The Operator immediately notified the Lead Operator in Charge. Clean up began immediately. The sewer system was switched to capture the spilled material in our waste water tank. All of the liquid material was captured in our waste water tank. The waste water was then shipped off-site for disposal in a deep well. A root cause investigation was performed on July 6, 2007 and action items were developed to prevent a reoccurrence of a similar incident.","Several action items to prevent a reoccurrence of a similar incident were developed during the incident investigation. The main cause of the incident was that the automatic shut off valve failed to close because a manual/automatic selection switch was not put in the automatic position because the operator was not aware that there was switch. He had loaded many trucks through this same system and had never switched the switch. It was assumed that since there were no earlier incidents, that the switch had previously been in the automatic position. The switch was positioned remote from the meter and it was, therefore, not obvious that there was a switch. The operator reported that he had not been trained to review the switch position on this meter before loading and was notaware that the switch existed. Action items were developed to label the meters that had remote switches so that operators would be reminded of their existence and retrain all operators to ensure that all know the existence of this switch and any other remote switches that might exist in the loading area. In addition, we will investigate the possibility of interlocking the meters with the automatic switches to prevent the start of a load using a meter without the valve being in the automatic position or, if that is not feasible, to move remote switches closer to the meter.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,21552,HUNTSMAN CORP,US,

The driver made a defensive move to avoid one or more persons in the roadway who were gathering items that fell from a vehicle.  The tractor and trailer left the roadway and overturned laying across the southbound lanes and into the dirt median.  The fire and police departments were summoned to the location.  It is unclear how long it took for the arrival of the first responders and the actions taken to prevent and migration of the product of diesel fuel.      The tractor sustained heavy damage to the driver's side and the fuel tank on the same side was leaking fuel from the cap.  The trailer was laying down an embankment at a 45 degree angle with its nose rising towards the roadway.  HMHTTC called upon H2O to respond to the scene and contain any leaks and transfer the load of sodium nitrate.  Upon their arrival, the response team laid down absorbents near the leaking fuel tank to prevent furthe rmigration of the fuel.  Additionally, they found a minor leak from the washout cap and placed a poly bucket under the cap to contain the leak.  The damage to the trailer was mostly to the outer jacket.  The weather at the time of MVA was clear and dry.     After a effort led by Disttech and HMHTTC, a tanker was located and arrived at 1315 hours to accept the load of sodium nitrate.  The transfer was completed by 1707 hours.  The response team removed the valve assembly on the bottom of the tanker as it was the only accessible spot to remove the product.      After obtaining the markouts for underground utilities and required permits, the response team returned to the site to excavate the contaminated soil.  Upon completion, soil samples were grabbed for analysis.  The soil was replaced, tamped and seed and an erosion blanket placed on top.","In this particular incident, it is our understanding that the driver was was attempting to avoid hitting one or more persons in the roadway who were picking up items in the roadway which fell from the vehicle.

An employee at the location noticed small amount of material seeping through the van trailer floor.  He immediately notified his supervisor of the spill and an in house emergency response crew was dispatched to identify the source of release and to take all necessary corrective actions.  Upon review of the paperwork, the emergency response crew donned appropriate protective equipment and entered the trailer.  An inspection of the non-bulk packages in the trailer identified that a single 55-gallon UN 1A2 container of Class 3 flammable liquid was not properly closed in preparation for transportation.  The lid of the container was not properly secured and permitted escape of the hazardous materials during transportation.  The response crew immediately used a chemically compatible absorbent material to contain approximately 10 gallons of liquid that was release to the floor of the trailer.   The lid of the leaking drum was repositioned and properly fastened.  All of the absorbent was collected and placed into appropriate container for disposal at an approved hazardous waste management facility.   Approximately one quart of material leaked through the floorboards of the van-trailer onto the concrete containment pad.      All of the released material was collected and no offsite impact occurred.",Our investigation determined that the cause of the incident was improper preparation of the package for transportation and insufficient inspection prior to transportation.

This load was brought back to Clean Harbors Facility located at 51 Broderick Road, Bristol, CT. This load was reloaded along with other wastes in one of our staged empty trailers and its destination was Reidsville, NC. On July 16, Our Driver (Conrod Gillin) picked up the loaded trailer, conducted a pre-trip, and signed the manifests. Mr. Gillin began to drive to his destination which was Clean Harbors Environmental Services located on 208 Watlington Industrial Drive in Reidsville, NC. On July 17, 2007 while traveling South Bound on 1-95 near mile marker 138, a citizen advised our driver that something was leaking out of his trailer. He stopped along the side of the road and discovered a small stream of liquid coming out of the trailer. Mr. Gillin opened the trailer doors, discovering a poly barrel (55gallons) lying over and liquid leaking from a bung hole. Mr. Gillin called dispatch and roiled he barrel over, stopping the leak. The Fredericksburg Fire Department arrived and took over the scene. They determined that the poly drum containing a (Waste Nitrating Acid Mixture Spent) was bulging and had been leaking from the bung hole from around the plug. They placed this drum into an over pack barrel and an environmental clean-up response team (IMS) took responsibility for the scene. In the process of cleaning up the scene, IMS placed 3 additional barrels containing the same solution into over pack barrels because they were bulging. Subsequently, the Fire Department had 1-95 closed for 3 hours during this incident. IMS estimated 15-20 gallons of solution had leaked from the barrel. A post incident Level 1, Commercial Vehicle Safety Check was conducted. This report indicated that the leaking material was improperly packaged and the load was not secured (Properly blocked/braced).  The primary cause of this leak was improper packaging by the hazardous waste generator. The generator placed the waste nitrating acid mixture in a poly (plastic) barrel and it should have been placed into a stainless steel barrel. This mixture expanded (over time and elevating temperatures) causing the barrel to bulge on the sides as well as base which made the barrel wobbly or unstable. Had this material been packaged properly in stainless steel, there would not have been any bulging which would have kept the barrel from rocking. Regardless weather Clean Harbors used better blocking and bracing when loading the trailer, if the barrel fell over it would not have leaked.","We have developed additional training for drivers. This training entails how to use the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49 to extract information for their loads. This training would cover proper packaging, markings, placarding and shipping papers. We have also advised employees about the  regulations for proper load securement and how this can be achieved by using blocking and bracing.  Schwerdtle Stamp Company (Waste Generator) was notified about the improper packaging.

In or about May 2007, certain multipurpose lighters were manufactured in China incorporating newly designed components. A third party surveyor was retained in Hong Kong to survey and report on the subject shipment of multipurpose lighters prior to its embarkation to Savannah, Georgia. The particulars of the survey included a gas leakage test. No gas leakage was detected.  Despite having received confirmation that no gas leakage was detected prior to shipment, in an abundance of caution, arrangements were made to have the container inspected upon its arrival in the Foreign Trade Zone at the Port of Savannah, Georgia. Without opening the container, a sample probe was inserted through the door seals of the container. Air samples were instantly analyzed for the presence of flammable gas.  The container arriving July 19, 2007 tested positive for the presence of a small quantity of flammable gas. A HAZMAT contractor was immediately hired to open and ventilate the container. After thoroughly ventilating the container, individual packages were inspected. No packages had been opened or damaged in any way.  Next, the interior of the packages were monitored for the presence of flammable gas. On July 25, after thorough testing of the inside of the packages indicated no additional gas was leaking, packages were reloaded into the container and sent to the final destination for further testing and evaluation of the lighters.","STRICT QUALITY CONTROL AT THE PRODUCT MANUFACTURING FACILITY HAS BEEN RE-EMPHASIZED IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT POTENTIAL FUTURE INCIDENTS SIMILAR TO THE ONE DESCRIBED.

Car Inspector made notification to on duty Trainmaster who is trained through the Incident Commander level who subsequently responded and together with the Car Inspector were able to identify the rail car as GATX 9343 containing Ammonia Anhydrous, UN 1005. Trainmaster in accordance with “Emergency Response Guidelines” cleared the area and created a safety zone in accordance with the guidelines. Trainmaster remained on scene to ascertain extent of vapor emanating from car and noted very, very little odor and notified “Chemtrec”. Riverdale (Illinois) Fire Department was contacted and responded to scene with Truck Company, EMS and Hazardous Material Response Team. Indiana Harbor Belt (IHB) Flazardous Material Officer and Chief Hazmat Officer of Fire Service inspected car and noted a slight odor vapor emanating from the enclosed dome. Chief Hazmat Officer for Fire Service reported to Riverdale Fire Chief his findings who subsequently ordered a clear zone in accordance with Hazmat protocol around the railcar. IHB Hazmat Officer contacted Shipper and Contractor “Sun Pro Services” who subsequently responded to scene and upon inspecting under dome cover discovered Pressure Relief Deviice (PRD) with a very minor leak. Further investigation revealed a bad “0” rings under “0” ring lid which were subsequently changed along with “0” ring lid and leak was stopped. Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) Inspector, Ann Monroe also on scene.  During subsequent investigation into rail car it was determined that car was delivered in error to IHB railroad by the CFE railroad.","During course of event, substantial corrosion was noted inside dome cover and inside “0” ring lid containing the “O”rings.

Tim O’Brien, Regional Manager of Hazardous Materials, was notified and responded.

At   04:28 AM, O’Brien advised he had inspected the tankcar and found a number of loose fittings, however the fitting thought to be the cause of the release was a loose quick fill port. Mr. O’Brien stated all loose fittings were secured. Mr. O’Brien further advised that the car department would move the tankcar in daylight hours to ensure the integrity of the fittinps. At 07:45 AM, Empress Stevenson, Manager Yard Operations, reported Tankcar RCRX 1285 was bumped and was still releasing a small amount of product. Geoffrey Reeder, Environmental Site Remediation, was notified and responded. Reeder inspected the car and found all fittings appeared tight. Some liquid was visible on the manway. The seal was taken off the fill port and the nut tightened. Seals CTS 2113, 2123, and 2121 were placed on the fitting. Not finding a source of the release, Reeder had a switch engine couple Into the car. The coupling force revealed the manway as source of the release. The 20 bolts on the manway were tightened.

Mr. Villegas stated the car was isolated at the north end of Track 203. Upon being notified, Mgr. Lerch advised theRMCC that he was aware of the incident and that there was a vapor release of product. Mgr. Lerch further stated the tank car hadbeen isolated with no threat of injury to employees, and that the car would be repaired during daylight hours. After inspection of the carat 08:08 AM, Mgr. Lerch noted one of eight manway swing bolts to be in position, not wrench tight, and the vacuum relief valve was leaking vapor due to a failed O-ring. Mgr. Lerch tightened the manway swingbolt one turn. Mgr. Lerch then contacted the shipper, South Coast Terminal Plant, and spoke to Frank Layne, Rail Coordinator advising him of the noted exceptions. Mr. Layne then made arrangements to have the car inspected by plant personnel.At 02:00 PM the car was inspected by South Coast Terminal Plant personnel, and determined that the vacuum relief valve would have to be replaced. Arrangements were made to have a mobile rail carrepair unit respond the next day to replace the valve.

I looked at the lids and didn't notice the leak fromthe lid. There must have been some leaking from the bottom of the can.

During this call MEl management collected information about the size of the area contaminated during the discharge, type of surfaces impacted and what emergency corrective action were taken to contain the spilled product. MEl management also spoke to the plant manger of RE-GEN Mike Cantelmo and Franz Mullings environmental office for Re-Gen regarding the release and to verify the amount of material that was released both inside and out of the unloading containment pad. At this time MEl management was informed that the employees of ReGen, in conjunction with WCI personnel had spread out lime and sand on the affected areas of the release to contain and neutralize the material and to minimize additional contamination from occurring.   7/25/07 — 6:20 PM MEl project manager, Ted McCutcheon, Placed a call to the generator of the Ferrous Chloride Solution, WorldClass Processing Ambridge PA, that was being transported by MEl truck acknowledging that MEl was aware of a problem our driver had encountered during offloading at the Re-Gen facility and that we were in contact with our driver, the plant manager of Re-Gen as well as there Environmental office Franz Mullings regarding the cleanup efforts of this release.   7/25/07 6:30 PM   Conference call was placed to Franz Mullings & Mike Cantelmo by Tim Dobrosky & Ted McCutcheon to discuss remedial activities that needed to be addressed and collect information to complete and put into action MEl Contingency Plan. Franz Mullings did advise MEl that materials that were cleaned up at this site would need to be handled as a K062 waste for disposal. This was mandated by Re-Gen’s operational permit for this site.   Franz Mullings advised Mike Cantelmo to collect several soil samples, draw a map of the area where the samples were taken and test the PH of the soil to verify neutralization of the material was successful.

MEl inquired to the amount of material that they had piled up so a roll off container could be sent to the site by MEl for this material to be placed into it.
