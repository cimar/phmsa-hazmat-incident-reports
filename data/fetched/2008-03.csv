On March 4, 2008 the drums were transported and off loaded at the Casie facility and placed in a contained RCRA storage area for 10 day transfer. According to the driver that transported the drums and the supervisor at our facility, the drums were not leaking at the time of initial transport and were not leaking when received for storage and transfer. Two (2) drums however were corroded at the base ring. Apparently, upon off loading and storage of the drums for transfer, the movement caused the drums to seep the material onto the pavement. Upon discovery, all five(5) drums were immediately overpacked to prevent further seepage or discharge. The drums are now enviro mentally safe for transport to the receiving facility.","The incident was discussed with all of the company truck drivers on Saturday, March 8, 2008 at our annual OSHA 8 hour refresher training. The drivers were instructed to inspect all drums thoroughly prior to transport foiany damage, defects, or leaks. Also to call the dispatcher if any defects are discovered so as to be able to provide overpacks or new drums prior to transport.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CASIE PROTANK,US,

It is a fake description that had to be used because the DOT electronic submission of data rules require this information. We do not actually have the information since this was an undeclared shipment. What we do know is that the driver making the deliver  y saw 5.1 Oxidizer labels on the freight during the delivery. He questioned ABF on why this material did not require a hazmat shipping paper. We have the same question but there is no reasonable explanation so it is being reported as an undeclared shipment.

Crew noted car to be leaking liquid from the top of the car while car was under movement.  Product appeared to be evaporating as i ran down the sides of the car.  Car safely isolated.    CR Mgr. Risk Mgmt. A. Richter was notified, and further contacted emergency response contractor Eagle Construction, Findlay, OH, to respond.  Eagle's initial inspection found the securement seal for the bread box broken.  Upon opening the car, it was noted that all valves/fittings had been removed and replaced with either solid closure plugs, or blind closure flanges.  However, the 4-bolt blind closure flange for the 3"" liquid eduction line was missing all four bolts, and not secured over the liquid eduction opening.    All four bolts were replaced the following morning of Friday, 3/21/08; liquid line blind closure flange secured, and all other fittings inspected to insure proper securement.

He was asked to pull around to the rear for a routine level 2 inspection. the inspector smelled Ammonia at the trailer and at that time callled Fire and hazmat.Our driver could not amell the leak. The inspector would not allow our driver (with proper PPE) to go back to the truck to find and stop the leak. When hazmat arrived they tested the area around the truck at 10 PPM, said there was no danger and returned to their station. We dispatched our Field Service unit to the site to correct the problem. He arrived and pulled the pressure off of the pump which stopped the leak (took app. 5 minutes). the driver was told he could leave and he returned to the plant at Columbus, Ga. The pump was rebuilt at the plant.  The leak point was from a weep hole in the bottom of the bearing housing on the truck pump. The hole allows any leak from the pump seal to escape and not do damage to the bearing.There was a small seal leak which was escaping from this weep hole.

The leaks were coming from holes where the bin, #LA-095, teeter bar was attached and also from areas on the legs where there are small cracks in the poly legs.  The bin was in a containment tray and the leak was very slow and the product was crystalizing as it came out.  A spill clean up company, CTI, was called and responded to handle the spill.   Approximately two pounds total came out of the container based on visual determination after the spill was cleaned.      The bin began its journey when it was picked up at the customer on 02-28-08 and was delivered to the LA warehouse on the same day. It was then shipped from LA to PX on 03-06-08 and arrived in PX on 03-07-08.

BN 875053 was switched out of the train, carefully moved and isolated in the railyard with a containment pool place under this tank car. This bottom outlet auxiliary valve configuration is a  center T-piping arrangement with extensions and an end cap that extend to either side of the bottom of this tank car for unloading purposes. A cracked flange weld was observed on the right side pipe extension. Product was dripping from this weld crack at the flange connection. The top operated bottom outlet operating rod was in the closed position, but product was by-passing the closed valve into the bottom T-piping. On 4/01/08, the product (company material diesel fuel) in BN 875053 was transferred into a BNSF fuel service provider's fuel trucks and earmarked for local BNSF usage. BN 875053 will be scheduled and sent to a qualified repair facility for the auxiliary T-pipe fitting removal and repairs to the top operated bottom outlet valve.

The unloading hoses were connected from the intermediate bulk container, (IBC) to be offloaded and the unloading pump. A second hose was connected between the threaded discharge outlet of the pump coupling and the customers receiving tank. The employee secured and inspected all connections ensuring that there were no leaks. Upon receiving approval to begin offloading the employee activated the offloading pump by engaging the air. As the unloading process began the threaded discharge coupling between the pump and the receiving tank cracked causing approximately 15 gallons of sodium hydroxide solution to be released into the immediate area. The employee shut down the transfer pump stopping the flow. While doing this, the unloading employee was splashed with sodium hydroxide solution originating from the cracked fitting. The employee was moved to a safety shower and rinsed off. The employee was subsequently transported to  MetroHealth Hospital, Cleveland OH,  for medical evaluation. The employee was treated at the hospital for superficial chemical burns to the right and left thigh & a small superficial chemical burn to the neck. The employee was admitted to the hospital for further observation by the treating physician. The employee was released the following day and returned to work on a restricted basis. Facility employees cleaned up the area affected by the release. The recovered material was containerized for subsequent disposal at a licensed, permitted disposal facility. The  transport unit was returned to the shipping facility for further examination. The failed coupling was examined and it was determined that the weight of the material in the transfer hose in conjunction with the pressure of the discharge pump contributed to the failure of the threaded coupling. To prevent future occurrences, a non threaded coupling was installed on the discharge port of the pump. This incident was reviewed with affected facility personnel and also at a facility safety meeting.","To prevent future occurrences, a non threaded coupling was installed on the discharge port of the pump.

It was loaded with and in dedicated service for Ethylene Glycol. While in the process of prepping for unloading by CUSTOMER personnel, the external valve shaft was backed all the way out of the outer plate yoke and packing gland and actually came out of the valve assembly completely. As the internal valve was open, EG flowed out of the valve thru the packing gland. Only a small amount of material escaped the tank prior to internal valve EMERG shutdown. It was estimated by facility MGMT that 2-3 gallons were spilled. Material was cleaned up in house using absorbents and basic response methods.    The valve that failed in this incident was a Betts QRB Hydrolet valve model# QY763SST. Upon disassembly of the outer valve clamp and plate, the valve seat assembly was found loose in the valve body. The cotter pin that normally secures the valve seat assembly to the threaded valve shaft end was missing and was not found inside the valve body. This would lead us to believe that A. The cotter pin was installed improperly at last washing reassembly or B. the cotter pin was not installed at all.    This cargo tank is a leased unit. Lessor performs all cleaning and maint on this tank.     As a result of this incident, the leasing company was contacted regarding the incident and our findings. Corrective action measure are outlined in part VII of this report.","Leasing company has been advised that as a result of this incident, we will begin routing all trailers to thier facility for valve takedown and inspection to insure we don’t have any  other hidden valve issues. This measure was instituted the day of the incident.    Formal Corrective action response from the Leasing Co. is as follows:      ""I have voiced your  concerns to all corresponding departments. In addition I have been working diligently with management at our tank wash, and have implemented a new Checklist. In addition to the wash tickets already being placed on the clean tanks a form will be placed stating that all of your trailers will be checked for the following: Vac. test performed (internal/external valve), All gaskets in place, External valve assembly (including cotter pins) are complete, and Number of hoses on trailer as it leaves the wash rack.

The tank selected was partially full and the Ethanol that was off loaded caused the tank to overflow into the tank retention dike area.    When the error was discovered the off loading was stopped and emergency spill procedures were enacted. (Building electric shut down and room isolated from the rest of the facility.)    There was no fire and the leak was mostly confined to the retention dike, this was subsequently removed by a remediation crew for disposal.   Some material leaked from the retention dike due to a seal failure, this was contained in the room drain fire control tank that is located outside of the building.  This was subsequently pumped out by the remediation crew.    The waste will be disposed of at an approved EPA incinerator.      #25) Road Tanker did not have a failure.  Human error caused the storage tank to overflow.",The existing unloading procedure will be reviewed with staff involved.   A level switch to shut down the loading pump will be installed to prevent overfilling.

Ridge Road,GREEN BAY,WI,54306,Carrier,Schneider National Bulk Driver reported finding product spilled in the crash box of the tank trailer during his post trip inspection. The seal at the dome lid was not sufficient which allowed product to leak out into the crash box. The driver cleaned up the product spill in the crash box. A foam sealant was put around the dome lid to provide a secure seal and the trailer continued on to the destination. The trailer has  been inspected and it has been determined that the rubber lining at the top ridge of the man hole has cracks or tears in it which resulted in it not sealing properly. The trailer is in the maintenance shop for repairs to the liner.,The pre-trip inspection by the driver should include the visual inspection of the liner around the dome lid area of the trailer. The driver did not do a thorough enough inspection prior to loading the trailer. The driver has been counseled regarding this. The pre-trip inspection should have caught the liner issue and we could have avoided loading this trailer until the repairs were completed.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

PROX 43802 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard awaiting a detailed inspection. BNSF contract responders reported finding 2 of 6 manway securement bolts less than tool tight. Further inspection revealed that the manway cover gasket was misaligned with a section of this gasket folded over out of the gasket groove. The gasket was inspected, deemed serviceable and it was properly repositioned. The manway lid was closed and all manway securement bolts were properly tool tightened. All other valves and fittings were inspected with no other exceptions noted. New seals were applied to the manway and the valve protective housing cover. The dried (evaporated) residue product stains along with other oily residue were wiped from the side shell and the side ladders. No ground impact from this product release was evident.

One package caught fire a short distance up the first conveyor belt. The employees stopped the belt and left the trailer. As the supervisor called 911 an employee used the nearest fire extinguisher to douse the flames, preventing damage to other packages or any equipment. The package was marked ORM-D, level 2 aerosols. It was the only package involved in the fire. The east primary (unload) area was evacuated. The fire department arrived at approximately 23.33 hrs and urged UPS to involve a professional fire investigator to evaluate the incident. Our professional fire investigator subsequently determined that one of the aerosols had been punctured in an impact compressing it between two adjacent cans in the box. The burn pattern indicated that only the flammable liquid component of the aerosol (containing ethanol) was involved in the fire, and that a portion of the liquid remained in the can Based on this evidence, the investigator concluded that the puncture had occurred at some time before the package was removed from the pallet on UPS",SHIPPER IMPROVEMENT OF PACKAGING TECHNIQUES.,Yes,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,150,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,0,UPS,US,

I loosened the packing nut roughly one turn and started to pull up. The slip tube packing nut started to leak a small amount of vapor. I pushed the slip tube back down and tightened the nut, but I still detected a small leak at the packing. I then loosened the nut and pulled the slip tube all the way up and tightened the packing nut. The leak stopped at this time.    I immediately called Chemtrec to notify them that they needed to contact the shipper in response to the defective slip tube. Canadian Enterprise called soon after my call to Chemtrec. We discussed the best way to handle the problem. They suggested unloading the car of liquid and then vaporing the down the car to about 5 PSI. So that a Union Tank car repair crew could replace the packing so we could stop the leak when the slip tube was pushed down into the car for safe shipping.  After unloading the car of liquid and vaporing down to 5 PSI, I pushed the slip tube down back down into the car to see if I could get it non-leak tight. I could and I did.  then called the UTLX Repair Crew and informed them of the circumstances. They came to the site and repaired the packing at the slip tube. Then they okayed the release of the car after checking to make sure it was not leaking.  After talking to Ernie Sirotek (Business Card enclosed), I learned that the small leak around the slip tube is somewhat of a normal occurrence during the gauging process with this old-style slip tube device. W would not consider this an unintentional release due to the way these gauges operate.","I would suggest eventually doing away with this old-style of gauging device would be helpful. While this style remains in service, replacing the packing more often may also address the issue. The older the rail car, the more problems occur with this kind gauging device.    Sheldon United Terminal now has a specific, personal contact at UTLX just a short distance from our plant. It is a big help as the crew is 24-hour and mobile.  I have also enclosed the repair notice from UTLX for the car and the supervisor’s business card.",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,SHELDON UNITED TERMINAL,US,

It was discovered by terminal personnel a leak originating from the subject freight container. The leaking container was placed in a mobile containment unit and isolated pending further remediation. Local police and fire agencies, as well as local port authority, were contacted. In addition, a third party environmental response contractor (Cliff Berry International) was contacted. The spill was subsequently remediated and the source of the leak identified. The subject IBC was found to have a partially closed discharge valve. This was concluded to be due to vibrations during transport. Thus, the valves were secured and then tie-strapped for safety. All recovered spill waste was handled by CliffBerry and subsequently processed for disposal by the same. The remainder of this shipment rendered safe for ocean transport and shipped accordingly. NOTE: Undeclared hazmat was discovered upon the opening of this freight container, thus, this will be reflected in a separate & subsequent report.

E-2008040453)Correction to Initial Report Findings:It was noted that undeclared hazmat was discovered upon the opening of the involved freight container, and that this information would be reflected in a separate and subsequent report; however, this was in fact an erroneous comment.On a separate but relevant note, an incident involving this same shipment was reported by Florida East Coast Railway (""FEC"") to have occurred on 3/17/2008 at the FEC facility in Miami (Ref. E-2008030299, filed by FEC on3/24/2008). Specifically, it was reported that both a hazmat spill had occurred, and an undeclared hazmat was discovered, with the same shipment. However, it was erroneously stated on the subject report that the shipper ofrecord was Seaboard Marine LTD, when in fact it was Tintek USA, as evidenced by the actual shipping papers (See additional related information on this and the initial report).",Shippers should ensure that these reusable packages (i.e. IBC's) have all there valves closed AND positively secured to ensure that they will not open up during the course of transportation.

The fire department responded at approximately 2115 hrs. Although the outer carton was substantially burned, subsequent examination of the package revealed that the package had been marked as a Consumer commodity, ORM-D; the inner containers were marked as Westech DM Easy, an industrial adhesive. Of the 12 aerosols in the package, one appeared to have been punctured near the base, possibly in an impact from the chime of an adjacent can.

TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE,42 LONGWATER DRIVE,NORWELL,MA,02061,Carrier,"A van trailer operated by Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc. was enrooted from the shipper’s location to the intended waste management facility. During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at Clean Harbors Aragonite, UT facility where it was placed into temporary in-transit storage. During the course of storage, a 55 gallon polyethylene drive containing 19 compressed gases lecture bottles of oxygen were being moved. Please note that the container in question was being utilized as an overpack to consolidate and secure the individual cylinders for ease of handling. During the transfer operation, a “hissing sound” was heard and the equipment operator stopped the transfer operation and moved away from the container and notified the on-scene emergency coordinator. Upon arrival of the on scene emergency coordinatory, it was discovered that the lid of the polyethylene drum was forced off the drum due to an over pressurization within the overpack. The container was inspected and it was determined that the venting had stopped. The over pack was moved to an isolation room where each individual cylinder was inspected. An inspection of the cylinders indicated that one of the valves of a cylinder was partially open and that allowed the oxygen to collect in the headspace of the drum that eventually forced the lid off the container. It is estimated that the duration of the release was instantaneous once the lid was dislodged and the vapors dispersed into the atmosphere. It is believed that the release did not cause any adverse effects to the environment or the individuals handling the containers. At the conclusion of the response activities, the cylinders were secured and were sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility.","Subsequent to the incident, an investigation was initiated and it was determined that the cause of the release was most likely attributed to a loose valve. Prior to transportation, each cylinder was inspected and placed into the 55 gallon polyethylene overpack in an upright position surrounded by a chemically compatible cushioning/packaging material. It is believed that 2 valves came in contact while in transportation causing one valve to partially open. The escaping oxygen from the cylinder collected in the head space of the container and forced the lid from the package. Our investigation also determined that the polyethylene overpack had the lid securely fastened that allowed the gas to accumulate in the headspace of the package. At the time the container was accepted for transportation no evidence of leakage or pressure build-up was evident. In order to prevent a recurrence, we have initiated a review of the company’s pre-transportation inspection procedures for compressed gas cylinders as well as the guidance document used for the preparation of cylinders for transportation. This document, when updated, will be distributed and reviewed with all applicable personnel and will be incorporated into the company’s training program. In addition, restrictions will be placed on the type, size and quantity of cylinders that can be placed in a single over pack. Finally, all employees involved in the preparation and transportation of this specific shipment were retrained in cylinder handling procedures.",No,CYLINDER,"Seamless steel, made of definitely prescribed steels",3AA,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,0,"CLEAN HARBORS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.",US,
