Item was a photographic lens which had been in DoD storage. Shipped to consignee in crate.   Based on the level of radioactivity provided by DoD in an email received on 2/5/2015: BLUF: Dose levels are not at a level that would cause a health or safety concern. Survey results from MCAAP RSO indicated a package surface dose rate of 3.9 mR/hr using a Ludlum Model 2241-2 Ratemeter/Scaler coupled to a Geiger-Mueller Probe. The instrument was current with its calibration. 3.9 mR/hr was stated by DoD as a possible overestimation as a GM will tend to over respond due to the lower energy gammas and beta that would not be in the Cesium-137 used for calibration.

This amount was subtracted from 11,493 for a reset amount of 11,148 gallons.  So 22,641 gallons could have went into the car total, but it was stopped short. Tank level went from 15.24 – 12.11 before the loading was stopped, so 3.13 ft delta at 306 GPI.  So we loaded 11493 into the car. The total car capacity is 22018 gallons, minus the 460 gallon heel. The tank car could hold then 21,558 gallons.      22,546 gallons went out of VT-339 phenol loading tankand into a tank car with a capacity of 21,558, for an overflow amount of 988 gallons. This spill was a result of an overfill due to a calculation error made by the loader, this was not a result of any issues with the railcar or loading process.","A robust investigation was performed on this incident to identify root cause of the incident and what ""Mistake proof"" measures that can be implemented to prevent this type of spill in the future. The investigation identified 7 actions that are being taken to prevent going forward.  1. Engineering project implemented to install overflow protection that would prevent a spill if human error is made in loading calcuations.  2. Improved operating procedures- Railserve will be required to ensure all cars are uncoupled during the weighing process for accurate heel volume.   3. Update procedure for loaders - Shippers will be required to review scale tickets and record the heel vs calling on the phone to get heel verbally. Eliminates miscommunication of heel volume.  4. Update procedure on how to operate meter if it needs to be stopped in the middle of a load, explain details for each meter.  5. Update procedure if meter volume is accidentally cleared or power failure after loading has started. Car will be required to be re-weighed to determine how much volume is left in the car and how to reset meter to finish load without overfill.  6. Procedure updated on how to recalculate load volume for each meter style.  7. Update all railcar loading procedures on the above actions and train all loaders on the improved procedures.",Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,1300,Honeywell Frankford Plant,US,

DRIVER THEN CONNECTED TRANSFER HOSE FROM CARGO TRUCK DIESEL FUEL COMPARTMENT TO THE ABOVE-GROUND DIESEL STORAGE TANK AND BEGAN TRANSFERRING THE DIESEL FUEL. THE DRIVER THEN PROCEEDED TO RE-ENTER THE CAB OF THE ARGO TRUCK TO COMPLETE SOME PAPERWORK WHILE DIESEL FUEL WAS BEING TRANSFERRED. DUE TO THE SURROUNDING NOISE, THE DRIVER WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE STORAGE TANK WAS OVERFILLED UNTIL HE WAS ALERTED BY A HERTZ EMPLOYEE. THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THE TRANSFER PROCESS AND CONTACTED HIS OFFICE TO NOTIFY THEM OF THE RELEASE.    AT 0947 HOURS (CTZ) MR. TIRSO BELTRAN OF EMI RECEIVED A CALL FROM MR. ROBERT THORNTON (SAWOC) REQUESTING ASSISTANCE IN REGARDS TO THE RELEASE. 407 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL HAD BEEN RELEASED.

THE OUTFALL OF THE STORM DRAIN SYSTEM WAS LOCATED AND IT WAS OBSERVED THAT IT DISCHARGED INTO AN NAMELESS TRIBUTARY (CREEK) APPROXIMATELY 1/4 MILE FROM THE RELEASE SITE. SWS UTILIZED ABSORBENT BOOM, ABSORBENT PAD, AND CONSTRUCTED AN UNDERFLOW DAM TO CONTAIN THE DIESEL FUEL. ABSORBENT PAD UTILIZED TO RECOVER AS MUCH DIESEL FUEL AS POSSIBLE. A VACUUM TRUCK WAS ALSO UTILIZED TO RECOVER THE FUEL. THE STORM DRAIN SYSTEM WAS FLUSHED WITH COPIUS AMOUNTS OF WATER TO REMOVE THE DIESEL FUEL FROM THE STORM DRAIN SYSTEM. THE VACUUM TRUCK RECOVERED THE DIESEL FUEL AT THE UNDERFLOW DAM. APPROXIMATELY 275 TO 290 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL-WATER MIXTURE WAS RECOVERED. ABSORBENT BOOM WAS LEFT IN PLACE IN AREAS OF THE CREEK AND WOULD BE MONITORED PENDING THE NEXT RAIN EVENT.

After driver left, customer then stated that about 700 to 900 gallons spilled onto ground. There is no way because it would have taken 10 to 15 minutes for the driver to spill this much. I reported to NRC to be on the safe side. We have not heard back from the customer or anyone at the plant in reference to any cleanup or loss of product. Nor has our Insurance Carrier heard from anyone. We have learned that the customer has an uncapped loading hose that hangs out of the tank with no cutoff valve, and this possibly could be where they spilt the product after our driver left the plant.",Horizon Tank Lines trains all of our drivers in the handling of Hazardous Materials and require immediate notification of any spills.

FW 12688 was carefully moved to the facility's containment area. Contract responder's inspection of FW 12688 revealed one palletized 55 gallon steel drum (UN Specification 1A1/Y1.8/300/15/USA/NCCC) with a hazardous material label indicating a flammable liquid material was leaking from its bottom rolling hoop. It appeared that this drum had rubbed against an adjacent drum on the pallet resulting in a small hole/crack along the rolling hoop. These drums (three per pallet) were banded together on the pallet with shrink wrap that allowed drum movement during transit. The lading within FW 12688 had shifted towards the rear doorway indicating that blocking and bracing of the lading within FW 12688 was insufficient. The responders patched the hole in the leaking drum and placed it into an over-pack drum properly labeled. Spillage within FW 12688 was cleaned and all removed lading was returned inside FW 12688, blocked and braced for further over the road transportation. Appropriate placards were applied onto the exterior of FW 12688.   The SDS for this leaking commodity from the manufacturer (Bradley Coatings Group) indicated that this commodity is a hazardous material (UN 1263, Paint, Class 3, PG II) in transportation and this information was not passed to the BNSF at the time of initial rail transit by the shipper carrier (First West Express).     The responders also noted 'Corrosive Placards' laying atop drums inside FW 12688. They also observed drums and totes/IBCs of corrosive materials /disinfectant solutions inside FW 12688.

FW 12688 was carefully moved to the facility's containment area. Contract responder's inspection of FW 12688 revealed one palletized 55 gallon steel drum (UN Specification 1A1/Y1.8/300/15/USA/NCCC) with a hazardous material label indicating a flammable liquid material was leaking from its bottom rolling hoop. It appeared that this drum had rubbed against an adjacent drum on the pallet resulting in a small hole/crack along the rolling hoop. These drums (three per pallet) were banded together on the pallet with shrink wrap that allowed drum movement during transit. The lading within FW 12688 had shifted towards the rear doorway indicating that blocking and bracing of the lading within FW 12688 was insufficient. The responders patched the hole in the leaking drum and placed it into an over-pack drum properly labeled. Spillage within FW 12688 was cleaned and all removed lading was returned inside FW 12688, blocked and braced for further over the road transportation. Appropriate placards were applied onto the exterior of FW 12688.   The SDS for this leaking commodity from the manufacturer (Bradley Coatings Group) indicated that this commodity is a hazardous material (UN 1263, Paint, Class 3, PG II) in transportation and this information was not passed to the BNSF at the time of initial rail transit by the shipper carrier (First West Express).     The responders also noted 'Corrosive Placards' laying atop drums inside FW 12688. They also observed drums and totes/IBCs of corrosive materials /disinfectant solutions inside FW 12688.

Manway closure inspection revealed all six manway securement eyebolts were tool tight, but an audible vapor hiss was emanating from the manway closure. Inspection of the manway gasket condition revealed the applied nozzle gasket was partially torn/shredded, thus not providing a good seal. The deteriorated manway gasket was replaced by a new manway nozzle gasket. The manway closure was then properly secured. Afterwards, no further commodity odor or vapor hiss was detectable. Intact shipper seal TBS 271984 at the manway closure was replaced by seal BNSF 06157819. Response was concluded by 1345 hrs. PST, 2/03/2015.

At approximately 0315 hours a field operator discovered the car overflowing.  The field operator immediately stopped the loading operation and notified supervision.  Operations transferred Nadone Cyclohexanone from the containment sump to a holding tank and applied speedy dry to a gravel area that Nadone Cyclohexanone entered.  Operations washed down the area.  Nadone Cyclohexanone loading at Spot 17 was suspended until containment actions were in place.  The overflow resulted in an approximate 15 gallon Nadone spill into a gravel area near a containment sump.      The investigation found that the automatic transfer valve did not close as designed when the level reached its trip point and the load limit of the loading meter was met due to a frozen actuator.

The driver picked up the trailer on Saturday, February 7th at approximately 16:00 and then drove six hours north to Madawaska, ME.  The driver spent the night at the plant in preparation for his scheduled delivery on Sunday, February 8th at 09:00.  The temperature overnight was -20 degrees (factoring in wind chill) and there was no freeze protection available for the trailer.      When the truck and trailer were positioned into the unloading area, the driver was going to air unload the product, however when the internal and external valves were opened, the driver found the internal valve was frozen and no product was being off-loaded.   The driver disconnected the line and closed both the internal valve, external valve and moved the unit so that it could be steamed.      The driver opened the external valve and placed the steam line in the product line, in between the internal and external valve.  Steaming had to be accomplished this way as the product line is made of fiberglass.  If the steam line were placed on the outside of the product line it would have burned and damaged.    While the steaming was taking place the driver waited in a rail shed because of the extremely cold weather conditions.  Approximately 15 minutes later, the security guard notified the driver that product was spilling from the trailer.  The driver shut the internal valve.  The nearby drain was blocked with snow and prevented any further product to be in released into the plant’s waste treatment system.      It was determined that the spill occurred due to the driver failing to visually verify the internal valve was closed by inspecting the knob on the air-actuated valve.  The driver believed he had closed the internal valve before he moved the trailer to be steamed, but later it was discovered that when he opened the valve it allowed some frozen product to wedge itself underneath the open internal valve, not allowing it to close.","The driver did not follow company policy and FMCSR that he should always be in attendance monitoring trailer.  The driver was distracted by the extreme weather conditions.  He waited for the trailer to be steamed in the rail shed near the steam area, he did not maintain vision with the trailer.      The corrective action to prevent this type of release from reoccurring will entail the following:   • The details of the spill, root cause and corrective action will be sent out via Qualcomm message to the entire fleet of SBL. This is to remind all drivers of the hazards of leaving a vehicle unattended, a review of the company policy and the FMCSR.  It will show the importance of following their procedures of verifying securement especially when an unforeseen event or distraction takes place.    • The driver involved will complete the Pro-Tread lesson “Driver Distractions”   • The driver will complete re-training of company policy 13.4 unloading procedures.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Superior Bulk Logistis,US,

ABOUT 1 PINT OF PRODUCT LEAKED INTO THE SPILL BOX AND DRAIN LUBES CAUSING A SMALL AMOUNT OF HITEC 369 TO BE SPILLED ON THE CONCRETE ROADWAY AT THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD.   UPON THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD (UPRR) NOTICING THE LEAK THEY HAD THE DRIVER REPOSITION THE LOAD TO A LESS TRAVELEED AREA. THE UNION PACIFIC CONTACTED IEMA (IL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY) FOR THE HAZARDOUS SPILL. MIDWEST SYSTEMS DISPATCHED A MECHANIC TO THE UPRR FOR REPAIRS. UPON ARRIVAL THE MECHANIC FOUND THREE (3) NUTS ON THE BOTTOM SIPHON TUBE THAT WERE ONLY HAND TIGHT AND NOT SET TO THE PROPER TORQUE SETTINGS. HE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT ONE (1) NUT ON THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE WAS LOOSE AS WELL. TO IMMEDIATELY FIX THE ISSUE THE MECHANIC TORQUED DOWN ALL NUTS ON THE TANK. THE PRODUCT WAS CLEANED FROM THE TANK, SPILL BOX AND CHASSIS USING RAGS AND CITRUS CLEANER. THE SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT THE LEADED ONTO THE GROUND WAS ABSORBED USING PIG MAT. ANY REMAINING RESIDUE WAS CLEANED UP USING DRY SWEEP, RAGS AND CITRUS CLEANER. ALL WAS WAS REMOVED IN A 5 GALLON BUCKET BY IEMA FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.   ROOT CAUSE: PRIOR TO LOADING, ILIU140005-0 WAS PRESSURE TESTED TO ENSURE NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED. DURING THE TEST THE MECHANIC FAILED TO FOLLOW THE SOP AND SOAP TEST ALL OF THE FITTINGS ON TOP OF THE TANK.  DURING OUT GATE INSPECTION THE NUTS APPEARED TO BE TIGHT-HOWEVER, WITHOUT THE PROPER TORQUE SETTINGS PRODUCT LEAKED FROM THE FLANGE GASKETS.","In an effort to prevent future incidents all tank mechanics at Midwest Systems are required to review the SOP for pressure testing ISO tanks. During the test all valves and fittings will be soap tested at 1 BAR. This will include the bottom outlet valve, man lid, pressure relief valve, air inlet, blind flanges, and top discharged valve (if equipped). Failure to company with SOP will result in disciplinary measure ranging from suspension to termination. Midwest Systems has also created a new pressure test sheet.

UTLX 200316 was cordoned-off in the railyard. BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders immediately inspected UTLX 200316.  The responders reported finding the leak source at the liquid valve's threaded connection. The liquid valve was not tool tight (hand tight only) on its threaded connection which allowed commodity to escape at this threaded area. The liquid valve was properly tool tightened which ended any further commodity release. Non-evaporated spillage was wiped.   The BNSF employee that reported UTLX 200316 emanating commodity odors complained of inhalation exposure from the commodity vapors from UTLX 200316.

Norfolk Southern dispatched HEPACO, an emergency response contractor, to investigate the problem. HEPACO found no fire when they arrived.  The response time for HEPACO was about 2 hours.  The car was tested with an infra red thermometer gun.  No highly elevated temperatures were noted.  HEPACO personnel applied a 0-200psi pressure gauge to the car.  The pressure in the car was not high enough to move the gauge.  HEPACO utilized a four gas meter to test LEL levels around the man-way and valves for any leak source.  No readings were noted.  Norfolk Southern requested HEPACO inspect the relief valve and open the man-way to check for damage to the gasket.  When HEPACO began venting the pressure from the car through the vapor line the four gas meter indicated carbon monoxide at levels up to 650ppm indicating a fire may have occurred inside the car.  Once depressurized, the man-way was opened.  The gasket was found to have wear but intact.  HEPACO personnel found no fire but reported what appeared to be soot on the interior of the man-way lid and nozzle.      Norfolk Southern placed a Hazmat Hold on the tank car and ordered laboratory sampling by a third party be conducted on the tank interior and its contents to test for signs of combustion.  The forensic analysis of those samples indicated a fire did occur inside of tank car SHPX206604.  A copy of that report is attached to this 5800.    The car was also inspected by representatives of Union Tank Car, the car owner American Railcar Leasing.","The information obtained from this incident has been forwarded to the car owner, the AAR Tank Car Committee and the Renewable Fuels Association for further study.",No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7500,Norfolk Southern Railway Company,US,

DALTON,RISK MANAGEMENT SUPERVISOR,300 Lionville Station Road,Chester Springs,PA,19425,Carrier,"Driver of vehicle ran over curb and large rock with left axles of trailer which caused center of gravity for product in tank to shift causing a rollover. The shell of one compartment developed a crack and was leaking onto the asphalt driveway at a slow rate.  Driver placed a bucket under release but not before approx. 60 to 120 gallons was spilled. (There was a small amount of gas left on the trailer that could not be pumped over.) Absorbent pads and pigs were also used until a cleanup contractor arrived on site. There was no contact/drainage of the product into any drains, sewers, or waterways.  Each compartment was drilled to allow the pump-out to another trailer for delivery elsewhere. The trailer was then righted using several tow rigs.  Tractor & trailer where held for inspection by PA State Police but release several days later with no issues found. Video was available and viewed by management. A check of the on board recording device revealed the tractor was moving at 5 mph. On rollover the shear forces involved pulled the fifth wheel plate and mounts free of the tractor frame leaving the tractor upright. The inspection by the State Police & company revealed no defects of the fifth wheel plate or pin. Any remedial actions needed are to be handled by the spill contractor performing tests to determine ground and asphalt contamination. Samples are to be taken at site so there will likely be additional costs for spill remediation not shown on this report.

Upon inspection of the trailer, employee noticed one of the totes leaking from dump valve at bottom of IBC.  The material was transferred to a new IBC.  While inspecting the valve on the IBC that leaked, it was noted that the gasket on the valve cap was damaged and misaligned.  It was also noted that debris inside the vall valve had prevented the valve from fully closing. Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the contents into a suitable IBC container. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and placed into the salvage drum.

The road crosses over the Chikaskia river with a bridge known as Gun Barrel bridge. As you pass over the bridge the road slopes down into a valley. The road in this valley was extremely muddy. According to the tire tracks, the driver was directing the vehicle at a slight angle compared to the road. That angle would cause him to run off the road around 150yards post bridge unless he corrected. It shows that the driver did not correct his trajectory until his steer tires were around 2 feet from the right edge of the road. As he turned his steer tires the momentum of the vehicle on the muddy road caused him to continue straight. This resulted in the tractor departing the roadway on the right and tipping onto the passenger side. As the vehicle came to rest on the its passenger side, a small amount of clear diesel (2gal) leaked from the saddle tank of the tractor. No product was released from the trailer.",Employees qualifications have been reviewed and has been let go / Incident will be discussed in detail in March's safety meeting / Continual integration of the Smith System training,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,77697,Pilot Thomas Logistics,US,

Customer failed to have its employee in attendance during offloading to ensure a proper offloading, contrary to this customer's established procedure.  After the connection to the hard pipe only, the CMV operator returned to the rear of the cargo tanker and opened the valve to offload product through the line.  However, one end of the transfer system (flex hose combined with hard pipe) remained unattached.  This caused product to flow out of the pipe to the ground. Less than thirty (30) seconds after offloading began, the CMV operator visually observed spill occurring and immediately shut off the flow of product from the cargo tanker.  The CMV operator failed to notify anyone of the event.  The customer became aware of the spill after CMV operator left customer premises; customer reported that some of the product discharged to the customer's property causing damage to the property.","A) CMV operator suspended, and upon return to work from suspension, was demoted as well as placed on probation for six (6) months.

Carrier was traveling north on US 271 going approximately 45 mph. As the carrier approached the intersection of N. Point Pleasant Rd, a vehicle driven by Lane Buchanan was being chased by East Mountain police north on N. Point Pleasant Rd at a high rate of speed. Mr. Buchanan's vehicle struck the Carrier's trailer at the intersection of US 271 and N. Point Pleasant Rd. It is estimated Mr. Buchanan's vehicle was traveling in excess of 90 mph at time of accident. Mr. Buchanan's vehicle slid under the trailer, destroying all of the pipes, fittings, valves and pump on the trailer. Mr. Buchanan's vehicle continued out the other side of the trailer and struck another vehicle that was traveling south on US 271. Mr. Buchanan died shortly after the incident from injuries suffered in the crash. Police and emergency personnel were on scene in seconds due to the active police chase.  KHP Global immediately dispatched our local operations manager and called a local remediation company (OMI) - both arrived on scene within 45-60 minutes. OMI immediately stopped the leakage from the trailer due to the damaged valves, and commenced a remediation of the site. It is estimated that no more than 20 barrels of crude oil were spilled on the roadway and side of road - all of which was cleaned up within 24-48 hrs after incident. The insurance company's remediation specialist (Cura Emergency Services), continues to work with TxDOT and TX Commission on Environmental Quality to ensure full clean up of site.","There was nothing that could have been done to avoid this incident, or improve or prepare for response. The company responded as fast as possible considering the remote location of the crash, and what could easily have been a complete loss of 175 barrels was mitigated to less than 20 barrels by the fast actions of the mitigation team on site.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,131500,KHP Global Inc dba Veteran Energy Transport,US,

THE TOTAL CAPACITY PER THE MANUFACTURE OF THE TANK IS 3500 GALLONS HOWEVER THE METERED GALLONS OFF-LOADED WERE 3530 GALLONS. THE REASON FOR THE OVERAGE IS DUE TO THE MANUAL FILL OF THE 4 COMPARTMENT TANK. THE TANKS HAVE A ""MARKER"" INSIDE THAT ACTS AS A FILL GUIDELINE. IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE TOTAL PUT INTO THE TRUCK WAS NO MORE THEN 3550 GALLONS LEAVING US TO BELIEVE THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF 20 GALLONS CAME FORM THE CARGO TANK.

BECAUSE HE WAS ON A LATER STOP, THE TOTAL GALLONS CARRIED IN THE TRUCK AT THAT TIME WAS ONLY ABOUT 700, AS HE HAD ALREADY DISPENSED THE REST OF IT AT OTHER STOPS. WHILE HE WAS FUELING A TANK, HE SAW WHAT LOOKED IN THE DARK LIKE SMOKE AND HEARD A NOISE COMING FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF HIS TRUCK. HE QUICKLY SHUT OFF THE NOZZLE AND RAN TO THE TRUCK TO DISCOVER WAS LOOKED LIKE ""SMOKE"" WAS ACTUALLY A SPRAY OF FUEL COMING FROM THE PTO (POWER TAKE OFF), WHICH IS THE POWER/MOTOR FOR FUEL DISPENSING. HE TURNED OFF THE PTO AND THE TRUCK AND ACTED QUICKLY AND CREATIVELY AND RETRIEVED A LARGE PIECE OF STYROFOAM TO USE AS A CATCH BASIN COVER. HE FOLLOWED THE PATH THE FUEL WOULD TAKE AND COVERED THE CATCH BASIN AND DAMNED THE LIQUID PRODUCT WITH ABSORBENT PADS HE HAD. IT HAD BEEN RAINING SHORTLY BEFORE THE RELEASE BUT WAS NOT RAINING AT THE TIME ENOUGH TO CAUSE FLOW. BECAUSE THE STYROFOAM WASN'T LIQUID TIGHT TO THE CATCH BASIN, SOME FUEL TRICKLED IN SLOWLY, BUT HIS COVER KEPT A GOOD MAJORITY FROM ENTERING THE BASIN. ALSO, ALL FUEL THAT HAD ENTERED THE BASIN REMAINED THERE, AS THE OUTFLOW PIPE WAS ABOVE THE LIQUID LEVEL IN THE BASIN. AFTER CONTAINMENT, APP DRIVER NOTIFIED APP DISPATCH, WHO NOTIFIED APP'S HSSE MANAGER TARYN MILLER WHO RESPONDED TO SCENE. HSSE MANAGER SPOKE WITH APP DRIVER, WHO INDICATED HE ESTIMATED THE SPILL WAS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO ABOUT 30 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL. HE HAD NO WAY TO CONFIRM THIS, HOWEVER, AS THE SPILL DID NOT OCCUR FORM THE LINE WHERE HE WAS METERING FUEL FROM. WHILE EN ROUTE TO SCENE TARYN MILLER DISPATCHED NRC ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, APP'S CLEAN-UP CONTRACTOR. ON ARRIVAL TO SCENE, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THE TRUCK WAS STILL LEAKING FUEL (A BUCKET PLACED  UNDERNEATH BY DRIVER WAS CONTAINING IT), AND WE WOULD NEED APP'S ON-CALL MECHANIC TO RESPOND AS WELL. CALLS WERE THEN MADE TO NOTIFY REGULATORY AGENCIES ABOUT THE INCIDENT. TARYN MILLER FIRST CALLED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (REPORT# 107754), THEN THE WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (REPORT# 15-0490), WHO INDICATED THAT THE WASHINGTON DEPARTMENT OF ECOLOGY ON-CALL SPILL RESPONSE PARTY WOULD BE NOTIFIED AND WOULD RETURN THE CALL. THE ECOLOGY REPRESENTATIVE CALLED BACK SHORTLY AFTER AND REQUESTED INFORMATION ABOUT CLEAN-UP. WE CONFIRMED TO THEM THAT NRC ENVIRONMENTAL WAS EN ROUTE FOR CLEAN-UP AND THAT FROM WHAT WE WOULD TELL EVERYTHING WAS CONTAINED WITHING THE SINGLE CATCH BASIN.  HE SAID HE WOULD CALL BACK IF THEY NEEDED TO MAKE A SITE VISIT, BUT WE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ELSE THAT EVENING.  APP LEAD MECHANIC GARY HARPER ARRIVED AND WORKED ON THE TRUCK TO STOP THE LEAK.  HE DRAINED THE PLUMBING LINE ATTACHED TO THE PTO AND MADE ADJUSTMENTS SO THAT IT WOULD NOT LEAK ANYMORE AND TRUCK COULD BE DRIVEN BACK TO APP'S YARD IN TACOMA, WA FOR REPAIRS.  HE INDICATED LATER THAT THE SPILL WAS CAUSED BY A WARPED FLANGE ON T","WITH INCIDENT BEING CAUSED BY EQUIPMENT FAILURE, THERE ISN'T A LOT WE CAN DO. WE ALREADY HAVE A THOROUGH INSPECTION PROCESS FOR THE TRUCKS WHEN THEY ARE IN FOR SERVICE. OUR SHOP NOW KNOWS TO LOOK FOR THE TYPE OF WARPING WE SAW ON THIS TRUCK IN FUTURE INSPECTIONS. DRIVER, WHO REVEIVES HAZWOPER TRAINING ANNUALLY, ACTED QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY IN STOPPING PRODUCT FLOW AND CONTAINING THE SPILL, PREVENTING THIS SPILL FROM BECOMING LARGER THAN IT WAS.

TO BETTER EXPLAIN, IMAGINE THE HOSE FROM THE DANCO TANKER GOING INTO THE ROLFSON API HOOK-UP.  FROM THERE, THE FUEL GOES UP AND AROUND TO FLOW INSIDE OF THE ROLFSON TANK AND INTO THEIR LOADING TUBE, WHICH IS UP IN THE AIR HIGH ENOUGH TO GO OVER TRUCKS AND USED TO FILL SMALLER TANKS FORM THE LARGE TANK DANCO WAS FILLIN UP.  THE PROBLEM WAS THE SHUT-OFF ON THE END OF THE LOADING TUBE WAS LEFT OPEN (LIKE THE END OF A GARDEN HOSE WITH THE SPRAYER SQUEEZED OPEN WHEN YOU TURN ON THE SPIGOT AND WATER SPRAYS EVERYWHERE!).  WHEN ANYONE OPENS A VALVE OR SHUT-OFF OF ANY TYPE, ANYWHERE, THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLOSING IT. ALSO, THAT LOAD TUBE IS HIGH UP A SET OF PORTABLE, METAL STAIRS THAT DANCO DRIVERS DO NOT USE OR TOUCH.  THE DANCO DRIVER THEN CALLED DISPATCH AND SPOKE TO SHAWN DUNCAN (A DISPATCHER WHO IS NO LONGER AN EMPLOYEE WITH DANCO) TO REPORT THE SPILL AND THEN CALLED ROLFSON TO TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED.  AT THE TIME, ROLFSON SAID THE SPILL WAS NOT A BIG DEAL. SHAWN DUNCAN WAS TASKED TO COMPLETE THIS INCIDENT REPORT BUT DID NOT DO SO BEFORE LEAVING DANCO.  THE DANCO OWNERS BELIEVED THE INCIDENT REPORT WAS COMPLETED AND TURNED IN UNTIL GAIL TWITTY (DOT) CONTACTED JODI GERADS (OWNER) TO SAY THE INCIDENT REPORT WAS NEVER RECEIVED. I WAS BROUGHT ON BOARD 2 WEEKS AGO TO ADDRESS THIS (AND ANY OTHER DOT NEEDS IN THE FUTURE), CREATE DRIVER TRAINING MANUALS INCLUDING PROACTIVE SAFETY MEASURES, ALONG WITH GENERAL OPERATIONS AND FUNCTIONS.  I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS NOT GETTING TO YOU SOONER AND HOPE YOU CAN GIVE US A CHANCE TO GET THIS RIGHT. THIS LACK OF REPORTING IN A TIMELY MANNER WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.","UNFORTUNATELY, DANCO DRIVERS ARE NOT REALLY ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTIONS TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF RECURRENCE. THE MOST WE CAN DO IS RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT ROLFSON UPDATE THEIR TRAINING PROCEDURES TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THAT SHUT-OFF ON THE LOADING TUBE BE CHECKED AFTER USE TO MAKE SURE IT IS CLOSED/OFF. IF THIS IS ALREADY MENTIONED IN THEIR PROCEDURES THEN CREATING A DOUBLE-CHECK WITHIN THOSE PROCEDURES MAY BE WARRANTED. IT IS ILLOGICAL TO ASK A DANCO DRIVER TO CLIMB THOSE RISERS TO CHECK THAT SHUT-OFF ON THE LOADING TUBE.  IT IS A ROLFSON FACILITY AND A ROLFSON RESPONSIBILITY.    WITH REGARDS TO THIS INCIDENT REPORT, QUESTION 25, IN PART III WAS DIFFICULT TO COMPLETE BASED ON THIS SITUATION.  THE ONLY FAILURE WAS HUMAN-RELATED ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  NOTHING MECHANICAL FAILED SO ADDING ""HUMAN FAILURE"" MAY NEED TO BE ADDED TO THE ""WHAT FAILED:"".",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,403500,DANCO TRANSPORT,US,
