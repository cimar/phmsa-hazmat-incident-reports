When he called he said that he was inspecting cars so they could be put into Marathon Oil for loadig.  When inspecting these cars he noticed a gas odor coming from this car.  He called me and I was on the scene in about 15 minutes.  I inspected the car and determined that the PRD was leaking a small amount of vapor.  I tried to reset the spring loaded valve by tapping on it with a brass hammer and the valve would not seal.  I eneded up taking the PRD apart and replaced the two O rings that were inside.  When reinstalled I checked again for leaks and the leak was repaired.  The car was then released to go back to Marathon for loading.

Of the original 9 gallons within the container, Triumvirate’s spill response personnel estimate that approximately 4 gallons of the original contents of the drum leaked out while the drum was in transit.    At approximately 18:15, when the vehicle arrived at a refueling station after a hazardous waste pickup, Triumvirate personnel observed that a small trickle of liquid was dripping from the front corner of the box truck.   Triumvirate staff members ascertained the potential hazards in the back of the truck by examining the hazardous waste manifest, donned Level C personal protection equipment, and climbed in to the rear of the truck to identify the source of the liquid.  The leaking container was quickly identified: a reconditioned steel waste container (1A1/X1.4/250/06/USA/SDCC), one drum of the two that were shipped.  The leaking drum had been securely stacked for shipment atop the other identical, non-leaking container.    Upon inspection, a stream of liquid was clearly flowing from a small “pinhole” leak in the underside of the drum along the seam, directly adjacent to the lip.   The drum was lifted and deposited into a larger 30 gallon open head, steel drum to contain the leak. All other drums and materials on the truck where removed and all surfaces that had come into contact with the free liquid where decontaminated with rags and biodegradable cleaning material. The floor surface of the box truck was decontaminated in the same manner, using rags and the same cleaning material. The spill response team confirmed that no other container in the truck was leaking.    Triumvirate staff verified that the waste container did not show any signs of leakage at the time that the container was loaded on to the truck, at approximately 16:45.  Concluding that the leak must have begun during transit, the responders began to inspect the truck for any possible causes of the leak.  No sharp protrusions in the truck were detected, nor were the responders able to determine that the container held any incompatible materials that may have corroded the drum.  Unable to clearly identify the cause of the leak, Triumvirate staff conjectured that the reconditioned container’s integrity had become weakened at some point and began to leak at the weakest spot of the container (the seam on the underside) during the stresses of transportation.","Recommendations  Triumvirate Environmental takes great efforts to purchase and supply only high quality waste containers, but occasionally hazardous waste generators offer their own waste containers for shipment on Triumvirate trucks.  Triumvirate employees are instructed to verify that all hazardous waste containers bear DOT-approved markings prior to shipment, but Triumvirate shall instruct employees to more thoroughly inspect any waste containers that Triumvirate Environmental has not supplied.    The offeror of this waste was notified of the situation and asked by Triumvirate to inspect their shipping container inventory for any potential defects.  Triumvirate also asked the offeror to re-evaluate their selection process for selecting proper shipping containers.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Triumvirate Environmental, Incorporated",US,

Shipper contract responders inspected EXFU 380118 observing a very small pool of liquid under the discharge valve's safety/dust cap. This valve's (foot) handle was exercised and cycled to ensure that it was closing the valve fully. The valve's safety cap was slowing unscrewed. A small amount of product was found inside the cap. The cap and the valve were wiped clean. All ground spillage was also wiped. Teflon tape was applied to all threaded areas and the safety cap was applied and tool tightened. No further product drips were observed afterwards. Inspection also revealed that the top hatchway was not fully secured. Two of the eight swing bolts were not applied and hanging down. The responders applied the loose swing bolts and tightened all swing bolts with their corresponding wing nuts. Also, one placard was missing on the left side of EXFU 380118 and a new Flammable Liquid placard was applied. The shipper was notified to reinspect EXFU 380118 to ensure that the discharge valve was working properly.

At the comclusion of the loading process, the equipment operator shut the valve on the storage tank and the valve on the cargo tank after bleeding hose used to transfer the material.  During this operation, it was discoverd that the scrubber unit associated with the pump used to load the material had overfilled and allowed a small amount of material to escape from the exhaust stack of the scrubber system.  Approximatley 1 quart of material was released onto the side of the tank and the fender of the vehicle.  The equipment operator immediatley turned the pump off and used absorbent pads to collect the material that had escaped.  He then proceeded to drain the scrubber unit and placed this residual material into the tank.  The absorbant pads were containerized and placed into storage pending disposal to a licensed waste management facility.","AN investigation into the release determined that the material being loaded has a tendency to foam during the loadig process.  As this material is loaded using a mechanical pump, the scrubber system used in conjunction with the pump migrated from the scrubber's exhaust tank and escaped from the exhaust stack.  It was determined that the release would have been prevented had the equipment operator inspected and drained the scrubber system on a more frequent basis while the loading operation was being performed.  In order to prevent a recurrence, a step-by step proccedure has been developed  for this product stream that oulines the steps needed to be taken to insure appropriate steps are taken during the loaidng process to prevent the build-up of excess foam in the scrubber system.

The area around the rail car was isolated and Chemtrec (report number 2008-05-21-00247) assisted in contacting the shipper, Equistar Chemicals.  Hepaco, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the connection of the threaded liquid line valve to the tank car less than tool tight. Contractor personnel removed the valve, added teflon tape to the threaded connection, then reinstalled the fitting and properly secured the valve body tool tight.  Since the car no longer complied with DOT specifications, the shipper, Equistar, applied for a FRA Movement Approval.  Upon receiving notice of approval (FRA-08050158) the car was released to destination. Approximately 10 gallons was released from the container.

Due to a possible load shift, one (1) 275-gallon tote of Stabrom 909 Biocide (UN3266) developed a pinhole leak approximately 5-8 inches below the top of the tote.  This released approximately 25 gallons of product onto the trailer floor, parking area and soil shoulder of the parking area.    An emergency response team was dispatched to the site.  Upon arrival at the site, the response team was able to stop the leak by plugging the pinhole with a plug & dike product.  The response team applied granular sorbents to clean up the impacted areas of the roadway and trailer.  All totes were removed from the trailer, placed on plastic and decontaminated.  Once the totes were decontaminated they were reloaded into the trailer.  The load was properly blocked and braced for transport.   The response then excavated approximately 4 yards of impacted soil.  All waste was disposed at a permitted facility","Due to a possable load shift being the cause of this event, better blocking and braceing should be completed prior to transport.  Additionally, the load should be doubled check to be assured that is is stable for tansport.",No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,11000,"American Compliance Technologies, Inc.",US,

They were traveling in a convoy fashion and had to make a right turn from State Hwy 65N to County Rd, (E. Mountain). As the employee approached the turn onto the county road,he failed to realize that it required a wide swing out due to the ditch adjacent to the roadway and the narrow road to which they were turning. As the employee made the turn, the trailer was off the pavement and was going through the edge of the ditch, which was about 3 feet deep. As the employee noticed the trailer going through the ditch, he attempted to stop, at which time the loaded tanker began to lean and laid over in a slow motion roll. The contents of the tank began to leak slightly around one of the domes in the top of the tank. The members of the crew had been trained in Hazardous Materials Emergency Response in accordance with OSHA 29 CFR 191 0.120 (q)(6)(iii) HazWOPER. The crew quickly secured the dome and the result was a minimal release of 20 gallons of 15% HCL. The ditch in which the HCL was now in was diked and the product was contained. The supervisor on the scene immediately contacted the safety department and a emergency response clean-up contractor was dispatched to the scene. The scene was cleaned up in accordance with local, state and federal guidelines and the waste materials were properly disposed of through an approved hazardous waste disposal facility. The release appeared to be the result of the torque that had been applied to the tank as it rolled over and not to any design or container failure. The dome lid was slightly twisted which caused the leak. The crew tightened a couple of the bolts to the dome lid and stopped the leak. The product leakage was only a short duration","We have implemented a program to ensure that all vehicles in the convoy are equipped with two-way radio communications and will be relaying details of the road conditions as we travel. We have also mandated that any employee driving a unit transporting Hazardous Materials must have a minimum of 1 year of service with the company and must be re-certified every three months to transport Hazardous Materials for the first year of their initial certification. We have a library of the road hazards, including tight turns, and will review the Road Hazard Assessments with the employees during training sessions.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,65100,,US,

The release seems to have originated from the dome lid as the driver noticed materials leaking down the side of the tank as well as contained within the crash box.  The leaked material has impacted an area of asphalt and no soils, storm drains, or surface waters have been impacted as a result of this release.      The driver has suspected that he may have a defective gasket.     An ERTS network contractor has been dispatched with an ETA of 45 minutes.     NJDEP has been notified and has assigned report number 080517130601 to this incident.   NRC has been notified of this release.  No incident report has been generated at this time.   It has been determined that the pressure relief valve is the cause of the release.  It seems that the aluminum flange has been damaged.     The tanker has been taken back to the shipper for repairs and reevaluation.        The contractor is utilizing sodium bicarbonate on the affected area as well as large amounts of water to neutralize the material.",,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3000,Emergency Response and Training Solutions,US,

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders immediately inspected GATX 13352. The responders reported finding the threaded vapor valve two full turns loose and the liquid valve's closure plug one turn loose. After securement of the aforementioned, the product odor was still present. The responders detected the odor source emanating from the base flange of the liquid valve. All four flange nuts were tool tightened but the odor persisted.

At the time of the release the tank trailer was being delivered to an interlined motor carrier’s terminal to be stored for future transportation to a customer’s site.  Upon arrival at the interline carriers terminal, which is located approximately 1 mile from the shipper’s location, the driver observed some material being released from the rear dome of the tank trailer.  The driver immediately moved the vehicle to a safe and leveled location at the carrier’s terminal, shut off the equipment, and initiated company emergency response procedures.  An in-house emergency response crew arrived to the scene within minutes to asses the situation.  The response crew reviewed the shipping papers and determined the appropriate emergency response procedures.  Following appropriate health and safety practices the response crew utilized appropriate neutralizers and absorbent materials to clean up the released materials on the ground and the tank trailer.   All of the resulting absorbent was collected and placed into appropriate containers for future disposal at a fully license waste disposal facility.  The release of approximately 25 gallons of material was confined to the fully contained paved parking area with no offsite impact.  The clean up operation was completed by 10:00pm with no further incidents.","An in depth incident review was conducted following this incident to identify the cause and determine if any corrective actions were warranted.  Our investigation determined that the tank trailer used for this shipment was a baffled trailer with three separate dome hatches for each baffled compartment.  The standard tank trailers historically used by this shipper are only equipped with one dome hatch in the center of the tank trailer.  The loaders at the site are trained to properly secure all of the tank truck opening prior to offering a shipment for transportation.  However, the loading rack utilized by the shipping location only permits safe access to the center dome and does not provide fall protection to the loaders to access any other openings.  Because the loaders could not safely access any of the domes not in the center of the trailer, the domes were not checked for proper closure.  An assumption was made that the tank trailer provider ensured that all of the tank truck openings were securely fastened prior to the tank being delivered for loading.  As a result of this investigation, the shipper will request that when possible only trailers equipped with one center dome-hatch be used for shipments from this location.  In the instances where the availability of preferred trailers is limited, the tank provider will be asked to verify and ensure that all tank trailer openings that will not be utilized by the shipper are securely fastened and secured prior to the tank’s arrival to the shipping site.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Rohm and Haas Company,US,

Due to rain in the area, the release was washed across a parking lot and settled into puddles of standing rain water.  No storm drains or waterways were impacted by the release.  A contractor was dispatched to the site to conduct remediation activities.  They began by pH testing the puddles and impacted asphalt.  Then the contractor utilized absorbent pads to remove the caustic rain water from the puddles and remove the material from the asphalt surface.  Once the puddles were drained, the contractor hand excavated some impacted soil from the bottom of the puddles.  After the material was removed from the area, the contractor neutralized the impacted area.

The outbound train was stopped and TCIX 21075 was carefully setout of this train and isolated in the railyard awaiting further inspection. BNSF contract responders inspected TCIX 21075 and reported that the liquid eduction valve pipe riser with a four bolt flange was leaking between the valve and the riser at the flange gasket. No suitable replacement gasket was readily available and responders secured the leakage area with flange plug at the riser and temporarily secured the valve assembly with poly-coated Tyvek tape. Contractors planned to return with a suitable replacement gasket. Spillage was neutralized with a soda ash solution. Afterwards, a shipper response team applied a new flange gasket and secured the liquid eduction line/valve assembly of TCIX 21075 making it ready for transportation. On the morning of 5/20/08, the BNSF contractor returned with a replacement gasket and discovered the TCIX 21075 had already undergone repairs.    On 5/25/08, at the BNSF North Fort Worth (TX) railyard, TCIX 21075 was again reported leaking product from the liquid eduction line/valve area. TCIX 21075 was inspected by BNSF contract responders whom reported that the four flange bolts at the liquid eduction valve pipe riser were loose and their corroded condition prevented these flange bolts to be fully tool tightened. Responders reported that the flange gasket appeared to be new and correctly applied. Spillage estimated at less than one quart product liquid was neutralized. TCIX 21075 remained isolated and motionless in the railyard until these flange bolts could be replaced. On 5/29/08, a shipper contract tank car repair response team with assistance from the BNSF contract responder replaced and properly tool tightened all flange bolts. TCIX 21075 was released to proceed to its destination after no further leakage was observed.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,3760,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The load was picked up at PCS Nitrogen in Augusta, GA and enroute to Austin Powder Company in Dunlap, TN.  At approx. the 164 mile marker on I-20 headed west, the driver spotted a deer in his lane of travel, which was the inside lane.  In an attempt to avoid the deer, the driver swerved to his left into the median.  When htried to return to his proper lane of travel, the tractor and trailer overturned onto the left side of the unit.  At that time, the tarp covering of the trailer failed, releasing the bulk load of ammonium nitrate.  It is unclear at this time whether or not that the weight of the material caused the tarp to fail, or if it was the abrasive action of the pavement on the tarp which caused the failure.","It is reccomennded that further training be given to the drivers, and this driver in particular, on accident avoidence and emergency manuvers.  In accident avoidance, the drivers will be instructed to lower their speeds during night driving, to keep an eye out for animals in the median and shoulder of the road, and to slow down when spotted as there is an increasd chance of animals in the road when they are spotted in the median or shoulder of the road.  In emergency manuvers the drivers will be instructed to come to a complete stop if the emergency manuver places them off the roadway to reduce the chances of a rollover.  Also, the drivers will be instructed to not try to attempt emergency manuvers if presented with a similar situation, since the damage to the truck from striking an animal would be minimal verses a rollover.

The leak was small but continuous. The driver called his dispatch to report the leak. Dispatch called Univar Export Services to report that their driver had discovered a leak. The local fire department and local responders SWS First Response were contacted immediately and sent out to respond to the leak. SWS arrived on the scene at 3:40 PM and proceeded with cleanup efforts. At 4:15 pm SWS had completed the cleanup. There was no physical or environmental damage. The package had a very small pin-sized hole at the lower 3rd hoop. The drum lost 10 lbs of product so the duration of the leak was minimal and at best only about 7 or 8 hours (including the time at the truck stop). The driver created a small burm with sand until the response team arrived on scene.","After carefull and detailed review of the damage to the drum in question, we have concluded that the leak was caused by operator error. The drum sustained moderate damage to the lower 3rd section at the hoop. The lower hoop was creased which in turn developed a small crack or pinhole allowing product to escape at a very slow rate. Due to improper handling of the drums while loading, the operator damaged the drum that eventually leaked. It appears that the damaged drum was struck by another drum being loaded causing moderate damage.     The operator has been properly trained and is a very experienced loader. Our team feels that the operator was in a rush to load the truck due to the heavy workload we have been experiencing.     After reviewing our drum loading procedures we determined them to be sufficient. All containers are inspected prior to loading. The inspection includes checking the van floors for nails, screws and anything that could cause damage to freight. The drums are inspected for leaks/damage/cleanliness/labeling/marks prior to loading. Upon completion of the loading process, we look for any signs of product leaks before releasing the load for transport. All vans are sealed by the loaded with a high security bolt seal. The seal number is recorded on the bil of lading.     The equipment used for the loading process are a forklift and drum handlers. All equipment used is in excellent condition. The operator has been trained to use them properly. The operator rushed the loading process which in turn directly caused improper handing of the drums being loaded.     Our response to the incident was excellent condering it's location was not near any of our facilities. We dispatched SWS First Response to perform the cleanup. After Pompano received both the damaged drum and the transfer drum, we found that 10 pounds of material was lost.    The operator shall receive refresher training on how to properly load drums on a van using drum handling equipment. The speed at which the loading is performed will also be addressed.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1592,"Univar USA, INC.",US,

Because the truck was not in gear the engine brake was inoperable, the drive train could not beused to slow the vehicle and only the brakes remained as a stopping device. They overheated rapidly because of the vehicle speed and weight and failed. The driverfailed to use the run away ramp and collided with 3 cars waiting at a traffic signal at the bottom of the hill. One collision broke the steering axel suspension on the truck causing the truck to turn right and rollover.

The BP driver safely pulled the truck over to the shoulder of the road, and the motorist pulled over with him. They both approached the truck and the motorist pointed out to the driver what the problem was. The BP driver found the rear compartment drop tube was leaking product from the under side. He immediately got a bucket from the trailer and put it under the leaking pipe. He then got spill pads and began laying them down around the bucket.  He then called the tech at the terminal to report the problem and ask him to call the fire department. The BP driver when back to the trailer and found a piece of wood and whittled it down to make a plug and with a spill pad pushed in the hole to stop the leaking pipe. At that time the fire department arrived and layed kitty litter down a round the bucket and used sealant putty on the leaking pipe to further stop the leaking pipe. At around 3:30pm I and two terminal employees arrived that the site. We begin draining the pipe in to two 5 gallon buckets and transferring them to gas cans. After we fully drained the drop tube we put spill pads in side the drop valve pushing them up in to the pipe were the pipe was damaged.

Upon unloading the tote from Bob's trailer after his return to the UBG Service Center, DSR Richard Flom noticed a small amount of liquid seeping out from around the cap and collecting on the top of the tote whenever the tote was moved due to the material inside sloshing and the fact that the top cap is not properly sealed. Richard reported the leak immediately and we notified ExxonMobil of the problem. When they did not take immediate action to repair the leaking tote, we went ahead and notified Chemtrek and Nalco as well as Mike Sorensen. The tote does not leak as long as it's stationary Nalco then dispatched their local contractor who came to our location and attempted to repair the tote as well as cleaning up and disposing of the small amount of liquid that had previously leaked out. The contractors tried to tighten the cap on the tote, but upon moving it we determined that it was still leaking. They then told usthat someone from Exxon would be contacting us, as the gasket in the lid would have to be replaced or the material would have to be moved to another container.The contractors did not have an extra gasket in their posesssion.

Driver arrived at the store and stuck the tank at 37 inches (3178 gallons) in a 12,000 gallon tank. He was supposed to drop 3900 NL. He hooked up his vapor recovery then started his 2800 gallon compartment. About 10 to 15 minutes into the drop the hose jumped as if the tank was full. The driver shut down the product and  then noticed that product was bubbling up from the Spill containment area. It filled the spill containment area and started to run out onto the concrete. He tried to contain spill with spill pads but product kept bubbling up from spill well. He walked the hose down to assure it was empty and wanted to cap the tank to try and stop the product from flowing out of the tank. He removed the fittingwith the hose still attached, when he did the gas from the tank sprayed. He got the cap onto the tank but product was still coming out of the tank. By this time the fire department showed up and took over the scene. They sprayed foam over the area and onto the soil behind the drop without having a barrier to stop any of the gas water or foam. The tank had plenty of room for the entire 3900 nl to fit but would not take even 2800 nl. There is no reason why this tank would have this kind of back pressure especially if there was more that 4800 gallons of room before 90%.",NP Spill caused by backpressure in customer UST.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,,,

The driver over-corrected, causing the truck to overturn at Appling and Southern Way. The truck was carrying 8,500 gallons of unleaded gas. Gasoline escaped from the dome cover on one compartment. Approximately 500 gallons were released to the roadway: the remaining gasoline on the truck was transferred to another truck. The driver was not hurt in the accident.    TN EMA contacted - assigned Mission No. 44.    Other than using absorbents and a vacuum truck to contain and remove gasoline from the roadway and the truck there was minimal additional remediation.  No additional environmental work is anticipated.    Rescue crews from Bartlett, Memphis and Shelby County responded to the scene. Residents of ""King's Daughters and Sons Home"" were evacuated as a precaution. The facility provides rehabilitation services for disabled senior citizens. There are 104 patients who live at the facility, 80 of which are wheelchair-bound.

Upon trailer docking, doors were opened and container was determined to be leaking. Upon inspection, it was determined that container lid had come loose at some point during transit causing a small amount of material to collect on side of container and trailer floor. Responders donned proper personal protective gear for the hazard involved and began the response by securing the lid on the tank and then absorbing the spilled material. Post removal of absorbents, vehicle was decontaminated.    No illness, injuries or exposures occurred.",An investigation into the cause of this incident was conducted. It was determined that human error in failing to follow established and procedure was the root cause. There was no evidence of any leakage at time of loading at orgin.

Mr. Douglas advised there were no reports of exposures, injuries, or inhalations. Mr. Douglas advised tank car UTLX 649610, a load of styrene monomer, had sloshed from the top of the railcar, with some product on the side of the tank, with a limited number of drops on the ground with no pooling noted.   Torn Robinson, Manager Hazardous Materials, responded and inspected the tank car.   This inspection revealed that the sloshing of material and dripping onto the ground was do to humidity condensing onto the tank car and not styrene. A small amount of styrene was leaking from the base of the 2-inch quarter turn ball valve, where the valve threads onto the liquid line nipple. This material was evaporatinG before t could run dowi the side of the tank car. Robinson conferred with Mr. Larry Huffine of Chevron Phillips and U.S,E.S.; a response contractor was dispatched to assist Robinson. The tank car was relieved of vapor pressure and the liquid valve was removed. The threads of the nipple were wrapped with Teflon tape and the valve was reinstalled. This secured the tank car from leaking.

Aircraft departed HSV enroute to PIK.Through SATCOM operations (approximately 45 minutes after departure) the crew reported a strong chemical odoron the aircraft. Aircraft was diverted to JFK. Airport Authority and Fire Department officials met the aircraft at the end of the runway and found nothing on the aircraft which the HAZMAT team could identify as hazardous to the crew.All tests came back negative. Aircraft was released back to crew. Atlas JFK station personnel notified ChemTrec.Minute Man Spill Response team suited in proper PPE and unloaded the pallet and did not find any visible spill orleak. As stated in Minute Man Spill report they did not pick up any readings on meters that were above normal. Theyfound a potential cause for the odor in a 20 gallon keg / drum that had a separation at the top where the bungattaches. This was not a shipping failure but a packaging imperfection. The product was Furful Alcohol Toxic 6 andthe product would be consistent with the odor described by the flight crew. The technicians also identified insectsattracted to the keg. The separation could be enough to allow the odor to escape but not have a visible spill. Also didnot get any reading on meters and the meters would not pick up a toxic odor. This is consistent with the fire department in that they also did not get readings even in the confined space of the aircraft. The keg was placed into a 30 gallon over pack drum, sealed, and labeled. The over pack would seal any vapor and prevent any potential spill.In the over pack drum the keg was safe for shipping. The keg was shipped back to HSV via truck transport.","As per Minute Man Spill response report ""this is not a shipping failure but a packaging imperfection"".",No,COMPOSITE,Plastic receptacle within a protective steel drum,6HA1,No,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7000,ATLAS AIR,US,

During a routine stop at Clean Harbor’s Braintree, MA Transfer, Storage and Disposal Facility, the material was transferred into an alternate vehicle for continuing transportation.  At the conclusion of the loading operation, the driver noticed that 2 containers had developed a small leak at the bottom chime of the containers.  It is estimated that approximately 3-5 gallons of material had released onto the floor of the van trailer with approximately ½ gallon of material leaking onto a concrete lined containment pad.  Facility personnel immediately enacted the facilities emergency response plan and using appropriate personal protective equipment entered the trailer and placed both containers into suitable salvage drums.  All free liquids were absorbed with a suitable absorbent material and this was placed in the salvage drum along with all material used to decontaminate the floor of the van trailer.  In addition, all material that was released to the containment pad was cleaned up and all debris placed in the salvage drums.  Once cleaned, the two salvage drums were sealed and we placed back onto the vehicle for continued transportation to the intended waste management facility.","At the time of loading, the containers were inspected and no evidence of leaking was observed.

During the inspection by BNSF contract responders, GATX 201247 (DOT 112J340W tank car) was found with product odor emanating from the threaded connection where the sample line valve's pipe nipple threads into the pressure plate. The responders applied putty around this threaded connection which eliminated the product odor. GATX 201247 was monitored and no further odor was detectable and the internal pressure within GATX 201247 was holding constant. Railyard operations were resumed at 0020 hrs. CDT, 5/28/08. In the morning of 5/28/08, the same contract responders successfully applied a Midland Sample Valve Capping assembly over the sample line valve to eliminate any product emissions.

The cause of thisderailment is still under investigation. GATX 72822 (DOT 111A100W5 tank car) derailed leaning into the overpass concrete support abutmentstructure. This collision impact resulted in the top safety handrails collapsing into and shearing off the vapor valve of GATX 72822. Product releasedfrom the open orifice vacated by the vapor valve and ceased once product equilibrium within the leaning tank car was reached and also after GATX72822 was uprighted. Lime was applied to neutralize ground spillage and impacted soils were excavated and sent to an approved landfill fordisposal. Later, site restoration was completed. The remaining product in GATX 72822 was transferred into tanker trucks by 0850 hrs. CDT, 5/18/08and returned to the shipper. GATX 72822 was cleaned and purged afterwards on 5/18/08. Air monitoring and soil samplings were maintainedthroughout the duration of this event.A precautionary evacuation of one mile radius was initiated which impacted approximately 3000 people. The evacuation ended at approximately1830 hrs. CDT, 5/18/08. Also, during railcar rerailing activities, a six mile span of U.S. Interstate 10 was closed and traffic rerouted.

GATX 50162 was carefully moved and isolated at the east end of the railyard. BNSF and contract responders discovered a small (1/4 inch) corrosion hole at the bottom of the sump area of GATX 50162. An internal rubber lining failure was suspected. Responders inserteda shaped boiler plug with caulking into the hole to stop the product release. A fiber glass resin was also applied over the outside plug area as an additional seal. The product leak was stopped by approximately 2000 hrs. CDT, 5/28/08. The ground spillage was contained within a dirt berm that was built and spillage was neutralized with lime. The neutralized ground spillage was remediated. The remaining product inside GATX 50162 was transferred into another suitable tank car without incident by 0530 hrs. CDT, 5/29/08. Soda ash was then poured into GATX 50162 to neutralize any product heel left inside this tank car.The Omaha F.D established an isolation area of 500 ft. around GATX 50162. An evacuation was initiated that impacted approximately 100 homes ina 1/2 mile area in south Omaha. This evacuation included Rosenblatt Stadium where a minor league baseball game was in progress which impacted approximately 2500 spectators and participants. Also, the Henry Doorly Zoo evacuated a group of students visiting the zoo. The U.S Highway 275 bridge over the Missouri River was also closed to vehicular traffic and the Omaha police discouraged traffic within a square mile of the spill site. The evacuation and road closures were lifted at approximately 0440 hrs.

Shipment was unloaded and notated as damaged at that time. Shipment was loaded on trailer 313-5238, and secured for delivery to customer. Delivery driver Paul Cranfill, broke his set of trailers and headed directly to Carboline. When he opened his door at Carboline, he immediately noticed that the rope used to secure the freight had broken and the pallet of pails were leaning onto another pallet.Driver Cranfill proceeded to search for leakage on the leaning pails, and noticed some seepage on the bottom of the pallet. With the help of Carboline Driver Cranfill started removing the pails to investigate further into where the leakage was coming from. Once all the pails were removed, it was determined that a total of 3 pails were leaking, and 45 were dented. They were immediately placed into a salvage drum. Upon futher investigation Driver Cranfill noticed that this pallet had to have been recouped previously, because there were rubber gloves tossed inside the pallet, and the pallet was wrapped in cardboard .Driver cranfill then cleaned the leaking product also placing it in the salvage drum, and returned the salvage drum and the 45 refused pails back to our dock in Fife.","PROPER BLOCKING AND BRACING OF FREIGHT USING DUNNAGE, AND ALWAYS ENSURE EXTRA DUNNAGE IS USED WHEN PAILS ARE STACKEDMORE THAN TWO HIGH.

The regulator was shipped in accordance with the liquid polychlorinated biphenyl special provision #81 as identified in 49 CFR 172.101, ""Table of Hazardous Materials and Special Provisions."" Special provision #81 states that a polychlorinated biphenyl item, itself, may be used as packaging if it meets the general packaging requirements of 49 CFR 173 subparts A and B. Prior to transportation, the regulator met the general packaging requirements and showed no signs of leakage.The regulator traveled from a substation in St. Cloud, MN to Minneapolis, MN. Approximately six blocks from arrival,the driver noticed that oil was leaking from the top of the regulator and dripping down the side. Due to the small amount of oil observed on the side of the unit, the driver decided it would be best to continue to the delivery location rather than stop in the middle of the city street. It is estimated that the release lasted three-five minutes.Upon arrival at the delivery point, the regulator was brought indoors and the PCB contaminated oil was immediately pumped out of the equipment. Xcel Energy employees walked the route back to determine the extent of the release.A trail of oil, mainly small spots every few feet, was observed back to the off-ramp the driver used to exit the Interstate (see attached map for route info). There was no free product in the roadway that needed containment, as the oil was only spotty and had already soaked into the asphalt, (continued on attached sheet)","Oil filled electrical equipment that will be transported from field locations will have the oil pumped into a cargo tank in the field and will be shipped empty whenever possible.

After review of the offeror's shipping papers, it was determined that these two commodities/packages were actually undeclared hazmat.    Upon this discovery, the two cylinders were removed from the freight container and immediately rejected for transport. Thus, the shipper was notified immediately that there shipment failed to meet our conditions of acceptance, and therefore, would need to be removed from our terminal facility or be made compliant for transportation. The result was the shipper elected to rescind the request for us to accept and transport their shipment, and the shipper picked up said shipment soon thereafter.    NOTE: On May 23rd, 2008, The shipper (Laparkan Trading) submitted an OHMS Incident Report on this same incident.

A pickup truck, owned by l-Iarwichport Heating and Cooling, collided into a tractor and tank trailer, owned by Cape Cod Oil, at the intersection of Great Western Road and Lothrop Avenue in Harwich, MA. The accident was caused by the driver of the Harwichport Heating and Cooling vehicle’s failure to stop at the stop sign at the Lothrop Avenue/Great Western Road intersection.   As a result of the accident, the tractor and tank trailer rolled over, rupturing the front compartment (3,400 gallon capacity) and rear compartment (3,500 gallon capacity) of the tank. A total volume of approximately 3,800 gallons of #2 fuel oil was released to the roadway and shoulder surfaces as a result of the incident.   Response actions have included: Pumping of remaining fuel oil inside of the tank, closure of the public road and bike path, the placement of sand berms, deployment of absorbent pads and booms, use of vac trucks to remove oil from the road surface and standing water in the wetland, removal of oil impacted vegetation from the wetland water line, placement of a harbor boom to prevent the migration of oil on the surface water table, excavation and off-site disposal of contaminated soils, groundwater recovery and treatment, and chemical oxidant injections to treat residual groundwater impact.","Where you are able to do so, suggest or describe changes (such as additional training, use of better packaging, or improved operating procedures) to help prevent recurrence.
