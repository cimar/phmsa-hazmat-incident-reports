THEY TOLD ME THAT THE STORAGE TANK AT THE ROUT 50 SATELLITE PLANT HAD STARTED LEAKING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK, AND THAT I WAS NEEDED THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  I LEFT THE OFFICE AS SOON AS I HUNG THE PHONE UP.  WHEN I GOT TO THE PLANT, THE HILLSBORO FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ALREADY THERE.  JAMES HALL, A DRIVER FOR L&L TRANSPORTATION WAS ALSO AT THE PLANT.  JAMES TOLD ME THAT HE WAS UNLOADING HIS TANK TRUCK INTO THE STORAGE TANK, AND WHEN HE WAS ALMOST FINISHED, HE HEARD A NOISE COME FROM THE TANK. HE LOOKED OVER AT THE STORAGE TANK AND FOUND THAT THE TANK HAD STARTED LEAKING AT THE BOTTOM.  AT THIS POINT JAMES SHUT HIS TRUCK DOWN AND CLOSED ALL THE EMERGENCY SHUT OFF VALVES AT THE PLANT.  I TOOK A GOOD LOOK AT THE LEAK AND DETERMINED THAT IT COULD NOT BE REPAIRED WITHOUT HELP.  AT THIS POINT I CALLED ED MILLER AT OUR FLORANCE OFFICE, WHO IS OVER OUR SAFETY DEPARTMENT.  I TOLD HIM WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND HE TOLD ME HE WOULD GET SOME HELP TO US.  WITHIN A FEW MINUTES, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM RON CRIST, TELLING ME THAT HE WAS ON HIS WAY.  I ALSO RECEIVED A CALL FROM TOM WRIGHT WHO ASKED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND WHAT HE COULD DO TO HELP.  I THEN RECEIVED A CALL FROM JEFF VANDEMARK WITH INDUSTRIAL PROPANE SERVICE.  HE ASKED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS, AND TOLD ME HE WAS SENDING TWO PEOPLE TO HELP AND IT WOULD TAKE FIVE OR SIX HOURS FOR THEM TO GET THERE.  BY THIS TIME, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DETERMINED THE LEAK WAS BAD ENOUGH THAT THEY SHOULD SHUT DOWN STATE ROUTE 50.  WE DETERMINED THAT THE 76% OF LIQUID PROPANE IN THE STORAGE TANK HAD TO BE REMOVED.  BEFORE RON CRIST ARRIVED, HE CALLED AGAIN TO LET US KNOW THAT IF WE WRAPPED WET TOWELS AROUND THE INTERNAL VALVE, THIS MIGHT SLOW OR EVEN STOP THE LEAK.  THE HIGHLAND COUNTY HAZMAT TEAM TOOK ON THE JOB OF WRAPPING THE WET RAGS AROUND THE VALVE AND THIS DID HELP SLOW THE LEAK.  L&L TRANSPORTATION DID NOT WANT THEIR TRANSPORT TRUCK CLOSE TO THE STORAGE TANK, WHERE IT NEEDED TO BE IN ORDER TO PUMP THE GAS BACK OUT.  SO I CALLED ONE OF OUR BOBTAILS TO THE SITE SO WE COULD USE IT TO TAKE GAS FROM THE STORAGE TANK AND PUT BACK INTO THE TRANSPORT.  AFTER STARTING THIS PROCESS, RON CRIST MADE A FEW CALLS AND BEFORE LONG, WE HAD SEVERAL BOBTAILS FROM OUR BRANCH AND OTHER BRANCHES TO HELP EVACUATE THE 30,000 GALLON STORAGE TANK.  BEFORE THE TANK WAS EMPTY, JERRY DAVIS AND JEREMY VIK FROM IPS ARRIVED AT THE PLANT.  SOON AFTER THE STORAGE TANK WAS EMPTY OF LIQUID., JERRY STARTED THE PROCESS OF BURNING THE VAPOR PRESSURE FROM THE STORAGE TANK.  AROUND 9:30 PM THE VAPOR PRESSURE WAS DOWN TO NOTHING AND EVERYONE LEFT THE PLANT.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OPENED STATE ROUT 50 AROUND 7:30 PM.  THE NEXT MORNING, IPS ARRIVED AT THE PLANT AND TOOK THE PIPING APART AND REMOVED THE INTERNAL VALVE FROM THE STORAGE TANK.  THEY FOUND A CRACK IN THE BODY OF THE VALVE, WHICH CAUSED THE LEAK.  THEY REPLACED THE VALVE, AND ADDED A PIECE OF FLEX HOSE IN THE PIP",,No,TANK,Storage tank,TANK STG,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,25,,US,

THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER CONTAINED 80 DRUMS OF EPICHLOROHYDRIN.  THE CONTAINER IS RED, APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET IN LENGTH AND 12 FEET IN HEIGHT, IS OWNED BY ""K"" LINE, AND IS IDENTIFIED BY THE FOLLOWING NUMBER: KLTU1138768.  UPON RECEIPT, THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER WAS OPENED AND A LEAK OF EPICHLOROHYDRIN WAS DISCOVERED.  SET ENVIRONMENTAL, INC. (""SET"") AN ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPANY, WAS RETAINED BY CAREFREE TO INITIATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE EFFORTS AT THE CHICAGOLAND FACILITY.  WEARING LEVEL B PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, SET REMOVED ALL OF THE 80 DRUMS FROM THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER.  EACH OF THE DRUMS WERE INSPECTED FOR DAMAGE AND DENTS.  TWENTY-FOUR DRUMS WERE NOT DAMAGED OR DENTED.  FIFTY-FIVE OF THE DRUMS WERE DENTED AND/OR DAMAGED.  THESE DENTED/DAMAGED DRUMS WERE PLACED IN OVERPACK CONTAINERS.  SET IDENTIFIED ONE DRUM THAT HAD A PINHOLE LEAK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DRUM.  SET ESTIMATED THAT 18 GALLONS OF EPICHLOROHYDRIN WERE RELEASED FROM THE LEAKING DRUM.  MUCH OF THE EPICHLOROHYDRIN LEAKED INTO THE WOODEN FLOOR BOARDS SERVING AS THE FLOOR OF THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER.  APPROXIMATELY ONE CUP OF EPICHLOROHYDRIN LEAKED OUTSIDE OF THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER ONTO THE CHASSIS SUPPORTING THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER. APPROXIMATELY ONE CUP OF EPICHLOROHYDRIN LEAKED OUTSIDE OF THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER ONTO A PAVED SURFACE.  SET ENVIRONMENTAL IS IN THE PROCESS OF DECONTAMINATING THE CHASSIS AND REMOVING THE WOODEN FLOOR OF THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER FOR APPROPRIATE HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE LEAKING DRUM, CAREFREE COMPLETED AN INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE WHEN THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER SUFFERED THE DAMAGE THAT LED TO THE LEAKING DRUM.  THROUGH ITS INVESTIGATION, CAREFREE BELIEVES THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER WAS DROPPED AND DAMAGED WHEN IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE SHIP IN TACOMA, WASHINGTON.  CAREFREE'S INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER, OWNED BY ""K"" LINE, WAS REPORTED TO BE IN A DAMAGED CONDITION ON OR ABOUT NOVEMBER 6, 2004.  THIS INFORMATION WAS DOCUMENTED IN A ""K"" LINE UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE REPORT (UOR).  THIS UOR CONFIRMS THAT THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER AND ITS CONTENTS SUSTAINED SERIOUS DAMAGE BEFORE THE INTERMODAL CONTAINER CAME INTO THE POSSESSION OF CAREFREE FOR DELIVERY TO CHICAGOLAND. ALTHOUGH CAREFREE HAS TAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO QUICKLY REMEDIATE THE CONTAMINATION CAUSED BY THE LEAKING DRUM OF EPICHLOROHYDRIN, OUR INVESTIGATION HAS SHOWN THAT IT WAS NOT CAREFREE THAT CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE CONTAINER OR THE DRUM OF EPICHLOROHYDRIN.
