AFTER LOADING THE TRAILER THE DRIVER DEPARTED THE LOADING POINT AND DROVE ANOTHER 1.8 MILES TO THE POINT WHEN THE KING PIN OF THE TRAILER BECAME DISENGAGED FROM THE FIFTH WHEEL OF THE TRACTOR.  AFTER THE KING PIN BECAME DISENGAGED FROM THE FIFTH WHEEL THE TRAILER SLID OFF THE BACK OF THE TRACTOR AND THE DOLLIES OF THE TRAILER IMPACTED THE PAVEMENT, COLLAPSED AND THE TRAILER NOSE THEN RESTED ON THE PAVEMENT.  WHEN THE DOLLIES COLLAPSED ONE OF THE DOLLY SUPPORT BRACES PENETRATED #2 COMPARTMENT SPILLING THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THAT COMPARTMENT.  THE OTHER COMPARTMENTS RETAINED THE PRODUCT WHICH WAS TRANSFERRED INTO ANOTHER 306AL CARGO TANK.  THE SPILLED PRODUCT RAN TO THE CURB SIDE OF THE ROAD AND DIRECTLY INTO A STORM DRAIN WHICH LED DIRECTLY TO THE ALLEGHENY RIVER. IMMEDIATE ACTION WAS TAKEN BY THE LOCAL FIRE AND POLICE TO SECURE THE AREA.  UNITED REFINING COMPANY PROVIDED FOAM TO PLACE ON THE SPILLED PRODUCT.  A BOOM WAS PLACED IN THE RIVER BELOW THE STORM DRAIN AND A CLEAN UP CONTRACTOR VACUUMED THE PRODUCT FROM THE WATER.  AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE A ONE BLOCK AREA SURROUNDING THE SCENE WAS EVACUATED FROM ABOUT 0830 UNTIL 1330 THAT DAY.  AT ABOUT 1500 THAT DAY LOCAL DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT PERSONNEL WERE SATISFIED THAT THE AREA WAS FREE OF CONTAMINATION AND REQUESTED THAT THE BOOM BE PULLED.  SINCE THE SPILLED PRODUCT WAS CONFINED TO THE BLACKTOP AREA AND STORM SEWER NO EXCAVATION OF EARTH WAS REQUIRED.  ON 10-14-92 THE US DOT INVESTIGATORS, PA PUC AND LOCAL POLICE CONDUCTED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE WHICH AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT IS CONTINUING.  AT THE PRESENT TIME ALL COUPLING PROCEDURES ARE BEING REVIEWED AND THE MANUFACTURER IS BEING CONSULTED.  AFTER COMPLETION OF THIS RE-EVALUATION ALL EMPLOYEES WILL BE RETRAINED IN COUPLING PROCEDURES.

THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY STOPPED HIS VEHICLE, VISUALLY CONFIRMED THAT MATERIAL WAS LEAKING FROM THE REAR DOOR AND NOTIFIED HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR AS TO HIS LOCATION AND SITUATIO. THE DISPATCHER THEN INITIATED NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES TO INFORM STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES OF THE RELEASE. AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE CREW WAS ALSO DISPATCHED FORM CLEAN HARBORS OF CHICAGO, INC. SERVICE CENTER AT THIS TIME. AFTER PLACING THE CALL TO DISPATCH, THE DRIVER CONSTRUCTED A DIKE WITH EQUIPMENT CARRIED IN THE TRAILERS ""SPILL KIT"". THIS CONTAINED THE SPILLED MATERIAL ON THE PAVED ROADWAY AND PREVENTED ANY SOIL CONTAMINATION FROM OCCURRING. WHILE PERFORMING THIS OPERATION, THE ILLINOIS STATE POLICE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE ALONG WITH LOCAL FIRE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS RESPONSE GROUPS. THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TOOK CONTROL OF THE AREA AN WERE PROVIDED WITH COPIES OF ALL SHIPPING DOCUMENTS. AT THIS POINT, THE LOCAL AGENCIES AT THE SCENE PROCEEDED TO ENTER THE VEHICLE TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.

THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CREW DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE BY CLEAN HARBORS CONTAINERIZED ALL THE DEBRIS RESULTING FROM THE RELEASE (APPROXIMATELY 80 GALLONS OF STYRENE) AND CLEANED THE AREA TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE ILLINOIS EPA REPRESENTATIVE ON SITE. ALL DEBRIS RESULTING FROM THE RELEASE WAS THEN SHIPPED TO A FULLY LICENSED WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITY FOR DISPOSAL.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE CLEAN-UP AND DECONTAMINATION OF THE TRAILER, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE BOTTOM VALVE CAP ON THE PORTABLE TANK IN QUESTION WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY TIGHTENED. BOTH THE DRIVER AND THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SHIPPER HAVE STATED THAT THE VALVE WAS CHECKED BY HAND TO INSURE THAT THE CAP WAS IN PLACE PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. IT IS EVIDENT, HOWEVER, THAT IN ORDER TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF THIS SITUATION, ALL TANK VALVES MUST BE TIGHTENED WITH A PIPE WRENCH PRIOR TO DEPARTURE TO INSURE THAT ALL VALVES ARE SUFFICIENTLY CLOSED.

WE FOUND A YELLOW C CONTAINER WITH 5 GREEN RUBBERMAID STORAGE CONTAINERS, SEALED WITH CLEAR PACKAGING TAPE. THESE CONTAINERS WERE LOADED ON TOP APPROX. 10 PLASTIC BAGS OF EXPRESS ENVELOPES. THE CLEAR LIQUID WAS TESTED, NO PH READING, SLIGHT ODOR OF ALCOHOL. THE CONTAINERS WERE UNLOADED, ONE OF THE CONTAINERS PACKAGED AS FOLLOWS, SMALL NASCO WHIRL-PAKS INSIDE AN ADDITIONAL NASCO WHIRL-PAK EACH WHIRL-PAK SEALED WITH PINCH TYPE CLOSURES. THESE WERE PACKED IN A LARGE CLEAR PACKAGING TAPE. THE CAUSE OF THE LEAKAGE WAS FROM THE PINCH TYPE CLOSURES NOT MAKING AN ADEQUATE SEAL TO CONTAIN THE FLUID INSIDE. THERE WAS AN INTERNATIONAL BILL OF LANDING AND A SHIPMENT INVOICE ATTACHED TO ONE OF THE CONTAINERS WHICH STATED THE CONTENTS WERE ""SEDIMENT SAMPLES"". THE INVOICE STATED ""SEDIMENT SAMPLES IN ETHANOL, THE ETHANOL HAD BEEN MARKED THROUGH AND WATER PRINTED UNDER THE MARKED THROUGH ETHANOL, THERE WAS A SIGNATURE AT THE CORRECTION. DUE TO THE CONFLICT OF THE LIQUID THE SEDIMENT SAMPLES WERE PACKAGED IN, THE ODOR AND THE EMPLOYEE'S IN CONTACT, THE SHIPMENT WAS HELD AND A MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET WAS REQUESTED FROM THE SHIPPER. ALL OF THE EXPRESS MAIL WAS REPACKAGED INTO NEW PLASTIC BAGS, THE CONTAINERS OF SEDIMENT SAMPLES WERE PLACED INTO PLASTIC BAGS AND TAKEN TO THE HAZ MAT SORT. THE SHIPPER SENT A LETTER STATING THE SHIPMENT WAS MADE UP OF APPROX. 200 LAKE SEDIMENT SAMPLES (MUD AND BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES). THESE SAMPLES WERE PRESERVED IN 70% ETHANOL. UPON DETERMINING THAT THEY DECIDED TO SHIP THE SAMPLES WITHOUT PRESERVATIVE AND REPRESERVE IMMEDIATELY UPON ARRIVAL AT THEIR DESTINATION. THE SHIPPER ALSO STATED THAT THE ETHANOL WAS REMOVED BY DECANTING THE SAMPLES AND TRANSFERRING THE SEDIMENT TO WHIRLPACK  BAGS BY RINSING THE ORIGINAL SEDIMENT OUT OF THE CONTAINERS WITH WATER, THUS DILUTING ANY REMAINING ETHANOL TO ONLY TRACE AMOUNTS. DUE TO THE ODOR BEING STRONGER THAN A TRACE, A FIELD TEST FOR FLAMMABILITY WAS DONE. A RANDOM SAMPLE WAS TAKEN FROM EACH OF THE 5 CONTAINERS, A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE LIQUID TESTED AND EACH OF THE SAMPLES BURNED. THE ETHANOL HAD NOT BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SAMPLES. THE SHIPPER WAS ADVISED OF THESE FINDINGS AND A SECOND MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET WAS REQUESTED. A MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET FOR ETHANOL WAS RECEIVED. THERE WERE APPROX. 280 SEDIMENT SAMPLES FROM THE 5 CONTAINERS ALL WITH ETHANOL. TOTAL AMOUNT OF ETHANOL ESTIMATED TO BE 33.6 LITERS.

JERRY CHECKED THE VALVE, WHICH APPEARED TO BE CRACKED, THEN CALLED IN TO REPORT THE LEAKAGE TO DISPATCH.      SHOP FOREMAN RONNIE DUNCAN CALLED ME AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION. I DIRECTED HIM TO IMMEDIATELY TAKE A TRACTOR AND EMPTY CARGO TANK TO THE SCENE AND TRANSFER THE MATERIAL.     I THEN RESPONDED TO THE SCENE WITH SAFETY AND SPILL CONTAINMENT EQUIPMENT.      A VACUUM TRAILER WAS ALSO DISPATCHED TO REMOVE THE SPILLED MATERIAL FROM THE GROUND.      EMPLOYEES LEAVING WORK FROM A NEARBY CHEMICAL PLANT ASSISTED IN CONTAINING THE SPILL RUNOFF BY DIKING THE DRAIN DITCH WITH SODA ASH. CLEAN-UP TRANSPORT'S CREW TRANSFERRED THE LOAD TO ANOTHER TANKER. IMMEDIATELY AFTER TRANSFERRING THE LOAD, VACUUMING OF THE SPILLED MATERIAL BEGAN WITH THE VACUUM TANK.  ALL VISIBLE LIQUID WAS VACUUMED FROM THE DITCH AND DIKED AREA.      A PH TEST REVEALED THAT THE SPILLED MATERIAL HAD A PH OF 12.  A SOLUTION OF VINEGAR AND WATER WAS THEN USED TO NEUTRALIZE THE SPILL AREA RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF THE PH TO 10. APPROXIMATELY 35 GALLONS OF VINEGAR WAS USED.      WE QUIT THE CLEAN-UP OPERATION AT 12:30 AM AND RESUMED THE EFFORT AT 8:00 AM THE FOLLOWING MORNING.      THE PH WAS CHECKED AGAIN BEFORE STARTING AND FOUND TO BET 10. 35 GALLONS MORE VINEGAR WAS THEN USED TO NEUTRALIZE THE SPILL AREA IN AN EFFORT TO LOWER THE PH FURTHER. THE PH WAS BROUGHT DOWN TO 9 AND EXCAVATION OF THE MATERIAL BEGAN.    THE LEAKING TRAILER HAD TO BE MOVED APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET IN ORDER FOR THE MATERIAL TO BE PUMPED INTO THE EMPTY TANK. THIS ENLARGED THE SPILL AREA CAUSING MUCH MORE SOIL TO BECOME CONTAMINATED AND REQUIRING REMOVAL.  ALL VISIBLE SOIL WAS REMOVED WITH AN EXCAVATOR AND LOADED ONTO END DUMP EQUIPMENT OPERATED BY CLEAN-UP. AFTER EXCAVATING THE CONTAMINATED SOIL, ED THOMPSON, AN INSPECTOR WITH THE ARKANSAS POLLUTION CONTROL AND ECOLOGY DEPARTMENT, CHECKED AND APPROVED THE SITE WAS READY FOR BACKFILL.  THE SITE WAS FILLED, SEEDED AND FERTILIZED.         A FULL SCAN TCLP, RCI AND PAINT FILTER ANALYSIS WERE PERFORMED ON THE EXCAVATED MATERIAL WHICH VERIFIED THAT THE MATERIAL WAS NON-HAZARDOUS.     THE MATERIAL WAS THEN ACCEPTED BY AND TRANSPORTED TO WASTE MANAGEMENT'S MAGNOLIA LANDFILL IN MONROE, LOUISIANA.     CARGO TANK #196 WAS CHECKED. THE EMERGENCY VALVE WAS ALLOWING MATERIAL AROUND ITS SEAT DUE TO A BROKEN SEALING RING. THE MATERIAL WAS THEN LEAKING FROM THE OUTERMOST VALVE DUE TO THE CORROSIVE ACTION OF THE ""GREEN LIQUOR"" WHICH WAS BEING TRANSPORTED.     THE EMERGENCY VALVE WAS REPAIRED AND THE OUTER VALVE REPLACED. AFTER REPAIR THE TANK WAS TESTED AND PLACED BACK IN SERVICE.OTHER VALVES OF THE SAME TYPE WERE CHECKED.
