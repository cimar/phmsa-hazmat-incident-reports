The Trailer had three compartments 2500/1900/3500 gallons.  Upon completion of the load product was observed dripping from the shell onto the lading system.  The IMTT employee immediately placed a drip bucket beneath the drip and called the safety department.  The IMTT employee made sure the containment was isolated and placed absorbent pads around the wet product on the cement.  IMTT vacuum trucks were used to remove the collected product from the drip pan while the IMTT employee used the unloading pump to empty the trailer.  The truck was then rejected.  Note the truck was inspected and had valid VINK.,Carriers must ensure there equipment is prepared to carry hazardous materials not just annually but before each shipment.  IMTT followed an established inspection and loading procedure and it appears that toll completed the requlatory required inspections however the incident still occurred.  IMTT has reported several incidents since implementation of the new reporting requirements that carriers have problems that go undetected between inspection cycles.  The incidents can be characterized as minor solely because they occurr at a facility that is prepared to handle such incidents.

The driver looked under the trailer and saw that the bottom of the trailer was wet.  The driver then decided he would continue driving west a few miles to the Flying J travel plaza where he then stopped his truck, opened the trailer doors and saw a small amount of liquid on the floor beneath the pallet of paint thinner. The driver had gone into the travel plaza where he bought some peat moss absorbent, applied the absorbent to the floor of the trailer where he could see liquid, shut the door and then called the spill in.    Upon arrival to the site, the spill response company put on level C PPE and proceeded inside the trailer. There was a double stack of paint thinner on a pallet at the rear of the trailer and after looking over all of the containers on the pallet, personnel were able to find one leaking container of paint thinner that was located on the top of the double stack of paint thinner.    The response team over-packed the 5-gallon leaking metal bucket into a 14-gallon poly container along with the peat moss absorbent that the driver had placed on the floor of the trailer. It was estimated that about 2-3 gallons had leaked from the container onto the floor of the trailer. Response personnel could see that on the bottom and side of the container, there was a hairline crack in the container that may have been caused from stress or heat.    Once all of the 5-gallon pails where removed from the pallet and inspected for any leaking containers, response personnel used rags to wipe the liquid from the pallet and applied floor dry to the floor of the trailer to finish absorbing and cleaning any residual liquid left on the floor of the trailer. Personnel also used rags to wipe the liquid from underneath the trailer.    The response team then placed the clean pallet on the floor of the trailer, restacked the 5-gallon buckets on the pallet, used rope to strap and secure the buckets for transport down the road. All clean up debris and PPE was placed in the 14-gallon poly and taken for proper disposal.  The elapsed time for the emergency response and site cleanup was approximately 10 hours.",A recommendation will be made to the shipper to check the status of current drum stock.

As the operator entered the rear of the trailer, the combined weight of the forklift and tote caused the trailer to squat.  As the forklift entered the trailer, one of the tote supports (leg) caught the lip of the trailer floor above the tailgate.  The tote leg folded under, causing a split in the tank body at the point where the foot is welded.  The split was approx. 1/2"" by 4"".    The tote was immediately backed off of the trailer onto the dock by the operator.  Another operator in the area assisted in tipping the tote on its side to stop the release.  The released material was absorbed and containerized for subsequent disposal.  The remaining liquid was transferred to another tote.  72 pounds of material was released.",Enhanced training was provided to the forklift operator to better judge the squatting of trailers upon entry with totes for the purpose of providing additional lift to the load.

The dock worker had his blades raised too high and one plastic drum was punctured. A small amount of hazmat ( o.1 kg) leaked out of the drum . The drum was aready on the truck. The warehouse was evacuated at this point. The fire department and a HAZMAT cleanup company were called. The MSDS could not be obtained from the 24 hour emergency number on the   DGR/Hazmat declaration ( TEL# 011 39 0321/642211 FAX# 011 39 0321 642219) this did extend the time of evacuation. Finally the fire department used an generic MSDS which stated the toxic hazard packing group was only an ""  irritant "" The Fire Department ended the evacuation at this point. Also the hazmat clean up company arrived and the drum was placed in a larger recovery drum and the 0.1kg on the truck was cleaned up. This shipment was picked up a few hours latter.",The contractor of the forklift driver ( GlobeGround) gave written corrective action. The all DGR/HAZMAT shipments will be double skidded and shrinkwrapped in the future. GroundGlobe will also give further forklift training so that the forklift blades do not stick out and damage hazmat/DGR.    In a meeting between Lufthansa Cargo and GroundGlobe the incident and corrective action was dicussed at great lenghts.

Newsom Trucking, DOT # 1160386, wearing protective equipment appropriate for sodium hypochlorite unload, followed specific detailed instructions from consignee employees like past instruction at this unload:   Attach hose with elbow affixed to fitting in hinged metal closure of consignee concrete container;   Commence unloading.  After unloading approximately 30 minutes, a loud boom from inside the container was followed by equipment/debris on top of container becoming airborne, including the metal closure and the hose/elbow which were thrown some distance.  Driver retreated until debris settled, about a minute, returned and shut emergency switch which stopped the unload process.  Approximately 100 gallons of sodium hypochlorite 15% by weight (about 150#) had spilled from the broken hose elbow.   As driver turned off the emergency switch on the trailer, he was overcome by vapors from the decomposition inside the container which had caused the strong pressure release.  He was removed from the scene and transported to a hospital where he was treated for respiratory distress and released within 3-4 hours.","Newsom Trucking (DOT #1160386) /Vertex Chemical (DOT #285290) changed procedures:  consignees have been notified that in future unload will not occur into containers which are not labeled with chemical contents identified, regardless of specific direction by consignee.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,VERTEX CHEMICAL CORPORATION,US,

The Scale House attendant became concerned when she observed damage to the trailer consistent with a load shift.  After reviewing the shipping papers, she found that the cargo included Sodium Perborate Monohydrate, a 5.1 oxidizer.  The attendant reportedly contacted the Sauk Village Fire Dept.  The Sauk Village Fire Dept. opened the back of the trailer and observed a white powder on the floor of the trailer that had leaked from a bag labeled Sodium Perborate Monohydrate.  The attendant expressed concern that she had been exposed to the oxidizer.  At 12:13 CST, the Highway Patrol closed U.S. 30 in both directions.  The attendant was reportedly transported to a medical facility and was later seen returning to the site and driving away in a passenger vehicle.      Werner Enterprises contacted ACT at approximately 12:30 CST and requested dispatch of an Emergency Response Team.  At approximately 12:50 CST SUNPRO dispatched a crew to the scene.  The crew arrived onsite at 13:15 CST.  SUNPRO inspected the site and observed no release of materials to the environment.  SUNPRO inspected the load and found a tear in one (1) bag of Sodium Perborate Monohydrate.  The material was transferred into a 5-gallon poly pail (UN1H2/Y1.6/30) which was properly labeled and replaced on the trailer.  Three (3) pallets of product were offloaded onto a SUNPRO vehicle so that the Werner tractor-trailer would meet weight limits.  The SUNPRO vehicle and the Werner tractor-trailer proceeded to the SUNPRO Chicago Regional Office located in Schererville, IN where the load was rearranged to properly distribute the weight across the axles.  During the reloading process, a second leaking bag of Sodium Perborate Monohydrate and several leaking bags on a non-hazardous powder were found.  The damaged bags were transferred in separate 5-gallon pails (UN1H2/Y1.6/30) along with floor sweepings of the same.  The pails were properly labeled and replaced onto the trailer.  Once all packages were secured and all spilled materials were swept up, the tractor-trailer was released to deliver its load to the consignee.","The shipper needs to review protocol for proper loading of this type of packaging, including inspection of materials following loading to ensure that no rips or tears have occurred.",Yes,BAG PAPER,Paper bag (cont1 for solid materials),BAG PPR,No,,,,,,,280,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,4000,"American Compliance Technologies, Inc.",US,

The driver for Split, Stanley Krysciak, CDL K622-7805-5208, rear ended a stopped semi that was in the middle lane directly in front of him.  There were no skid marks or physical evidence that Krysciak applied his brakes prior to the collision.  Krysciak was killed from the impact.  Krysciak's view may have been obstructed by the oasis overpass.  It took the local authorities almost 10 hours to remove the driver.  Krysciak had had a good driving record.  We are awaiting a copy of the police report and police vehicular inspection of the truck.  The above account is based on conversations with others and based on newspaper reports.  We believe that the tractor's brakes were in good mechanical condition and that the condition of the brakes did not play a role in the collision.  If the police vehicular inspection report indicates otherwise, we will notify you.      The trailer for Split Transfer included a total of 18 barrels of ink (appx. 500 pounds each) in front of 7 totes (2500 pounds each).  The impact from the collision and totes flattened the 18 barrels, causing the release of ink from the barrels.  SET Environmental, a first responder, arrived at approximately 3:30 a.m. The release of ink was cleaned up by SET under the supervision of the engineering firm, Burns & McDonnell.  A complete report is in the process of being prepared in regard to the clean up, remediation and test results.","(1) Split has reinforced the importance of safety with all of its drivers; and,  (2) Equipment has been checked.",Yes,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,264575,Split Transfer Corp.,US,

THE FORCE OF THE PRESSURE RELEASE RESULTED IN THE CONTAINER BEING LAUNCHED THROUGH THE PROOF OF THE TRANSPORT TRAILER HOLDING THE DRUM ONTO A GRASSY AREA ADJACENT TO THE FACILITY'S CONTAINMENT AREA.  PLEASE NOTE THAT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT THE TRANSPORT TRAILER WAS STAGED AT A FULLY CONTAINED OFF-LOADING AREA WITHIN CLEAN HARBORS FLORIDA, LLC'S TRANSFER STORAGE AND DISPOSAL FACILITY LOCATED AT 170 BARTOW MUNICIPAL AIRPORT, BARTOW, FL.  FACILITY EMPLOYEES, UPON HEARING THE NOISE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUPTURE OF THE CONTAINER, IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE FACILITY'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATOR (ERC).  THE SURROUNDING AREA WAS SECURED PENDING THE ARRIVAL OF APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL.  UPON ARRIVAL OF THE ERC THE TRAILER INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS IDENTIFIED AND THE SHIPPING MANIFESTS WERE RETRIEVED AND REVIEWED.  WHILE THE SHIPPING DOCUMENTS WERE BEING REVIEWED, FACILITY PERSONNEL INSPECTED THE CONTAINER THAT WAS LAUNCHED FROM THE TRANSPORT TRAILER AND IDENTIFIED IT AS A CONTAINER USED TO SHIP A LIQUID MONOMER MATERIAL FROM VISTAKON JOHNSON & JOHNSON.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CONTAINER INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT WAS THE ONLY CONTAINER OF THAT MATERIAL IN THIS PARTICULAR SHIPMENT.  IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE DRUM WAS COMPLETELY EMPTY AND THE BOTTOM SECTION OF THE DRUM WAS MISSING.  THE TRANSPORT TRAILER, WHICH PREVIOUSLY CONTAINED THE DRUM, WAS OPENED AND INSPECTED BY THE FACILITY'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM UTILIZING APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT AND APPROVED HEALTH AND SAFETY PROCEDURES.  AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTION, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE LIQUID MONOMER MATERIAL REACTED WITHIN THE CONTAINER AND POLYMERIZED INTO A MONOLITHIC SOLID.  THE POLYMERIZATION CAUSED THE DRUM TO OVERPRESSURIZE AND THE BOTTOM SEAM OF THE DRUM TO RUPTURE THEREBY RELEASING PRESSURE AND LAUNCHING THE CONTAINER.  THE SOLID MATERIAL WAS SCATTERED ABOUT THE TRAILER AS WELL AS ON THE CONCRETE CONTAINMENT AREA ADJACENT TO THE TRAILER.  ALL OF THE SPILLED MATERIAL WAS COLLECTED AND PLACED INTO APPROPRIATE CONTAINERS FOR DISPOSAL AT A FULLY LICENSED WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITY.","IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT, THE APPROVAL TO SHIP THE WASTE STREAM INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT WAS SUSPENDED PENDING AN INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY THE FACILITY'S MANAGEMENT TEAM, HEALTH & SAFETY REPRESENTATIVES AND THE SHIPPER OF THE MATERIAL.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE MATERIAL IN QUESTION IS ROUTINELY PACKAGED IN LINED CONTAINERS AND A HEADSPACE OF APPROXIMATELY 1/4 THE VOLUME OF THE CONTAINER IS MAINTAINED TO ALLOW EXPANSION OF THE MATERIAL DURING SHIPPING AND STORAGE.  IT WAS ALSO LEARNED THAT UNLINED STEEL CONTAINERS ARE NORMALLY NOT UTILIZED TO PACKAGE THIS MATERIAL AS RUST THAT CAN FORM ON THE SIDEWALLS OF A STEEL CONTAINER CAN CONTAMINATE THE MATERIAL AND CAUSE A POLYMERIZATION REACTION TO OCCUR.  OUR INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE USE OF AN UNLINED STEEL CONTAINER.  HIGH AMBIENT AIR TEMPERATURES EXPERIENCED ON THE STATE OF FLORIDA CAUSED CONDENSATION TO BUILD UP IN THE HEADSPACE OF THE CONTAINER; THEREFORE, CONTRIBUTING TO THE FORMATION OF SURFACE RUST ON THE SIDEWALL OF THE STEEL DRUM.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THESE IMPURITIES INITIATED THE POLYMERIZATION REACTION.  IN ORDER TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE OF THIS INCIDENT, THE SHIPPER OF THIS MATERIAL WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECERTIFY THE APPROVAL PROFILE FOR THIS WASTE STREAM AND WILL BE REQUIRED TO CERTIFY THAT THE PROPER UN RATED SHIPPING CONTAINER IS USED THAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE MATERIAL BEING SHIPPED.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,11030,CLEAN HARBORS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES,US,

Westlake Styrene, LP, of Sulphur, Louisiana, had shipped this car containing Styrene Monomer and an inhibitor to Queen City Terminals (“QCT”) reportedly owned by Kinder-Morgan in Cincinnati, Ohio. According to available records, at 15:15 on 01/21/05, one minute after the car arrived in Sharonville and before the TORY had actually received the car, QCT faxed instructions to the TORY on where to spot the car. Again, according to available records, the car arrived on the TORY’s line, Cincinnati Main No. 2, at 22:30 that night. Subsequently, QCT sent another fax on. 0 1/24/05 again giving instructions on where to place car PLCX 224841 on QCT’s property. The car information was transferred onto the TORY electronic information system, which uses a repetitive waybill code (“RWC”) to complete waybill forms with pre-loaded information. Due to an inadvertent clerical error, the RWC in this instance contained incorrect information, including the destination and client fields. On 01/24/05, an TORY employee caught the error i.n the RWC and corrected the RWC Code identifying the client on the billing screen and changed it to QCT. However, this change did not modify the destination or the Online Patron Report, which was generated from the destination field on a daily basis for clients and TORY personnel. According to applicable records, at 22:34 on 01/28/05, the TORY moved the car into McCullough Yard, and on 03/12/05, the IORY moved the car from McCollough Yard into Undercliff(Linwood) Yard at 1330 hours. The TORY received no further requests or inquiries about the subject car from QCT or Westlake. At approximately 18:30 on 08/28/05, the car began venting styrene as a result of the apparent exhaustion of the inhibitor and the consequential polymerization of the styrene. The NS received the emergency dispatch and responded. The TORY was notified but did not receive any 911 or emergency calls. The incident was called in to the National Response Center. The TORY obtained the bill of lading, contacted Chemtrek and Westlake for recommending an appropriate emergency response. Emergency personnel sprayed water on the tanker car to cool the polymerization process and to reduce the possibility of explosion. The investigation into this incident is not yet completed and if additional information becomes available, it will be included in a follow-up report.","After learning of the incident, the TORY immediately canvassed its car inventory to confirm that it had affirmative control of the location of all shipments containing hazardous materials. Since the incident, the TORY has created a database that automatically generates a “Hazardous Materials 48-hour Report” on cars containing hazardous materials, as well as time-sensitive tabs to identify shipments that require special attention monitoring based on the commodity involved. This report is generated seven days a week at approximately 04:00. The TORY is also adding two Automatic Equipment Identifiers (“AEI”) which are planned to be placed north and south of Springfield, Ohio, by 10/10/05 to assist in automatically monitoring inventory. In addition, the TORY is reiterating in employee training the importance of recording and transmitting correct information, specifically instructing to check all fields in the electronic information system when changes or corrections are made, and emphasizing the importance of vigilance and awareness in identifying, moving and accurately repositing hazardous materials and the location thereof.",Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,0,INDIANA & OHIO RAILWAY,US,

A pallet from another shipment shifted  during transportation and crushed the carton containing the organic peroxide. Because there was a wall of freight between the damaged carton and the tail of the trailer, the damaged carton was not discovered until the rest of the freight was unloaded.  The employee unloading this trailer stated that she could smell a strong odor but figured it emitted from the considerable amount of Ashland chemicals on the trailer. When the wall of freight was reduced, the smell increased and the damage was discovered. The employee went out side for fresh air and the terminal manager took her to the hospital. She was evaluated and checked out ok. The other employee used gloves to move the damaged carton and was not injured.   When the carton was located, it was placed in a recovery drum and removed off the dock. Our Hazmat clean up company arrived that after noon to pack the damaged product in recovery drums. The dock doors were all raised and the trailer was pulled away from the dock to ventilate. None of the product leaked on the trailer, dock or ground.",The sole and proximate cause of the damage was attributed to the lack of adequate blocking and bracing.

The shipment in question was being transported under Polar Air Cargo AWB No. 403-7123-4601, from Chicago, Illinois, USA to Prestwick, Ireland. The spill was discovered at the Alliance Chicago warehouse facility after it had been off-loaded from the Eagle Global Logistics truck which had transported it from the aforementioned shipper. Shipment arrived at the Alliance cargo warehouse at ORD at 11:17AM on 01 August 2005, and was transferred from the truck to the cargo warehouse, a DG acceptance check was performed on the box and no leakage at that time was noticed, the box was placed at DG area waiting for build-up to a pallet.     Shipment was overpacked in a fiberboard box, at 11:50AM when the warehouse agent went to the DG storage area to start the build-up he noticed a damp spot on the overpack, he immediately notified the warehouse supervisor, Jeff Soto, who as per procedure checked Emergency Response Guide Book and had the building evacuated and contacted the Franklin Park Fire Department and HazChem (Polar's contracted hazmat Spill Clean-up Company), this occurred at/or about 12:00PM.    The Fire Department arrived at 12:33; they 12 persons who had been possibly exposed to the hazmat were taken to the hospital for observation and released. The Fire Department contacted the EGVFD Hazmat team who arrived at the scene shortly, a test of the air in the warehouse was conducted and found to be normal, and the spill was cleaned up and placed in the salvage packaging by HazChem who took the damaged piece to their warehouse to be held for inspection and further reports by authorities.    From the reports received from HazChem it appears the safety cap on the steel drum was dented and allowed the leakage of the material.","The item was in an overpacking with cushioning material by the shipper. The shipment was packaged according to the packing instruction for the material transported. As we as an airline cannot open up packages without compromising the integrity of the package/overpackage to see what is inside or if it is properly packaged according to the regulations. The only way we could have know about the damaged seal was to open up the package, and as an airline we trust our customers to give us a shipment which is in the proper condition for air transport as per the statement the shipper signs on the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods.",Yes,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,Federal Highway Administration (FHWA),,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,32,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,8500,Polar Air Cargo,US,

As Behunin entered the intersection at 15th East he was struck on the passenger side by a 1995 Ford pickup, WY license #195CS, which had run the west bound stop sign. The impact pushed Behunin into the southbound traffic lane where he was impacted by a 2003 Honda VT750DC motorcycle, ID license number MJJ484.    The impact resulted in the Apria truck coming to rest on it’s passenger side. The pickup was in the intersection and the motorcycle was off the road on the northwest side of the intersection. The motorcycle rider, Scott Garner was pronounced deceased at the scene.    As a result of the impact and Behunin’s truck coming to rest on it’s side there were numerous cylinders or Oxygen, compressed strewn around the accident scene, none of which were damaged to the extent that there was any release of contents. The truck also contained a permanently mounted non-specification  cryogenic cargo tank containing approximately 200 gallons of Oxygen, refrigerated liquid. The integrity of the cargo tank was not compromised but due to it’s orientation when the vehicle came to rest there was a  release of approximately 55 gallons  of Oxygen, refrigerated liquid through the venting system. When the vehicle came to rest the cargo tank was sitting with the end of the tank where the control panel and vent lines are located.    Under the supervision of the of the Idaho Falls Police and Fire Departments, Apria personnel who responded to the scene collected all of the cylinder of Oxygen, compressed that had been released during the impact and those that remained in the vehicle. Once the cylinders had been recovered the truck was righted and the minor release of Oxygen, refrigerated liquid ceased.    There were no injuries as a result of the hazardous material. There was no clean up required as a result of the hazardous material release. The road closure was due to the damaged vehicles and the non-hazmat related fatality investigation.    This incident was reported to the National Response Center, case #770373, due to the initial report received stating that there was a fatality and that a hazmat release had occurred and the roadway had been shut down.",None,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,0,"Apria Healthcare, Inc.",US,

He backed into the open outdoor loading dock and was greeted by a Ciba Colors employee who was to offload his freight. After lifting the rear door to the trailer he immediately noticed a pungent odor and a cloud had formed inside the trailer.  They backed away from the trailer and summoned the Ciba on-site haz-mat team.  After the hazardous material response team geared up with their personal protective equipment they proceeded to vent the trailer by opening the side door.  When entering the trailer they discovered a tote of Nitric Acid had been leaking from the man way lid on top of the tote.  The lid was secured but the gasket between the tote and the tightening ring had snapped and was partially hanging out.  This is where the Nitric Acid had escaped from the tote.  The response team estimated approximately 1 gallon of material leaked down the sides of the tote, onto the trailer floor and sipped onto the rear axle of the trailer.  A few ounces of liquid also found its way to the ground.  The Ciba response team, which consisted of six men, cleaned the inside of the trailer, the top of the leaking Nitric tote and the ground below with a couple bags of soda ash.  They removed the leaking tote of Nitric Acid and the rest of their order which was 1 other tote (Cyclohexane 99.8%) to an outside location where the totes were rinsed with water.  The response team also rinsed the rear tandem of the trailer with water. When the trailer returned to the Morrisville facility it was vented and looked at by the local mechanics.    Ciba Color, requested Univar send a replacement gasket to replace the torn gasket.  Operations supervisor, Rob Frantz, was sent to the customer’s location with two replacement gaskets and a new tightening ring.  The first replacement gasket malfunctioned and snapped before getting it on the tote.  The second gasket was placed on the tote with no problem and the tightening ring was not needed.  While on site, Rob Frantz, had asked an employee of Ciba Color to weigh the tote.  He discovered even with the loss of material the tote was overweight by approximately 5 pounds.    The investigation revealed a few problem areas.  The cause of the incident was package failure.  According to Charly Bonnie the Regional Operations Manager the gasket in place was not equipped to handle Nitric Acid.  The black rubber gasket had deteriorated to the point of snapping.  The proper gasket type for this material is Teflon coated.  According to a Clawson Container representative the ring around the man way entrance on the tote was stainless steel.  The ring appeared to be worn with age but was not considered a contributing factor.   The filling checklist for tote # MV01733 revealed the tote was filled on 8/1/05 and inspected in April of 2005.",Teflon gaskets and new tightening rings have been ordered and they will be placed on all current totes at the time of refilling.  The incident investigation will be distributed throughout the region in order to make any necessary changes at other facilities that handle Nitric acid.,No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA,US,

Mr. Jackson had one passenger, Rodney Jackson, in the vehicle with him. Mr. Daniel Jackson had been working in Ochlocknee, GA and was traveling back to Moultrie GA to pump off Reeves’ distributor. It was raining heavily as Mr. Jackson approached a very sharp right hand curve.  The speed limit had been reduced from 55mph to 45mph and then to 35mph. Mr. Jackson was unaware of the speed reduction and the approaching curve. Mr. Jackson applied the brakes just before the curve (122 feet of driver’s side front tire skids were found on scene).  The rear tires of the distributor made a slide to the right and then back to the left crossing the center line. Unit # 1114 then slid sideways down the roadway approximately 30 feet, flipped onto the driver’s side and then onto it’s roof. Once on its roof, unit #1114 slid 22 feet to final rest. Approximately 100 gallons of liquid asphalt leaked out. A dirt containment area was built to stop any liquid AC from entering  the ditch.",Train employees in defensive driving.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,20800,,,
