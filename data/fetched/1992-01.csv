DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS: A DUMP TRAILER CONTAINING K071/5106 WASTE WAS ENROUTE TO STABLEX, LOCATED IN QUEBEC, CANADA FROM CLEAN HARBORS OF BRAINTREE, INC. LOCATED AT 385 QUINCY AVENUE BRAINTREE, MA  02184 ON JANUARY 22, 1991.  UPON EXIT FROM THE CLEAN HARBORS FACILITY, THE LOAD WAS CHECKED AN NO FREE LIQUIDS WERE PRESENT.  ON THE MORNING OF 1/23/92, THE DRIVER CONDUCTED HIS PRE-TRIP INSPECTION AND NOTICED 2 DRIPS COMING FROM THE TAILGATE OF THIS VEHICLE.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY PLACED 5 GALLON PAILS UNDER THE TAILGATE TO COLLECT ANY PRODUCT THAT ESCAPED FROM THE VEHICLE.  HE THEN CONTACTED HIS DISPATCHER WHO IN TURN NOTIFIED BOTH THE STATE OF VERMONT AND THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER.  THE RESPONSE CENTER ISSUED THE ABOVE MENTIONED INCIDENT REPORT #104223.  AFTER THE DRIVER CONTACTED HIS DISPATCHER, HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO NOTIFY THE MANAGEMENT OF THE WAGON WHEEL TRUCK STOP AT EXIT 19 ON I-89 OF THE INCIDENT.  THE MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUCK STOP ASKED THAT THEY BE KEPT INFORMED OF THE PROGRESS OF THE CLEAN-UP.  A CREW OF RESPONDERS WERE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED FROM THE CLEAN HARBORS, ALBANY, NY SERVICE CENTER.  UPON ARRIVAL OF THE CREW FROM ALBANY, THEY PLACED ADDITIONAL POLY SHEETING UNDER THE VEHICLE AND INSPECTED THE LOAD. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT IN TRANSIT, RESIDUAL LIQUIDS HAD SEPARATED FROM THE LOAD.  ABSORBENT MATERIALS WERE SHOVELED INTO THE DUMP TRAILER NEAR THE REAR TAILGATE AREA.  A CAULKING COMPOUND WAS ALSO APPLIED TO THE SEAL OF THE DOOR AS AN ADDED MEASURE OF PROTECTION.  THIS, HOWEVER, DID NOT EFFECTIVELY SEAL THE REAR TAILGATE.  THE CREW THEN PROCEEDED TO SHOVEL THE MATERIAL AWAY FROM THE TAILGATE AND ADDED A CEMENT COMPOUND THAT WHEN MIXED WITH THE LOAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE LIQUID CONTENT IN THE TRAILER.  ADDITIONAL ABSORBENT MATERIAL WAS ALSO ADDED TO THE LOAD TO ABSORB ANY REMAINING MOISTURE.  THE LOAD WAS THEN OBSERVED AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE STOPPED LEAKING.  ALL THE ABSORBENT MATERIAL THAT WAS USED DURING THE RESPONSE WAS ADDED TO THE LOAD AND THE VEHICLE PROCEEDED ON ITS WAY TO THE ORIGINAL DESTINATION. STEPS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO INSURE THAT THIS SITUATION DOES NOT REOCCUR INCLUDE: 1) INSPECTION OF MATERIAL PRIOR TO LOADING TO INSURE THAT THERE IS NO LIQUID CONTENT THAT COULD SEPARATE DURING TRANSPORTATION. 2) INSPECTION OF ALL GASKETS TO INSURE A PROPER SEAL. 3) ADDITION OF A LAYER OF SPEEDI DRY OR OTHER SUITABLE ABSORBENT MATERIAL USED AS AN ADDED MEASURE OF PROTECTION TO ABSORB ANY RESIDUAL LIQUIDS THAT DO SEPARATE DURING TRANSIT.",,No,HOPPER,Highway hopper trailer for solid materials only,HOPPER T,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8125,,US,

AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, HE DISCOVERED THAT A 55 GAL DRUM IN THE ERY BACK OF THE TRAILER WAS THE LEAKER. HE PROCEEDED TO STOP THE LEAK BY TURNING THE DRUM ON ITS SIDE. THE TRUCK WAS EQUIPPED WITH A SPILL KIT AND DRIVER, PAUL DERISI, HAS BEEN 40HR SARA/OSHA TRAINED AND DOT TRAINED FOR THE SAFE TRANSPORT OF HAZMAT. HE APPLIED SPEEDY DRY AND ABSORBENTS TO CONTAIN THE SPILL. ONCE THE SPILL WAS CONTAINED, HE CALLED THE CLEAN VENTURE, INC. SUPV ON CALL CHARLIE LAKATOS. AN EMERG RESPONSE CREW FROM CLEAN VENTURE RESPONDED WITHIN 3HRS WITH MANPOWER AND EQUIPMENT TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL. WE NOTIFIED THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES OF THE SITUATION. LUZERNE COUNTY HAZMAT AND FIREMEN WERE ON THE SITE TO ASSIST US. AT 8:00AM THE PA DEPT OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES WAS CALLED AT 1-717-787-7381 BY BETTY SEAMAN, THE TRANSPORTATION CLERK IN THE PERTH AMBOY OFFICE. THE PERSON WHOM TO SPEAK WITH WAS NOT INT THE OFFICE YET. SHE LEFT THE COMPANY NAME, HER NAME & PHONE NUMBER AND A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SPILL. AT 8:25AM STAN LEHMAN FROM THE PA DEPT OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES RETURNED HER CALL. SHE EXPLAINED THE SITUATION. HE HAD ASKED WHAT OUR PROCEDURES WERE GOING TO BE TO CLEAN SPILL. HER RESPONSE WAS THE CREW WOULD OVERPACK THE DRUMS AND CLEAN SPILL MATERIAL INTO ANOTHER DRUM AND DISPOSE OF THE SPILL MATERIAL PROPERLY. HE TOLD HER THAT WE SEEM TO HAVE EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL AND IF ANY PROBLEMS SHOULD ARISE TO CONTACT HIM AT 1-717-826-2553. WHILE CLEANING THE SPILL IN THE TRAILER WE FOUND ANOTHER DRUM OF THE SAME MATERIAL LEAKING. WE PUT CAUTION TAPE AROUND CONTAMINATED AREAS, OVERPACKED THE 2 LEAKING DRUMS, DECONTAMINATED THE TRAILER AND CLEANED THE SPILLED MATERIAL FROM THE ROAD. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE CLEAN UP, A TOTAL OF THREE 55 GAL DRUMS WERE GENERATED BY THE CONTAMINATED SPILL DEBRIS.
