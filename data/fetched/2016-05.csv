Upon inspecting the shipment approximately 30 minutes after the arrival of the truck, a leak was discovered to be coming from the back of the trailer.  Further investigation showed a leaking drum located toward the middle of the truck.  The drum was observed to have a horizontal crease approximately 4 inches long and located 4 inches from the bottom with a small hole at one edge of the crease which release about 20% of its contents.  Based on the location and description of the damage, and the knowledge that a tote was loaded immediately following, it was surmised that this drum must have been damaged by a forklift during loading of the tote into the trailer.  Confirmation measurements of the width of the tote and length of the forklift tines confirmed that the forklift tines were approximately 3-4"" longer than the width of the tote.  The drum was over-packed into an 85 gal salvage drum with absorbent cushioning.  The spilled material was absorbed with floor dry.","As this spill was caused by a forklift in the course of loading with the operator not realizing that the tines of the forklift had exceeded the tote he was moving and resulting in puncturing this drum, retraining and operator awareness will occur at both the Veolia Kent and Vancouver, WA locations.",No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1500,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

The railcar, a Methyl Methacrylate Monomer load, was isolated for further investigation.  KCS Environmental & Hazmat dispatched an emergency response contractor to conduct air monitoring and investigate the railcar.       Responders reported that the leak originated from a loose packing gland on the liquid valve. The packing gland was tightened to stop the leak. Total amount released estimated at 3 gallons. All released material evaporated quickly.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

KCS Environmental + Hazmat Department dispatched an emergency response contractor to assess the railcar and affect proper securement.

The valve and secondary closure plug were secured.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.

Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

CELLUCCI,"SVP HEALTH, SAFETY AND TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",42 Longwater Drive,Norwell,MA,02061,Carrier,The incident captioned in this report occurred on 04/15/2016. The incident was not reported until 05/05/2016 due to a breakdown in the internal spill reporting protocol at the local level. This failure has been addressed and corrected. This shipment was fron a HHW pick-up and was exempt according to Washington State law. After picking up the material from its origin the driver noticed one of the drums had leaked a small amount of liquid onto the floor of his truck upon arriving at the next stop. The driver immediately cleaned up the spill and over packed the leaking drom at that site. After remediation the driver continued with his route but failed to report the incident to his superiors. These issues have been addressed as well. The material was subsequently disposed of at its original disposal destination without further incident.,The delay in reporting is a result of misunderstanding and misconception regarding the spill reporting protocol. Thorough inspection of containers and pallets will be reinforced with drivers and warehouse personnel. Spill reporting protocol has been discussed and strongly reinforced with all parties to this incident.

Upon arrival, the responder noted the same. The responder climbed the car and noted liquid coming from the combination housing. The original seal was intact. The seal was cut and the housing cover opened. Product was noted as to be coming from a slightly opened liquid valve with a missing closure plug. The plug was noted as to be laying on top of the pressure plate next to the liquid valve. The valve was closed and the leak subsided. It was noted that the handle for the liquid valve was turned past parallel with the pressure plate and the stop tab slightly bent from too much force being utilized upon closure.   The handle was removed by the responder and the stop tab moved back to its original location. The liquid plug was cleaned, re-taped with Teflon tape, and tool tightened. After that was completed, the vapor valve plug was checked and was removed by hand. That plug was removed, cleaned, re-taped with Teflon tape, and tool tightened.

Local fire and police responded to secure the area.  Inspection of the car revealed a steady drip of product leaking from the bottom washout plate. A containment pool was placed to capture leaking product.  Tightening of four nuts which secured the washout plate approximately one half turn each slowed the release, but did not stop it. Remaining residue product in car was recovered with a vacuum truck.  Upon removal of all product, car was set out for further handling by the leaser of the car.  On 6-2-15, Rescar mobile rail repair removed the washout cover plate, and determined the gasket was too small in diameter.  Additionally, the internal washout plug was loose, not wrench tight. An appropriately sized gasket was positioned on the washout cover plate and then secured to the car.  The shipper will apply for an OTMA and car will be home shopped for further inspection and repairs.  It should be noted that the car was on its first trip after being shopped for liner inspection and repainting.  Magnetic tape was also noted covering the commodity name on left and rights sides of the car, and has been been removed.","Conduct proper pre and post inspection of car upon completion of loading or unloading, to ensure all valves, fittings and closures are in a closed and secure condition preventing release of liquid, vapor or gas while car is in transportation.",Yes,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,4200,Union Pacific Railroad,US,

Upon arrival onsite, tanker was in tact with product only releasing from the vapor recovery tube on tanker. Saddle tanks were also intact, with release from fuel cap while vehicle was on its side, and motor oil releasing from the engine. Erwin Bros Trucking dispatched a recovery tanker to offload tanker. ISR dyked the area, as a precautionary measure, to prevent migration. Upon completion of offload and recovery of vehicle, ISR excavated the impacted soil beneath the vehicle.Area was scraped per visual and olfactory observation.

Inspection revealed the bottom outlet valve cap to be loose 1 turn.  Additionally, the welded seal rod bracket which secures the valve operating handle in the closed position was broken, and not attached to the bottom of the car.  This failure caused the valve to vibrate open allowing product to leak. The bottom outlet ball valve was closed, and the cap was tightened 1 turn which secured the car from further release.  The shipper dispatched Rescar to remove the valve operating handle so it would not vibrate open.  Car was then released and placed back into transportation.

Mechanical Hazmat crews responded to inspect the car and found it to be venting normally at the time of inspection.  In reviewing the camera footage, it was noted that the venting was not normal.  The cabinets were opened to obtain car pressure.  Current pressure was at 57 psi, the Safety Relief Valve (SRV) is designed to open at 60 psi.  It was determined in consultation with Linde personnel that the SRV was activating due to high internal pressures.  The car was isolated and on 5/26/16, Linde personnel vented the car to bring pressures down to 15 psi.  Another release through the SRV was not reported from the time of the inspection on 5/25/16 and when the car's pressure was lowered.

On May 31, 2016, PNNL's Hazardous Material Transportation Officer (HMTO) became aware of the transport and recognized it met the definition of undeclared hazardous material.  The HMTO reported the error to the PNNL Operations Center, which initiated communications to others responsible to evaluate compliance, reporting and corrective actions.  Although the Pelican case met excepted packaging criteria, it lacked the required UN2911 marking.  In addition, the staff member who had prepared and transported the package lacked the required DOT training.  There was no package failure and no release.  The HMTO went to the staff member's home, prepared a compliant package, and returned the regulated items to PNNL.","Existing PNNL procedures require that staff identify all materials (hazardous or not) to be shipped and obtain services of qualified staff to prepare/ship hazmat, and that staff who participate in hazmat operations receive hazmat employee training.  If the staff are unsure whether hazards are present, they must contact a hazmat shipper for review.  PNNL's orientation and annual refresher for all staff include information about the regulated nature of hazardous materials in transportation and the need for hazmat employee training for certain operations.  PNNL also regularly publishes communications to all staff to raise awareness of hidden hazards in transportation.  Both the trainings and the regular communications specifically identify smoke detectors, lithium batteries and other common commercial commodities that are DOT regulated when shipped in commerce.  Regardless, it did not register with the staff member that the contents were regulated.    In accordance with Department of Energy requirements, PNNL has initiated a critique, an extent-of-condition review, and a causal analysis to identify contributing factors and means to prevent recurrence.  This process is not yet complete.  The staff member has since completed general awareness, safety and security awareness training, and is scheduled to complete function-specific training.  Management has reinforced requirements to other project staff.    Because the public may lack an understanding of hazardous materials and requirements associated with consumer commodities, there may be a misperception that there are no special requirements when shipping those materials by US Postal Service or commercial carriers, or when otherwise transported in commerce.  Including more detailed information regarding the presence of hazards and the limits of transport on packagings might help raise awareness.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,US,

ERTS was contacted at 07:00 and dispatched Patriot Environmental to remediate leaking condition. Contractor arrived on site at 11:00.  Interior inspection revealed mixed freight loaded in two rows with a second layer throughout. Some second layer pallets were resting on ETrack bars  while others were resting directly onto base units. No load securement was observed anywhere within this shipment.  Contractor identified the cause of the leaking condition to be a pallet of batteries approximately 1/3 back from the nose of the trailer on the right side that  slid off of base unit and came to rest on its side. All batteries on the pallet remained in place but were lying horizontal, allowing acid to leak. Acid leaked  onto and through the floor of the trailer.  Contractor unloaded and cleaned cargo pallets, cleaned trailer, then reloaded cargo. Contractor also cleaned affected ground area. Hazmat waste from  this incident was removed by Patriot Environmental. Job was completed and contractor departed at 18:00.
