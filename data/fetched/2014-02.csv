He exited I 94 and parked on the entrance ramp and contacted 911. Response was by Eau Claire County Sheriff, WI State Patrol, Hixton and Black River Falls Fire Departments, WI DNR and WI Regional Hazmat Response. Carrier contacted Bay West Environmental Services of St Paul MN for containment and cleanup.    Two persons were evacuated for about 2 hours from a home downhill and downwind as a precautionary measure. Bay West personnel removed the and placed the drum in an overpack container. The drum showed damage on the bottom from what appears to be a hit by a forklift. It appears that during transit, the damage caused a small crack to occur, thus releasing about 14 gallons of flammable liquid. It was estimated by the response and spill cleanup teams that only a small amount leaked out after the truck stopped.    Cleanup personnel from Bay West Environmental Services cleaned up the absorbents and all contaminated snow. Since the ground is frozen and snow covered, no material reached the soil.    No on site decontamination of the vehicle was deemed necessary. The load was delivered and Bay West Environmental was contracted to dispose of the contaminated snow and absorbent waste.","Since this incident was caused by hidden damage to the container, it is difficult, as a carrier, to do anything to prevent this from occurring.

After the load picked up, the unit was involved in a non-preventable accident, hit by another vehicle; a post-crash inspection was conducted by law enforcement.  The inspection report listed violations for no placards displayed and stated the load did not qualify for the battery exception due to exposed terminals, poor packaging and poor securement.  The load was reworked, rebraced and re-powered by JBH.  Photos confirm the PD's assessment; the cargo was not properly braced by the shipper.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Sasol North America was notified via CHEMTREC report number 2014-0203-00176.  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the cause of the release was due to the liquid line valve closure plug being less than tool tight.  In addition, product was found above the ball valve indicating that the liquid line valve may be defective.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to Sasols representative Terry Dohrer at 281-588-3334.  Contractor personnel removed the closure plug, applied Teflon tape and re-installed the plug with a wrench to secure the release.  Due to the fact that this container may have a defective valve the tank car was placed in bad order status until the shipper obtains a One Time Movement Approval.  This incident did require a special switching move.

While the transfer was being conducted, a 2 inch x 5 inch section of the hose burst due to a blockage in the line. Approximately 20 gallons of material released onto a 33' x 18' area of gravel parking lot and an environmental contractor was dispatched to the site immediately for impact assessment and initial response.

UTLX 209585 was set-out from its train and carefully moved to isolation at the facility's repair track. On 2/14/2014, contract responders inspected UTLX 209585 and reported finding commodity bubbling at the threaded VRV fitting. UTLX 209585 was depressurized and the VRV was removed. During VRV removal, minor galling at the thread surface was reported and cross-threading allowed commodity to escape at the VRV orifice. The threaded area of the VRV was inspected and cleaned. The VRV was re-installed and tool tightened. The valve housing cover was closed and sealed with seal HMRI 00340. Response was concluded at 1330 hrs.

Appropriate notifications were made and emergency responders activated.    Upon arrival, the responders accessed the tank car and noted the top operated bottom outlet valve was in the open position. The bottom outlet valve took one and one half (1 ) turns to close tight. The shipper had the bottom outlet valve handle sealed in the open position. Also, the bottom outlet secondary closure cap was not tool tight, taking approx. a half () turn. It was noted that the bottom outlet valve stem packing was not properly sealed/tight and was also leaking.     The responders closed the tank car appurtenances tool tight, verified securement of the tank car, and notified appropriate personnel that the tank car is ready to safely return back into transportation.    * No injuries reported    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels.

Appropriate notifications were made and emergency responders activated.  Once the tank car was isolated and secured emergency responders accessed the tank car to assess the leak. Upon further inspection it was noted that the source of the leak was a ~34 inch crack in the tank shell and gusset plates at the stub sill weld area. A containment pool was installed, and a small suction initiated on the tank car to slow down any leaks. The tank car required a field transfer of the lading.  Tank car UTLX 667874 was secured to be the receiving car for field transfer of lading. On 2/14/14 a transfer of the lading was completed, car was purged and cleaned and the inside condition of the car inspected.     * No injuries reported    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier.

A receptacle was placed under GATX 47185 to catch the ebbing commodity drips. Contract responders inspected GATX 47185 and reported the safety vent's 165 psi frangible disc had ruptured allowing commodity to escape at the disc's opening. Also, the Salco safety vent housing's 'quick inspect body' had damage near the top cap connection which required replacement. The responders replaced the ruptured frangible disc and the damaged safety vent. Absorbent material was applied to observed ground spillage areas and later collected for disposal. Other observed spillage was neutralized with an acetic acid/water solution. All other valves and fittings were found secure. Intact shipper seals ASH072704 and 072710 were replaced by seals HMRI00456, 00457 and 00458. Response was concluded by 1345 hrs.

During the course of the trip, the driver conducted a routine load check and discovered a small amount of material coming from the rear door seal of the vacuum box container leaking onto the trailer fender. The driver immediately placed a containment pail under the rear door and contacted his home dispatcher to request a response crew. Upon notification, a response crew was summoned, donned the appropriate personal protective equipment, removed the released material and placed it back into the vacuum box, tightened the rear door which stopped the leak: a containment diaper was secured to the vacuum box as an added measure. The shipment continued on to the disposal destination.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking or damage was observed. Upon inspection at the Clean Harbors' Kimball, NE facility it was determined the vacuum box was leaking due to the presence of free liquid. In order to prevent a recurrence, the initial shipper has been notified of the improper preparation and presence of free liquids in a solid waste stream, the driver has been re-instructed to perform a comprehensive inspection of the container's body along with the closure device to identify any potential issues before transportation.

No injuries reported. KCS employee made appropriate notifications and emergency responders activated.     Upon further inspection it was noted that the leak source was from a top-operated bottom outlet valve found slightly open, no gasket in place, and a bottom outlet cap less than tool tight. The responder contained the leaked lading, applied gasket to the bottom outlet cap, and tightened to tool tightness. However, the top operated bottom outlet valve would not close fully despite responder's closing efforts. This tank car appurtenance has been deemed defective and will require OTMA to home shop, clean and purge car, and repair defect.    * No injuries reported    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.      (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O. Box 219335, Kansas City, MO 64121.  The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

CBTX 735229 was carefully set-out from its train and isolated in the railyard for inspection. On 2/27/2014, contract responders inspecting CBTX 735229 reported finding one manway securement bolt/nut loose which was the leak cause. Inspection of the manway gasket condition revealed a small tear in the gasket and a new manway nozzle gasket was applied. The gasket tear did not appear to be a contributing factor of the manway closure leak. All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure. Afterwards, the manway closure was properly secured and the spillage on CBTX 735229's side shell was cleaned. No ground impact from spillage was reported. Response was concluded by 1200 hrs.

He parked his set in the yard and came in the building to punch in.  A local Sheboygan driver went out in the yard to split the set.  At that time he noticed the trailer 68966 was leaking fluid.  Trailer   68966 was a full exclusive use trailer load of 12 totes of Ethanol Solutions.  This trailer was loaded and sealed at the shipper location in KY.  The local ABF driver, Frank Schneider, called the branch manager at home to inform of the situation and find out what to do.  Frank was instructed to cal  l the ABF 1-800 Safety and Security hotline immediately.  He called the Safety line and they instructed him to control the spill from going into the street until a hazardous materials team could arrive.  SET Environmental Inc from Oak Creek, WI responded to the scene by 2230.  They assessed the situ  ation and cleaned up the spill by 0400 on Feb 12th.  Upon their arrival they broke the trailer seal #05642 and cut off the trailer lock.  They found the tote on the back of the trailer was the one leaking.  They emptied the remaining contents from the tote into two 55 gallon recovery drums.  Next th  ey cleaned up the ethanol that spilled on the ground and put that into 3 recovery drums.  The Haz Mat team broke the top seal on the tote but left the bottom seal intact.  They inspected the tote that leaked and came to the conclusion that the valve on the tote was faulty.  They inspected the surrou  nding streets to see if there was any contamination in the street but found none.  The only contamination was in the ABF yard.  All totes were transferred to another trailer and inspected for contamination.  The shipment was able to be offered for delivery on Feb. 12th.

Upon notification, a Clean Harbors response crew was dispatched to the scene where the response crew tighted the rear door which stopped the leak and added the spill material back into the vac box. The Mass DEP was notified (report 4-25014)Management discovered the product was mostly liquid as the shipping description dictated. It was decided to transfer the product to a Cusco (coded) vacuum tanker and transport to the disposal facility in two separate loads which was executed with no further incident.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking or damage was observed. Upon inspection at the Clean Harbors facility it was determined the vacuum box was leaking from the a comprimised gasket.

ETNU 140853 was carefully removed from its railcar and isolated at the facility's containment area. No commodity was observed leaking during this time and no commodity residue was observed on its inbound intermodal railcar. Contract responders inspecting ETNU 140853 reported finding approx. 12 oz. of commodity liquid between ETNU 140853's closed external bottom outlet valve and its closure cap (dust cap). This commodity was absorbed and cleaned. Afterwards the BOV was monitored with no observed accumulation of commodity at the BOV. Teflon tape was applied to the threaded areas of the bottom outlet to ensure a good seal after the dust cap was re-secured. Response was concluded by 1640 hrs. CST 2/19/2014.

Three Barton Solvents employees were sent to the scene shortly after the accident happened. They arrived at the scene about 2 hours later. We were able to stop the leaking caps by tightening them. The rest of the product on the trailer was pumped into another Barton trailer that arrived at the scene. Eagle Environmental was called in to handle the clean up.

I Incident Date:  February 3, 20 14    Our driver had loaded his transport at Marathon Petroleum  Co. LP facility at 40 IS River Rd. in Cincinnati and was enroot  to destination traveling EB on River Road (US Rt. 50) when driver of an automobile  lost control and crossed center  line striking our vehicle on drivers side tractor tandem  axles and down along left side of trailer.  Our driver attempted to veer right from oncoming car as he was struck.  The tractor of our tractor/trailer transport struck light pole, along side of roadway and from the impact of the other  car and the striking of the pole our trailer then flipped over onto the top rails of the trailer landing on roadway.  During this activity the fifth wheel mounting was separated from the tractor frame mounting area with the fifth wheel  plate remaining hooked  to the trailer.  During to rollover/flipping process the driver's side front compartment of trailer appears to have struck the rear frame rail of our tractor and a gouge/ripped  area in the barrel skin of the trailer resulted.   Fuel evacuated from the gouged area of the trailer front compartment onto the roadway.  Duration of spill lasted approximately  30 minutes.  The Cincinnati Fire Department responded  the accident scene and attempted to slow flow of product from gouge with  a mastic material as well as applied foam onto the fuel spillage area and attempted to cordon  off and contain the spill area.  We retained services of Environmental Services, Inc. to respond to site and effect containment  and clean up  of the fuel discharge areas.  OHIO  EPA responded  with representative, Bill Lohner, to site and he directed  clean-up activities, assessed situation with City of Cincinnati MSD for fuel that had entered into storm  water  drains and also inspected adjacent Ohio River for any possible fuel impact.   Our maintenance staff was brought in to effect the pumping out/transfer of the product that remained on the overturned trailer into another transport unit that we  had brought to site.  Wrecker company responded  with equipment  to right and transport our tractor trailer transport unit to storage  holding lot post the accident.  The primary remediation  of the spill was completed  and the roadway was re-opened around 7:45 am.  Environmental Enterprises,  Inc. remained on site to facilitate balance of remediation  activities for duration of the morning.","Part VII- Recommendations/Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence    This incident was caused by actions of another vehicle when the driver lost control, crossed  the center  line of the roadway and struck our transport unit causing the crash and resultant rollover of our trailer and spillage that resulted when the trailer appeared  to strike the back frame rail of the tractor during the rollover.  The integrity of the trailer, other  than the gouged area, was maintained.  No leakage occurred  from and piping, valves, lids or alike of the trailer.  The gauge thickness of the trailer is the industry standard; and again was only compromised by the impact with the frame rail of the tractor during the rollover of the unit. Our driver reacted  and managed to avoid a complete head-on impact, but due to the impact of the other vehicle did strike and come to rest with our tractor against the utility pole and as noted above the tractor trailer became disengaged the trailer rolled/flipped over onto its top rails landing within I    foot of the rear of the tractor.        NOTE: Pictures are attached  showing alignment of the tractor  trailer unit post the impact as well as the gouged area of the front trailer compartment.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,231028,"LYKINS TRANSPORTATION, INC.",US,

Trailer 70651 was rejected by Sherry Ratliff due to an incorrect wash. Citgo was contacted and the driver (Manual Dunn) was sent out to get the correct wash.  Driver returned from Quala wash at 1:06pm, and he was sent to track three for loading. Operator Scott Yantes began setting up platform pump PLP1576 and verified the load. Mr. Yantes began transferring the Citgo Xylene (UN1307) from railcar GATX 50988 at approximately 1:45pm, when Operator Jared Davis noticed the product coming from the rear outlet valve. Mr. Davis immediately notified Scott, and at that time Mr. Yantes shut the pump down and noticed the rear cap on the trailer had come off. He quickly closed the valve and placed the cap back on the trailer.  Mr. Yantes and Mr. Davis immediately began containing the spill with absorbent and notified Ops Manager Don Driver about the spill. After containing the spill, it was determined approximately 20 gallons had spilled onto the asphalt. No storm drains or ballast were contacted during the release. In addition, there was no associated injury. Mr. Driver then contacted Randy Carter and John Donegan to report the release.  Mr. Driver then notified the US EPA region 5 spill response hotline, National Response Center and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Driver was given a reference number concerning the spill (1073887)  Terminal personnel cleaned up the area, placing the contaminated absorbent into trash cans then placing more absorbent down and bushing it into the asphalt to ensure they got all of the xylene. The terminal ended up with four cans of used absorbent, which will be disposed of in an appropriate matter.","1) Discuss with terminal personnel the importance of verifying all trailer valves are closed and capped prior to initiating a transfer; this shall be accomplished by completely walking around the tanker trailer during the pre transfer trailer inspection process.    2)  Discipline the involved employee and issue a performance improvment report emphasizing ensuring to conduct a thorough pretransfer trailer walk around inspection, and ensuring that the trailer's internal and external valves are closed and capped prior to commencing a transfer.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1500,Savage Services Corporation,US,

When he took the cap off, product ran out.  Driver immediately went to activate the emergency shut off valve on the cargo tank.  That slowed the flow enough to get the cap back on, but did not stop the spillage resulting in an approximate 25 gallon spill.  Spill went into a concrete containment area and was not released into the environment.   An emergency response team was called to clean up the spill and transfer the rest of the product into another trailer.","When empty, the cargo tank was inspected to see why the internal and external valve both failed which is very unusual.  It was discovered that the tip of a power washing wand was lodged in the internal valve preventing it from fulling closing.  There was no indication what would have caused the external valve to fail unless something was also lodged in there and was dislodged during the spill.  The tankwash has been notified of the incident and will follow up with proper training.  The driver also did not follow proper procedure.  If he had opened the bleeder valve before he took the cap off, he would have known there was product in the cavity and would not have removed the cap.

Both vehicles were headed toward milestone 27, which is a lease road going north. The vehicle in front braked suddenly causing the second vehicle to swerve to the right side of the roadway and go into the bar ditch. Upon entering the bar ditch the driver of the vehicle lost control causing it to roll three quarters of a turn. As the vehicle entered the bar ditch the vehicle declined from its original level position causing an imbalance in the rear of the vehicle. The vehicle then went into an inclined position “jumping” the front of the vehicle up onto the turn-off road. This forward momentum caused the front of the vehicle to “bounce” causing the vehicle to overturn onto its left side then roll onto its roof then came to a resting position on its right side facing in a north east direction. The overall damage caused the manway on the top of the tanker to break causing the diesel fuel to leak.","To mitigate the failure to maintain proper following distance and responding correctly to traffic conditions ahead the following recommendations/actions have been suggested to prevent future incidents.

When product started to flow, they noticed product leaking from the butterfly clamp on the QRB on the discharge valve of the trailer.  They attempted to tighten it to stop the leak and were unsuccessful.  They closed the internal and external valve planning to take the cargo tank in for service.  The customer tried to get the dripping to stop before going on the roadway and in the process, the assembly came apart completely.  The internal valve appeared to be closed but it wasn't and all attempts to close it failed.  Failure of both valves allows the contents of the trailer to empty to the diked concrete pad of the truck rack.  One plant employee received two small first degree chemical burns to the face and was treated onsite.  We brought in an emergency response team to clean up and dispose of the product.","The driver took full responsibility for the external valve failure.  He failed to do a proper pretrip inspection to make sure it was assembled correctly before the trailer was loaded.  He has since received remedial training.  Upon inspection of the trailer after the incident, it was found that the internal valve was dislodged.  We have never had this happen before and do not know what would have caused it to become dislodged.  The trailer had been in regular service with no issues.  The only  possible conclusion is that something occurred during a tankwash that dislodged it.

Dupre Logistics was acting as the carrier for material shipped by Univar to Oxy Permian.  The Dupre driver was pumping the material from the Dupre truck to an Oxy Permian tank, when the tank overflowed, releasing approximately 120 gallons of material into the concrete containment area below the tank.  The containment area is approximately 10 feet by 10 feet, and the material was approximately two inches deep.  Initial investigation revealed that the tank volume gauge was malfunctioning, and the gauge did not show that the tank was at capacity.  The Dupre driver terminated the transfer once the overflow was noticed.  No soils, storm drains or waterways were impacted by this release.

THE OVERFLOW OCCURED FOR LESS THAN ONE MINUTE AND RELEASED AN ESTIMATED 75 GALLONS OF SULFURIC ACID. NO ONE WAS INJURED FROM THIS INCIDENT. THIS INCIDENT WAS NOT CAUSED BY A MECHANICAL OR EQUIPMENT FAILURE (SEE THE ""NA"" IN PART III QUESTION 25) BUT RATHER BY HUMAN ERROR.

THE DRIVER'S FIRST STOP WAS AT THE NEIGHBOR'S, #159 LAKE ROAD, FAR HILLS, NJ TO FILL THEIR 2000 GALLON HEATING OIL TANK. HE COULD NOT FIND THE FILL PIPE DUE TO FOURTEEN PLUS INCHES OF SNOW. HE CONTINUED ON TO #135 LAKE ROAD WHERE HE ENCOUNTERED ICE DIRECTLY ABOVE WHERE THE SMALL CREEK FLOWS UNDER THE DRIVEWAY.      THE FRONT TRUCK TRIES GOT UP ON PACKED SNOW AND ICE ON BOTH EDGES OF BOTH PLOWED SNOW BANKS. THE PAVED DRIVEWAY AT THIS POINT DROPS ALMOST STRAIGHT DOWN ON BOTH SIDES, NO GAURDRAILS NOR EDGE MARKERS. I FEEL THE DRIVER WAS GOING TOO SLOW SINCE THE TRUCK SLID LITERALLY TO THE RIGHT, OFF THE PAVEMENT AND OVER APPROXIMATELY THREE-QUARTERS WHERE A TREE HELD IT FROM GOING TOTALLY OVER.    WHEN I GOT A CALL FROM THE OFFICE AND WAS TOLD WHAT THE DRIVER ADVISED, I IMMEDIATELY SAID TO CALL SOMERSET HILLS TOWING AND ADVISE OF THE SITUATION AND I WANT THEM THERE NOW, AND ALSO TO CALL FAR HILLS POLICE. UPON MY ARRIVAL AND SEEING THE SITUATION, I CALLED SSG/BARCO AND REQUESTED A FULL RESPONSE AND THE VAC TRUCK.  AT THIS POINT I COULD SEE A DIESEL FUEL DRIP COMING FROM THE FUEL WATER SEPARATOR NEXT TO THE ENGINE DIESEL FUEL TANK AND WAS ABLE TO PUT A FIVE GALLON BUCKET UNDER TO CATCH TO DRIP. WE COULD NOT ACCESS THE PASSENGER SIDE TOOLBOX NOR INSIDE CAB FOR SORBENTS. I THEN CALLED OUR OFFICE TO HAVE SOMEONE LOAD OUR PICKUP WITH OUR SORBENTS AND BOOMS AND TRANSPORT TO THE SITE, AND TO LEAVE THE PLOW ON THE TRUCK SINCE THE DRIVEWAY WOULD HAVE TO BE WIDENED TO GET THE EQUIPMENT IN. DURING THIS TIME I HAD OUR OTHER TRUCK GO TO NEIGHBOR'S TO FIND THEIR OIL FILL TO EMPTY OUT SINCE WE NEEDED TO PUMP FROM ONE TRUCK TO ANOTHER AT SOME POINT.    ON OUR DELIVERY TRUCKS WE HAVE BOTTOM PUMP OFF OUTLETS. THE OUTLET WAS ACCESSIBLE, BUT WE COULD NOT DO THE PUMP OFF SAFELY UNTIL THE TRACK WAS CABLED BY WRECKERS.  AT THIS POINT THE OWNER OF SOMERSET HILLS TOWING, MIKE BESSASPARIS HAD CONCERNS THT HIS BIGGEST WRECKER MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE, AND HE WOULD LIKE TO ALSO CALL IN A FRIEND WHO HAD ONE WITH A ROTATOR BOOM. I AGREED SINCE THE LOAD WAS STILL INTACT AND WE WANTED TO KEEP THE TRUCK AND TANK WITH THE MINIMAL DAMAGE WHICH HAD ALREADY HAPPENED.    BOTH SOMERSET COUNTY HAZMAT AND NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WERE ON-SITE AND WE HAD A DISCUSSION ON HOW I WANTED TO PUMP OFF THE PRODUCT FROM THE TRUCK. I WANTED TO USE THE BOTTOM PUMP OFF, HOOK SSG/BARCO VAC TRUCK, PULL OUR DELIVERY HOSE ABOVE THE VAC TRUCK TO CREATE ""AIR"" AND BEGIN TO EMPTY, BUT IT WOULD FORCE BARCO TO MAKE TWO (2) TRIPS BACK TO OUR BULK PLANT (ABOUT TEN MINUTES AWAY).  THE ON-SITE NEW JERSEY D.E.P. SAID IT WOULD TAKE TOO LONG AND WANTED ME TO CALL IN ""KEN'S MARINE SERVICE"" FROM BAYONNE, NJ WHICH IS AN HOUR AWAY. I DID, AT THEIR REQUEST. WHILE WAITING I USED OUR PICKUP TO WIDEN THE DRIVE OF SNOW, THEN WE BROUGHT IN ANOTHER COMPANY TO SALT THE DRIVE.    THE ROTATOR BOOM WRECKER ARRIVED AND ONCE THE DRIVE WAS SALTED, THE ROTATOR",#1 HAVE EVERY SMALL FUEL TRUCK HAVE BOTTOM PUMP OFF.
