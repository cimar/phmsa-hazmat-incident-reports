A SMALL AMOUNT (APPROX 2 CUPS) OF THE 31% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE LIQUID CARGO HAD LEAKED OUT OF A GAUGE ON THE TOP OF THE CONTAINER ONTO THE PAVEMENT.  THE CHASSIS TO WHICH THE TANK CONTAINER WAS ATTACHED HAD APPARENTLY BEEN HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE (A CHASSIS BEING PULLED BY A UTILITY TRACTOR) AND KNOCKED OVER.  A POLLUTION RESPONSE CONTRACTOR, ANCON ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, WAS CALLED OUT TO CLEANUP THE SPILL AND OFFLOAD THE DAMAGED TANK CONTAINER.  ANCON PROVIDED A 4,000 GALLON PLASTIC ""BAKER"" TANK FOR OFFLOADING THE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE.  HALF OF THE CARGO IN THE DAMAGED TANK CONTAINER WAS OFFLOADED TO STOP THE LEAK AND FACILITATE RIGHTING THE TANK CONTAINER.  AFTER THE CONTAINER WAS RIGHTED, REMOVED FROM THE DAMAGED CHASSIS AND PLACED ON ANOTHER CHASSIS, THE REMAINING CARGO WAS TRANSFERRRED.  THE PLAN WAS TO TRANSFER THE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE INTO ANOTHER ISO TANK CONTAINER ON FRIDAY (18TH) OR SAT (19TH) AS ONE WAS SUPPOSEDLY AVAILABLE LOCALLY.  HOWEVER, YANK MING TERMINAL HAD BEEN GIVEN ERRONEOUS INFORMATION AND IT TOOK NEARLY 4 DAYS OF INTENSIVE SEARCH TO LOCATE AN APPROPRIATE CONTAINER.  AT APPROX 2AM ON TUESDAY SEPT 22ND, FUMES/WHITE COLORED VAPORS WERE FOUND TO BE EMANATING FROM THE TOP OF THE BAKER TANK. ALL OF THE REQUISITE AGENCIES WERE NOTIFIED, THE TANK ISOLATED AND A MAJOR RESPONSE EFFORT CONTRACTOR.  CHEMTREC, AS WELL AS THE SHIPPER AND THE CONSIGNEE, WERE ALL CONTACTED FOR TECHNICAL INFORMATION. ALL RECOMMENDED THAT THE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE NOT BE TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE BAKER TANK UNTIL IT HAD COMPLETED THE OXIDATION (DECOMPOSITION) REACTIONS; NO ONE KNEW WHY THE REACTION STARTED IN THE BAKER TANK.  VARIOUS HYPOTHESES WERE OFFERED INCLUDING; PRESENCE OF AN ORGANIC CONTAMINANT IN THE BAKER TANK (HOWEVER, THE TANK HAD BEEN CERTIFIED AS CLEAN BY BAKER WHEN IT WAS RENTED BY ANCON AND DELIVERED TO THE TERMINAL); CONTAMINATION BY THE TRANSFER HOSES AND/OR PUMP USED TO OFFLOAD THE DAMAGED TANK CONTAINER (HOWEVER, THE PUMP AND HOSES WERE CLEANED PRIOR TO BEING BROUGHT TO THE TERMINAL AND NO EVIDENCE OF CONTAMINATION WAS OBSERVED IN THEM PRIOR TO TRANSFER); AND REACTION WITH/OR CONTAMINATION FROM THE AIR IN THE TANK OR WHICH ENTERED THE TANK AS IT SAT ON THE TERMINAL (2 DAYS OF THE 4 DAYS IT SAT ON THE TERMINAL INCLUDED VERY FOGGY NIGHTS AND SIGNIGICANT TEMPERATURE CHANGES).  THE LATER WAS THE CONSENSUS OF THE AGENCIES AND THE TECHNICAL EXPERTS AS THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE; CHEMICAL ANALYSES (OF THE SAMPLES TAKEN FOLLOWING THE REACTIVE PHASE) DO NOT INDICATE PRESENCE OF ANY CONTAMINANTS (SEE ENCLOSERE 3); THEREFORE, THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE ""EXOTHERMIC, OXIDATION/DECOMPOSITION REACTION"" OF THE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE INSIDE THE BAKER TANK REMAINS UNCONFIRMED.

AT THIS TIME FROM THE APPEARANCE OF THE STEAM, THE BOX APPEARED TO CONTAIN A POSSIBLE CRYOGENIC MATERIAL.  THE BOX WAS PLACED DOWN FLAT TO POSSIBLY STOP THE FLOW OF THE MATERIAL.
