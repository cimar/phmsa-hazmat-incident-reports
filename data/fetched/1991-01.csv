(AFTER THE INCIDENT, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE LIQUID WOULD NOT FLOW DUE TO ICE BLOCKING THE CONSIGNEE'S RECEIVING LINE).  THE DRIVER SHUT OFF THE PUMP.  AS HE UNHOOKED THE TANK TRUCK HOSE, PRESSURE IN THE HOSE CAUSED LIQUID CAUSTIC SODA TO SPRAY UP UNDER HIS FACE SHIELD AND BURN HIS LIPS, NOSE AND NECK.  THE DRIVER SHOULD HAVE OPENED THE DRAIN VALVE ON THE HOSE TO RELIEVE PRESSURE BEFORE DISCONNECTING THE HOSE.  THIS ACTION WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE LIQUID FROM SPRAYING. THE DRIVER WAS FULLY SUITED AT THE TIME WITH: HARD HAT, FACE SHIELD, GOGGLES, EXPOSURE JACKET AND PANTS, GLOVES AND BOOTS.

AT 3:45 A.M. ON JANUARY 31, 1991.  THE DRIVER STATED HE HAD FAILED TO TAKE STICK READINGS BEFORE HE STARTED DROPPING THE PRODUCT.  WHILE HE WAS DROPPING THE GASOLINE, THE DRIVER NOTICED GASOLINE RUNNING FROM THE PREMIUM TANK.  HE IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE VALVE ON THE TRUCK.  HE THEN CALLED AND NOTIFIED OUR LONG ISLAND CITY DISPATCH OFFICE AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00A.M.  MR. DONALD WILLIAMS, A TERMINAL SUPERVISOR, CALLED ME AT HOME AT 4:00A.M.  I TOLD HIM I WOULD CALL HIM RIGHT BACK.  I DID, AND TOLD HIM TO NOTIFY THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND ALL OTHERS ON HIS CALL LIST.  I ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 5:10 A.M. TO FIND THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT SPREADING SPEEDY DRY ON THE SPILLED PRODUCT.  THE DRIVER HAD PUT A 18"" MINI-BOOM BY THE SEWER, WHICH WAS STILL IN PLACE, TO PREVENT ANY PRODUCT FROM ENTERING THE SEWER. MR. ALAN LOEFFLER, WHO IS CHIEF OF THE TOWN OF ISLIP HARBOR POLICE, TOLD ME HE HAD ALREADY SPOKEN TO A MR. JOHN HOFMANN OF THE D.E.C., AND HE GAVE ME A SPILL NUMBER THAT MR. HOFMANN HAD GIVEN HIM (#9011460).  I THEN WENT OVER TO THE DRIVER, WHO I PREVIOUSLY TOLD TO SAY BY THE TRUCK, AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAPPENED.  MR. MALDONADO STATED HE HOOKED UP TO THE REMOTE FILLS AND STARTED TO DROP HIS PRODUCT, WITHOUT CHECKING THE STICK READINGS OR CAPS.  WHEN I ASKED HIM WHY HE SAID HE THOUGHT IT WAS A 10,000 GALLON TANK, NOT AN 8,000 AND THAT IT WOULD FIT IN THE TANK HE WAS PUTTING IT IN. HE ALSO TOLD ME THE HIGH LEVEL ALARM NEVER SOUNDED.  I CHECKED THE TRUCK AND THE DRIVER HAD 1,450 GALLONS OF PRODUCT IN ONE COMPARTMENT AND 550 GALLONS IN THE 2,300 GALLON COMPARTMENT.  HE WAS SUPPOSE TO DELIVER 3,200 GALLONS OF PLUS, 3,750 GALLONS ON UNLEADED REGULAR, AND 5,050 GALLONS OF PREMIUM.  WHEN I CHECKED THE STATIONS INVENTORY FROM THE PREVIOUS MORNINGS, I FOUND THE PLUS GALLONAGE CHECKED OUT WITH 3,200 GALLONS DELIVERED AND SO DID THE 5,050 GALLONS OF UNLEADED REGULAR.  I THEN STUCK FOR WATER, BUT ALL TANKS HAD LESS THAN A HALF INCH OF WATER,  THE PREVIOUS DAYS (1/30/91) INVENTORY SHOWED THE PRODUCT IN THE PREMIUM TANK TO BE 5,694 GALLONS (62""), LESS 181 GALLONS OF GAS PUMPED FOR THE DAY (1/30/91), PLUS 1,750 GALLONS DELIVERED, COMES TO A BALANCE OF 7,263 GALLONS OF INVENTORY.  THE TOTAL CAPACITY OF THIS TANK IS 7,829 GALLONS OF PRODUCT. I FEEL THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THIS SPILL IS MORE THAN ONE.  FIRST, THE STATION HAD GIVEN THE DISPATCH OFFICE INCORRECT STICK READINGS.  SECOND, THE DRIVER FAILED TO STICK THE TANKS BEFORE DROPPING THE PRODUCT.  THIRD, IF HE HAD STUCK THE TANKS HE WOULD HAVE SEEN NO COVERS WERE ON THE PREMIUM OR UNLEADED REGULAR TANKS.  TO CORRECT THE SITUATION I INSTRUCTED MY DRIVERS THAT, AS ALWAYS, THE DRIVERS ARE RESPONSIBLE TO STICK THE TANKS AND INSURE THE COVERS ARE ON BEFORE DROPPING THE PRODUCT.
