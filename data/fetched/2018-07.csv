The trip is one that the driver made frequently, and the roads he was traveling on were familiar.  The driver is an experienced bulk truck operator, who has been with Austin Powder Company for about two years. The truck was loaded with about 24,000 pounds of bulk oxidizer-3 bins of ammonium nitrate prill, and 1 DOT spec tank filled with ammonium nitrate emulsion.  The truck also had a bulk quantity of combustible liquid, NOS (fuel oil) and a non-bulk quantity of acetic acid.  The road the truck was traveling on (Texas FM 1200) is 2 lanes, running north and south across ranch land. The road climbs slightly at this point, and is straight.  Around 12:05 CST, only two minutes into the trip, as the driver was traveling roughly 58 MPH, the passenger side tires on the vehicle went off the pavement onto a grassy area.   The grass was soggy because of recent rains.  The truck veered off the road for over 200 feet, going nearly 8 feet off the roadway at one point.  The driver attempted to bring the truck back to the roadway, and succeeded in getting both of the steer tires back on the pavement.  However, the weight of the truck had already shifted to the passenger side, and steering back to the left only made the situation worse.  Around 260 feet, the truck began to roll onto its passenger side.  It rolled a complete completely over (360 degrees) and came to rest on its tires completely off the road in a grassy area next to a fence.  It was during this roll that the product leaked out of the ammonium nitrate bins on the vehicle.  A total of between 400 to 500 pounds of ammonium nitrate prill leaked.  Nothing on the bin failed.  Rather the material simply spilled out as the vehicle rolled.  The driver extricated himself from the vehicle, and initiated Austin's emergency response procedures, calling 911, CHEMTREC, and APC personnel.  The driver received superficial bruises, and refused treatment at the scene.  A cleanup crew was dispatched to the scene, and spent roughly 3 hours vacuuming up the spilled product and putting it in 5 drums.  The road was not closed at any time after the accident, or during the cleanup phase.  The crew finished their work and a dig of the impacted area was scheduled for a later date.  During the subsequent interviewing of the driver, he reported seeing ""a coyote or a small dog"" which caused him to leave the roadway in an effort to avoid hitting the animal.","The driver is re-doing a large portion of his on-the-job training, and completing an online training module prior to getting back to a truck on his own. He has been counseled on safe practices for encountering animals while driving.  Austin is partnering with a  national truck driving school in developing a program for refresher training, which will include rollover prevention.

A courtesy report was placed to Anne of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, who elected to not generate a state report number, as the amount released was below the reportable quantity.","Generator was notified of the release and the driver was retrained on more thorough container inspection, with an emphasis on container integrity, seams, and chimes.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"CLEAN HARBORS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.",US,

While conducting the pre-trip load inspection, the driver discovered liquid dripping out of the front end of the roll-off container. Driver called the internal Emergency Operations Center to alert of the in-transit release. At this point, the customer was also notified of the spill, and used their own in-house emergency response team to clean up the spill.   A roll-off container trailer operated by Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc. was in route from the shipper’s location to the designated Clean Harbors disposal facility. During the course of the trip, the driver conducted a routine load check and discovered a small amount of material coming from the roll-off container. The driver immediately placed a containment pail under the rear door and contacted his home dispatcher to request a response crew. Upon notification, a response crew was summoned, donned the appropriate personal protective equipment, removed the released material","Investigation of the spill determined the root cause to be the fact that the customer overfilled the roll-off bin. As a result, the customer was counseled and the following suggestions rendered: Load less than ¾ full with this type of material; If box will be sitting more than 2-3 days, add sand or dirt on top of material to act as absorbent in the event of settling or sweating; and, Continue to open tarps and control roll off prior to shipping.

The GATX 79720 had been identified by ODOT Hazmat Inspector (Ray Hubbell) during a yard inspection as leaking at a rate of approximately 1 gallon per minute from the top of the car.  The Portland Fire Department responded who initiated a road closure on Hwy 30 and instituted a 1/4 mile evacuation of local businesses.  PFD indicated to BNSF that 6 business had employees evacuated and estimated the number evacuated to be approximately 200.  There were no injuries or reported exposures.  BNSF Hazmat responders and contractors responded to the incident.  Upon inspection, the car was found to have an open liquid line valve.  In addition, the male camlock fitting on top of the valve was found to be less than hand tight allowing liquid toluene to lead from the fitting.  Responders were able to close the valve thus stopping the release.  The threaded camlock fitting was removed to have new thread sealant applied.  It was then reapplied to a tool tight condition.  Air monitoring was continuous to monitor for LEL and toxicity via the PID sensor.     Responders on-site estimate that approximately 150 gallons of Toluene was released as a result of the incident.  Most of this liquid quickly evaporated from the car body but some impacts were noted to the ballast immediately underneath the car.  BNSF's environmental contractor obtained soil samples on 7/6/18 from the area under the car to determine toluene concentrations remaining in the soil and to develop a remediation plan.  The times reported and release volumes reported are estimates only and as recieved by different groups in the field.",Tauber Oil Company has been notified of the condition.

The car was isolated and the consignee, Fleischmanns Vinegar was the party that reported the incident. Marion Enviromental (MEI), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found liquid product to be coming out of the pressure relief valve and liquid product to be coming out of the vapor line valve. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the consignee Jim Pearson at 334-590-1407. Contractor personnel assisted personnel from Fleischmanns Vinegar with offloading product from the car to secure the release.  MEI and Fleischmanns offloaded a portion of the car into drums securing the release.  A special move from CSXT personnel moved the car to the loading rack at the consignee location and Fleischmanns offloaded the car without further incident.  Upon inspection the car revealed 0 inches of outage and was found to be overloaded.  This car was located on a storage track just outside of the consignee facility and was constructively placed on 07/04/18.

For this offload, a site employee asked for assistance because they were short handed due to vacations, family emergencies and an employee that gave their notice.  The driver volunteered to assist in the offload.  It was the site EE that removed the nuts on the blind flange and there was a small amount of 70% HF that leaked into the containment.  According to the employee the leak was small and contained within the unloading area.  It was allowed to drip to the ground and diluted with water.","Upon return of cargo tank, the 2” valve at the end of the unloading hose was removed and tested by Reliability.  It was tested at 25psi and 55 psi and no breakthrough was observed. No other visual defects were noted when the valve was inspected by Reliability.  Corrective Actions: Test the valve. Replace the hoses with new stainless steel hoses.  Update the unloading SOP to include a walk down of the hose.  Educate all fleet drivers about the incident at next safety meeting.

The car was isolated and shipper, National Response Center, and Ohio EPA were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2018-0731-00222). SUNPRO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a release of less than one gallon of lading from the pressure relief device flange (there was no evidence of PRD lift). The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Ms. Jeanne Kochevar, phone 440-007-6862. Contractor personnel cleaned all visible product from the top of the car, and the car was owner was notified to have a Mobile Repair Unit respond to remove and replace the PRD flange gasket. The leak was secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move.

The FA called the cockpit to report that Passenger Eric Cox had just disclosed that he had some lithium batteries in his valet bag. He had 8 all together, 6 for his drone and 2 e-cigs each the size of a number 2 pencil. Upon hearing Mr. COX report to the FA that he had lithium batteries in his bag, Mr. Nels Long and Mr. Wing KO JR also wanted to report that they also had batteries in their valet bags. It appears that each of these passengers had removed their lithium batteries from their checked bags and placed them in their carry on bags. They were then gate checked at the gate as valet bags. They were provided with an opportunity to remove and liquids, gels, lap tops or anything with lithium batteries or medications along with anything flammable. They left their bags at the end of the jetbridge to be loaded, but said nothing regarding the lithium batteries until they were in line for take off. This caused the flight to return to gate, the ramp had just closed due to lightening. When the A/C parked and the ramp opened, we had these passengers make a positive I.D. of their valet bags and the lithium batteries were removed and were rendered safe for transport, then taken on board with each corresponding passenger.

The vehicle involved was a tractor tanker-trailer (Haul of Fame Transport Units TT31 & 9633), with the tanker-trailer containing approximately 9000 gallons of automotive gasoline (HM Class 3, UN #1203). Due to the nature of the crash, the vehicle came to rest on its right side with the tractor’s right-side saddle diesel tank (approx. 100 gallons total capacity) leaking fuel through the fill neck. The diesel fuel (HM Class 3, 1993) spill occurred in the amount of approximately 20-50 gallons and primarily affected the roadway and the grass shoulder and ditch of the southeast quadrant of LA 1026 (Juban Road) and Crossing Way. Haul of Fame Transport, LLC driver, Anthony Reis, called 911 and then notified Haul of Fame Transport President, Boyd Leahy of the crash. Louisiana State Police (LSP), Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LADEQ), Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office (LPSO) and Livingston Parish Fire Department (LPFD) all responded to the scene. OMI Environmental Solutions, LLC 131 Keating Drive Belle Chase, LA 70037 (Ph. 800-645-6671) was contacted as the spill mitigation contractor for clean-up of the scene. Livingston Parish Sheriff’s Office investigated the crash and their investigation revealed that the tractor-trailer was northbound on Juban Road and turned east onto Crossing Way headed to a nearby gas station to deliver fuel when the right-side trailer tires trailed off the roadway and onto the low right side shoulder. The driver stated that in addition to the darkness of the intersection, he was unable to see that the right-side shoulder was low due to tall grass. As the vehicle negotiated the turn, the right-side trailer tires dropped off the right-side edge and with a full load of fuel, the trailer rolled onto its right side. The fifth-wheel connection held, the tractor rolled with the trailer and the tractor-trailer came to rest on its right side on the shoulder of the road. Due to the tractor resting on its right side, the right-side saddle tank, which was full of diesel fuel, leaked from the filler neck cap. The vehicle was equipped with spill mitigation material however, due to the location of the spill being under the overturned vehicle the driver was unable to deploy the material safely. Due to the tanker-trailer containing approximately 9,000 gallons of gasoline, LSP and LPSO closed LA Hwy 1026 (Juban Road) to all traffic both northbound and southbound while the diesel spill was mitigated with sand, socks and mats and the tanker’s contents was removed via pump and hose to another tanker. No fire nor injury resulted from the crash. The tractor and trailer were righted and then removed from the scene by Trading Post Wrecker Service, Denham Springs, LA. The roadway was re-opened at","Corrective actions include the following.  1. The driver involved received remedial training for rollover prevention. Specifically, the FMCSA Cargo Tank Rollover Prevention Training videos were utilized.  The driver completed a written quiz following the presentation to confirm the retention of information.  2. The implementation of a company wide Accident Countermeasures Program to track and institute procedures to prevent crashes. 3. All driver's are to complete the FMCSA Cargo Tank Rollover Prevention Training along with several defensive driving courses targeted to address the following dangerous driving situations; Cornering, Night Driving, Backing, Emergency Maneuvers, Extreme Conditions, Skid Control and General Defensive Driving.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,100000,Tiger Fuel Inc.,US,

The shipment contained DG and the proper paper work was completed for  the shipment including the shipper's declaration and Notification to the Pilot in Command (NOPIC).  Once the shipment was loaded the and the jet bridge was detached from the aircraft, the Load Master (LM) realized that he had forgotten to provide the pilot with the NOPIC. The LM called the pilot to inform him that the NOPIC needed to be signed. The pilot declined to have the jet bridge reattached and asked the LM to provide the information over the radio and send a copy of the NOPIC to dispatch. The flight departed at approximately 1015.  Root Cause of the incident was that the Company's policy on the acceptance and handling of dangerous goods was not properly followed.  It is the policy in the Flight Ops Manual 16.2.2 (G) of Hawaiian Airlines that for any Hazmat loaded on the aircraft, the Captain will be notified of the article by a NOPIC and the NOPIC must be on the flight deck whenever there is Hazmat on the aircraft. Per CFR 173.33(11)(b),  a copy of the NOPIC needs to be maintained on board during the transport of hazard material aboard the aircraft.  According to 49 CFR 175.33 - Shipping paper and notification of pilot-in-command: The NOPIC document (HAL 902) must be presented to the PIC for signature and carried onboard the aircraft for the duration of the flight. HA Passenger Service Manual Section 10.0 also states that the completed NOPIC must be presented to the PIC once the hazmat has been loaded. There was no failure of the package.",The PIC was counseled by the Chief Pilot and Flight OPs has reviewed training to ensure that  continuous qualification ground school courses provide adequate training for DG awareness.     Station Chief for the flight and all agents received a Letter of Counseling for not being aware of the regulations and  HA policies. All applicable personal at the SAN station were re-briefed on the NOPIC requirements and  procedures and company policies and requirements were reviewed with all responsible personnel.,No,DRUM METAL,"Metal pail, open head, capacity 10 gallons or less",PAIL MTL,No,Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC.",US,

Driver advised that he connected the hoses and fittings in preparation for unloading. The facility began the unloading process by pumping the load from the tanker. Approximately 30 minutes into the unloading process the tanker failed and caused a release of product from the side of the tanker. Investigation indicates that one of the primary contributing factors to the tank failure is that the vapor recovery valve was closed which led to a vacuum being created during the process of pumping the load from the tanker. Secondary to this would be that the vacuum relief valve did not engage properly to relieve vacuum from the tanker.

At approximately 1505 hours the truck was done loading. The IMTT Operators started blowing back the product line. to the truck. One of the IMTT Operators noticed there was a slight drip coming from the gasket at the flange on the trailer. The two IMTT Operators notified their supervisor and attempted to get the loading tube to stop leaking at the flange. Once they determined that the internal valve would not hold, the IMTT Supervisor notified the IMTT Chemical Operations Manager to come to the loading rack to evaluate the situation. The IMTT Chemical Operations Manager for US Ecology(IMTT's OSRO) to trans load from All Chem trailer to a US Ecology Vacuum truck. It was noted there is a 4"" cap with a valve on the trailer opposite side of the loading valve. The IMTT Chemical Operations Supervisor and the US Ecology Foreman were getting ready to transfer the load from the truck trailer. When they released the cap on the truck there was a tremendous amount of pressure which released approximately. 40-50 gallons of methanol into the surrounding scale containment at the loading rack. IMTT's Emergency Response Team immediately released foam to suppress the methanol release. Once the release was contained US Ecology continued with trans load. The balance of the methanol was then transferred from the US Ecology truck to another All Chem trailer.",Upon further inspection it was discovered that an obstruction was lodged inside the trailers internal valve that prevented proper closure. IMTT contacted the customer of the product being loaded to report the incident. Any costs incurred for the cleanup response and repairs to the trailer be handled by the customer and the transportation company.,No,,,,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,25000,IMTT,US,

It became apparent that the containers inside were leaking when the box started showing signs of being wet. The box was immediately put inside a salvage drum. There was no liquid spilled on any other boxes or property and it must of spilled about a cups worth of liquid inside the box. Note this hazmat is a solid mixture I don't know it spilled at all, but I have pictures. Upon further inspection of the box I noticed one cap was missing form one container most likely caused by the fall, I could not find the cap. The caps on two other containers were loose and had visible signs of liquid seeping out the tops. The outer box has visible signs of damage where the product ate away at the box. Full safety gear was used to segregate and store the damaged hazmat till it was put inside the drum. The package is currently inside a salvage drum inside the hazmat cage where it awaits a disposition from PGH for disposal.

THE INCIDENT OCCURRED DURING THE UNLOADING PROCESS AT OUR FACILITY. WE RECEIVE THE MATERIAL AS CHROMIC FLAKES FROM ELEMENTIS AND THEN ADD WATER DIRECTLY TO THE RAILCAR TO MAKE IT A 60% CHROMIN ACID SOLUTION THAT WE USE IN ONE OF OUR PROCESSES. THE EMPLOYEE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF ATTACHING A HOSE TO THE DISCHARGE FLANGE TO UNLOAD THE 60% CHROMIC ACID SOLUTION TO THE CHROMIC ACID STORAGE TANK. WHEN HE REMOVED THE CAP, THE MATERIAL SPRAYED OUT THE BOTTOM VALVE SPRAYING THE EMPLOYEE WITH 60% CHROMIC ACID. TWO EMPLOYEES ATTEMPTED TO OPERATE THE VALAVE TO STOP THE SPRAYING, HOWEVER THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL IN STOPPING THE SPRAY AFTER CYCLING THE VALVE A NUMBER OF TIMES. WE MONITORED THE SPILL FOR A PERIOD OF THREE HOURS AS 9,608 GALLONS OF 60% CHROMIC ACID SOLUTION WENT TO CONTAINMENT. WE WERE ABLE TO PUMP THE MATERIAL TO TWO PROCESS WATER TANKS IN THE TANK FARM TO REUSE. AFTER THE RAILCAR WAS EMPTIED WE INVESTIGATED TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE VALVE NOT OPERATING. WE FOUND THAT THE REACH ROD WAS NOT CONNECTED TO THE BOTTOM DISCHARGE VALVE. WE ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE INJURED EMPLOYEE NEVER UNPINNED THE VALVE AND THE VALVE WAS IN THE CLOSED-PINNED POSITION AS IT ARRIVED FROM THE VENDOR. THIS WAS ALSO VERIFIED WITH THE TWO EMPLOYEES WHO ATTEMPTED TO OPERATE THE VALVE; THE VALVE ARRIVED IN THE PINNED CLOSED POSITION, ROD WAS DISENGAGED FROM VALVE, AND THE VALVE WAS DETERMINED TO BE PARTIALLY OPENED ALLOWING MATERIAL TO PASS THROUGH. THE RAILCARS THAT DELIVER CHROMIUM TRIOXIDE TO THE SITE HAVE TWO COMPARTMENTS. THE FIRST COMPARTMENT HAD ALREADY BEEN UNLOADED EARLIER WITH NO ISSUES-THIS ROD HAD A MECHANICAL STOP THAT PREVENTED THE ROD FROM BECOMING DISENGAGED FROM THE VALVE. THE SECOND COMPARTMENT DID NOT HAVE A MECHANICAL STOP THUS ALLOWING THE ROD TO BECOME DISENGAGED FROM THE BOTTOM VALVE.",WE CONTACTED OUR VENDOR AND DISCUSSED WITH THEM THE ISSUES WE FOUND WITH THE RAILCAR AND RESULTED IN THE INJURY AND RELEASE OF MATERIAL. THEY DID COME ON-SITE TO INVESTIGATE AND DETERMINE THEY NEEDED TO REPLACE THE VALVE BEFORE SHIPPING BACK TO THEIR FACILITY. THEY SENT A LICENSED CONTRACTOR TO REPAIR THE VALAVE A COUPLE OF DAYS FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT AND WE WERE ABLE TO SEND THE RAILCAR BACK TO ELEMENTS. THEY ASSURED US THAT THEY DO PRE AND POST INSPECTIONS ON ALL OF THEIR RAILCARS AND IT IS THEIR INTENTION THAT THE VALVE IS CLOSED BEFORE BEING SHIPPED OUT.

The fuel had been contained to the storm drain. The road way had an area approximately 20 feet by 40 feet that was impacted. There was also a long narrow trail leading back to the initial release location. Mr. Girard inspected two(2) storm drains which could not be opened to check for gasoline. One drain had a gallon or so of gasoline inside it. The only collection point was the outfall of the storm drain. The team placed absorbent boom and the fire department flushed the drain with 1500 gallons of water. The team collected 2,500 gallons of water. Very little gasoline was on the water. The team generated two(2) 55 gallon drums of spent absorbents from cleaning the impacted roadway. ODEQ was still concerned that the fuel did not make it completely out of the storm drain system. Mr. Girard suggested a team return in the morning and enter the large concrete culvert and utilize absorbent boom to collect and draw any remaining fuel out. Mr. Lance Pennington of ODEQ agreed with the plan. Monday- July 16,2018 The following morning the team returned and implemented the plan. Very little fuel was located in the back of the culvert. This was drawn out with boom and soaked up by absorbent pads. The team replaced the existing boom and pads and left them in place to be picked up at a later date. The team generated two(2) bags of spent absorbents.

The driver took his eyes oil the road momentarily and the truck's passenger side tires left the pavement. The roadway had no shoulder and a steep embankment existed. The driver attempted to correct the truck back on the roadway, but was unable to do so causing the transport to roll onto it's side. The cargo tank trailer was carrying 7000 gallons of diesel fuel which began slowly leaking from the manway hatches of the compartments and vent as a result of the accident. Approximately 150 gallons of fuel leaked out of the cargo tank over roughly a three hour period. Emergency responders were able to capture much of the leaking fuel by means of a tarp. The fuel remaining in the wrecked cargo tank was successfully transferred to another truck. The wrecked truck and trailer were then uprighted and towed away from the scene. An Environmental Contractor excavated a small area where fuel had impacted soil, and then backfilled and reseeded.

The IMTT Chemical Operator contacted his supervisor who reported to the area. The IMTT Chemical Operator and Supervisor conducted an investigation and found the leak coming from a small hole in the body of the trailer. The IMTT Chemical Operator placed a pan under the drip and added Neutralizer to the pan to mitigate the odor.",IMTT contacted the customer of the product (Butyl Acrylate) who requested that contents of the trailer be pumped back into the original above ground storage tank. After the transfer was complete the IMTT Chemical Supervisor checked inside of the trailer to make sure there was no residual remaining.

Upon further investigation it was noticed that the product(methanol) was all the way up to the top of the.fitting on the 3"" induction tube and the vapor line was closed with pressure still on the line. The IMTT Chemical Supervisor started to relieve the pressure on the vapor line and at that point the product started to go down the induction tube.",Upon investigation it was determined that the IMTT Chemical Operator failed to relieve the pressure in the hose before disconnecting the rail car.

WHEN I GOT TO LOAD ARM 7, WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO COMPARTMENT 1 (WHICH HAS A 3500 GALLON CAPACITY) I REALIZED IT HAD BEEN DEACTIVATED, SO I DID NOT SELECT, OR ENTER A LOAD AMOUNT INTO THE CARD READER TO LOAD NUMBER 7.

I DECIDED TO USE THE STOP PROCEDURE ON THE CARD READER IN AN ATTEMPT TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW OF FUEL SO I COULD DETACH LOAD ARM 6 AND THEN ARM 7 TO CORRECT THIS.
