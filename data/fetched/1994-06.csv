THE DRIVER THEN TURNED AND WALKED TOWARD HIS TRUCK TO UNLOAD THE UNLEADED.  AS HE WAS PULLING OUT THE TRUCK DELIVERY HOSES HE TURNED TOWARD THE FILL AREA AND NOTICED THE SUPER FITTING HAD BECOME UNHOOKED AND GASOLINE WAS RUNNING OUT ONTO THE GROUND.  THE DRIVER THEN SHUTT OFF THE FLOW OF PRODUCT FROM HIS TRAILER TO THE SUPER TANK, ASKED STATION MANAGER TO NOTIFY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND STARTED TO CONTAIN THE SPILL OF GASOLINE WITH OUR COMPANY SPILL KIT.

A DRIP WAS DISCOVERED ORIGINATING FROM THE END GATE OF A LOADED TRAILER ON CLEAN-UP'S YARD.  THIS LOAD ORIGINATED IN SAVANNAH, GA AND WAS IN ROUTE TO HASKELL, OK.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE INSIDE OF THE TRAILER WAS FOUND TO HAVE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF OILY LIQUID INSIDE THE TRAILER.  A TRACK HOE HAD TO BE USED TO MOVE MATERIAL AWAY FROM THE END GATE SO THAT FLY ASH AND OIL DRY COULD BE PLACED TO ABSORB THE LIQUID. APPROXIMATELY 6 OZ. OF LIQUID HAD ESCAPED THE TRAILER.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF SOIL FROM THE SPILL AREA WAS REMOVED AND PLACED INSIDE THE TRAILER WITH THE LOAD REMOVING ALL CONTAMINATION FROM THE GROUND.  THERE WAS NO OTHER CONTAMINATION OR THREAT TO OTHERS OR THE ENVIRONMENT.  NO MATERIAL WAS SPILLED NEAR ANY WATER WAY.  BECAUSE OF THIS DISCOVERY, I ORDERED AN INSPECTION OF OTHER LOADED TRAILERS, SOME FROM THE SAME LOCATION ON OUR YARD AWAITING DISPATCH.  THE INSPECTION REVEALED TWO OTHER TRAILERS WITH EXCESSIVE LIQUIDS IN THE LOAD.  THESE TRAILERS HAD NOT LEAKED.  THE TRACK HOE WAS AGAIN USED TO MOVE MATERIAL AWAY FROM THE END GATE IN ORDER TO PLACE FLY ASH AT THIS LOCATION TO PREVENT A LEAK FROM THE TRAILER. ALTHOUGH OUR TRAILERS, END GATES ARE EQUIPPED WITH RUBBER A GASKET, THESE TRAILERS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO CARRY FREE LIQUIDS.  MATERIAL MUST BE DRY OR VIBRATION DURING TRANSPORT WILL CAUSE LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS TO SEPARATE. EACH TRAILER WAS DELIVERED TO IT'S FINAL DESTINATION, CHIEF SUPPLY WITHOUT INCIDENT.

THE ACCIDENT OCCURED AS THE TRUCK WAS ENTERING THE ENTRANCE RAMP.  AT THE TIME THE ACCIDENT OCCURED, IT WAS RAINING.  THE DRIVER DOWNSHIFTED, HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE DID NOT RESPOND TO HIS STEERING EFFORTS AS HE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THE RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE ENTRANCE RAMP.  THE TRUCK SLID ON THE MIXTURE OF RAIN WATER AND OIL ON THE ROADWAY UNTIL THE FRONT WHEELS WERE COMPLETELY OFF THE ROADWAY.  WHEN THE TRUCK REACHED THE GRASS, IT REGAINED TRACTION AND BEGAN TO TURN TO THE RIGHT.  THE TRUCK CONTINUED APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET ON THE GRASS (PARALLEL TO THE ROADWAY), ON AN INCLINE.  THE VEHICLE THEN ROLLED OVER ON ITS SIDE, BECAUSE OF THE INCLINE.  THE ROOF OF THE TRUCK BECAME DETACHED AND APPROXIMATELY HALF THE CONTENTS OF THE TRUCK (80 MANIFESTED PIECES FROM AMERICAN STEEL FOUNDRIES AND ASSORTED SUPPLIES) WERE THROWN FROM THE VEHICLE.  THE INDIANA STATE POLICE AND THE HAMMOND INDIANA POLICE ARRIVED ON SITE TO SECURE THE AREA.  THE POLICE SUMMONED THE HAMMOND FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE HAZMAT RESPONSE TEAM AND OLDENBERG & SON, INC TOWING COMPANY.  THE DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION DELIVERED SAND TO BLOCK THE RUNOFF OF RAINWATER FROM THE SITE.  THE DRIVER CONTACTED THE APPROPRIATE CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL.  THE INITIAL CWM RESPONSE TEAM ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 7:00 PM AND THE ENTIRE TEAM WAS AT THE SITE BY 7:30 PM.  THE HAMMOND FIRE DEPARTMENT PULLED SAMPLES OF THE RUNOFF OF RAINWATER.  THE CWM RESPONSE TEAM PROCEEDED TO UPRIGHT AND INSPECT ALL OF THE CONTAINERS AND REMOVE THE REMAINING CONTAINERS FROM THE TRUCK.  DURING THIS INSPECTION, THE TEAM DISCOVERED 2 OPEN AND 5 LEAKING DRUMS.  ALL OF THE SPILLED OR LEAKED MATERIAL WAS ON THE ROADWAY OR IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. NO SPILL/LEAK MATERIALS REACHED THE SOIL.  THE TWO OPEN CONTAINERS CONTAINED LAB PACKS.  THE INVENTORIES WERE MATCHED TO THE DRUM CONTENTS AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO MATERIALS HAD BEEN RELEASED.  THE LIDS WERE PLACED BACK ON THESE DRUMS, AND SEALED PROPERLY.  THE FIVE LEAKING DRUMS CONTAINED PAINT-RELATED MATERIAL (ONE CONTAINED LATEX PAINT NOT SUBJECT TO THE HAZMAT REGULATIONS, FOUR CONTAINED CLASS 3 SOLVENT BASED PAINT WITH A HAZARDOUS WASTE CODE OF D001).  APPROXIMATELY ONE GALLON OF THE LATEX PAINT MATERIAL WAS RELEASED.  A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 3 GALLONS (30 POUNDS) OF THE SOLVENT BASED PAINT MATERIAL WAS RELEASED.  THE RQ FOR D001 WASTE MATERIAL IS 100 POUNDS, SO THERE WAS NO RQ AMOUNT RELEASED.  THE FIVE LEAKING CONTAINERS AND THE CLEANUP MATERIALS USED TO ABSORB THE SPILLED MATERIAL WERE OVERPACKED INTO 16 GALLON DRUMS.  THE MANIFESTS WERE CORRECTED TO SHOW THE CHANGE IN DRUM SIZES.  ONE FIBER DRUM (WHICH CONTAINED WASTE BROMINE) BECAME SOAKED FROM THE RAIN, AND WAS OVERPACKED INTO A 16 GALLON DRUM.  NO MATERIAL WAS RELEASED FROM THIS DRUM.

DOBSON DISCOVERED A DRIP ORIGINATING FROM THE END GATE OF THE TRAILER HE WAS HOOKING UP TO DELIVER.  APPROXIMATELY TWO GALLONS OF MATERIAL HAD LEAKED FROM THE TRAILER ONTO THE GROUND.  NO MATERIAL WAS SPILLED INTO ANY WATERWAY.  MR. DOBSON FOLLOWED PROCEDURES IN HIS ""DRIVERS DISCHARGE SHEET"" AND CALLED IN AS REQUIRED.  I ADVISED HIM TO PLACE PLASTIC AND OIL DRY ON THE GROUN AND TO TRY AND TIGHTEN THE TURNBUCKLES WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE SEAL BETWEEN THE END GATE AND TRAILER TO STOP THE LEAK.  HE DID THIS AND WAS SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING ANY MORE MATERIAL FROM ESCAPING THE TRAILER.  MR. DOBSON REMOVED THE CONTAMINATED GRAVEL, PLASTIC SHEETING AND OIL DRY AND PLACED IT INSIDE THE TRAILER WITH THE LOAD.  ALL CONTAMINATION WAS REMOVED.  I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED CHIEF SUPPLY OF THE SITUATION AND INQUIRED AS TO THE (RQ) OF ONE POUND (1 LB.), I MADE THE NECESSARY NOTIFICATIONS TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND TO LOUISIANA HAMZAT UNIT.  I MADE THE REQUIRED NOTIFICATION TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 1839 HOURS FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT.
