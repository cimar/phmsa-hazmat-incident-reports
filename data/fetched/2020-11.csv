Upon inspection it was determined that there was a small crack in the plastic carboy at the top of the container. The carboy was placed in a 30 Gallon fiber drum with a bag and spill pads in it. The bag was not sealed. During handling and transport, the container may have been further compromised while using a forklift to load the containers onto an outgoing vehicle on 11/5/2020.  Upon arrival at the destination location in Middlesex, NJ on 11/5/2020, the fiber drum was visibly wet with liquid and had a bad odor. No free liquids were observed in the vehicle. It is estimated that a small amount of less than a pint of liquid leaked out of the crack of the carboy and into the 30 gallon fiber drum and was absorbed by the cardboard of the drum. The fiber drum was further over-packed into a plastic drum at the Veolia, Middlesex, NJ destination location to prevent it from leaking.  On 11/6/2020 the Veolia safety manager investigated what occurred at the Schenectady, NY transportation terminal. It was discovered that employees who were told originally about the crack in the 5 gallon carboy had discussed what they thought was the best way to overpack the leaking carboy. Instead of using an appropriate plastic overpack container, they decided to use a fiber drum and use a plastic bag and some spill pads to try and assure that the 5-gallon carboy would not leak.","As part of the followup investigation on 11/6/20, it was determined that the manager of the Veolia, Schenectady, NY facility will be notified of any leaking containers in the future and will review with employees the best method to overpack a leaking container or to prevent any further leaking of containers. This will be a new standard operating procedure at the Veolia, Schenectady, NY location.  Additionally all Veolia employees in the New England district will be trained on spill prevention and review the incident that occurred.  In the future, any containers of liquid that appear to be leaking will be prohibited from being packaged in a fiber container.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The car was isolated and the shipper, IFF Chemical Holdings, was notified via CHEMTREC Report #2020-1109-00139.  Marion Environmental, Inc. (MEI), a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found a vapor release from the car’s manway cover.  The manway cover was not properly aligned due to an out of adjustment safety collar on one of the cover’s bolts.   Additionally, MEI noted damage to the suspect cover bolt’s safety collar that appeared to be due to tightening the manway cover nut with the safety collar out of adjustment.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper’s representative: Luke Moore (706-799-7885).  Contractor personnel adjusted the safety collar and secured the manway cover to stop the vapor release. The car was held at the CSX Brunswick, MD yard pending receipt of a One Time Movement Approval from the FRA for movement to home shop for repair of the defective manway cover bolt/safety collar.","(NAR code:204 5 What Failed: Manway, Hinged & Bolted Where Failed: Connection between manway nozzle and manway cover Why Failed: Bolt(s) broken, old break with threads/nut missing and/or rusted)",No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2000,CSX CORPORATION,US,

Veolia employees were outside of the vehicle on a break when they noticed about 100 ml of the sodium hydroxide solution on the ground in a store parking lot in Franklin, MA. Once the Veolia employees noticed the spill outside of the vehicle they went into the back of the vehicle to investigate. The container that was leaking was a 40 gallon open-top poly drum with a poly bladder inside. At the bottom of the container has an opening where the bladder hose would normally come through. The hose on the bladder was clamped and the bottom opening and lid were taped. These containers have been shipped in the past but they contained non-DOT regulated material. The Veolia employees cleaned up the spill and over-packed the container to prevent further release.   The release of material most likely came from a small hole in the inner bladder. The Veolia employees could tell that the hose was not leaking. The material that leaked from the bladder then came out through the opening at the bottom of the poly drum. Hazardous materials should not have been shipped in this type of container because it was not rated to do so. Before accepting for transportation the sodium hydroxide solution should have been transferred into the proper UN specification package or overpacked into a container that had the proper UN rating. The Veolia employees who accepted this container for transportation are knowledgeable of the requirements for transporting hazardous materials.","To prevent this from occurring again, this incident will be shared with all districts throughout Veolia, at a nationwide level.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Kinder Morgan was notified directly via phone . Conrail Manager of  Hazardous Material, Joe Caccamo along with Marion Environmental personnel, investigated the leak and found  the source to appear to be above the valve at the flange of the tank car. The leak was unable to be stopped so  a spill containment pan was placed beneath the valve to catch the dripping product. The tank car was then  placed on the wye track where it could be further inspected and made safe. Adam Kelly, Operations Supervisor  for Kinder Morgan 267-885-5481 arrived to inspect the tank car. It was decided that the safest course of action would be to  clean and purge the tank car and obtain One Time Movement Approval for home shop repairs. The tank car was  clean and purged, placards were removed, the faulty valve was tagged, and the tank car was labeled for home  shop repair ""do not load"". It is awaiting final waybill updates to be placed back into transportation to home shop.

As a result, approximately 3,000 gallons of UN3264, Corrosive liquid, acidic, inorganic, nos, 8, PGIII ""Phosphorous Acid"" released impacting the asphalt roadway and soil alongside the roadway. No drains or waterways were reported impacted by this release. Haz Mat Special Services LLC out of San Antonio, TX was dispatched to perform emergency response and cleanup operations. At 2215 ET, Haz Mat Special Services LLC personnel arrived onsite and reported that approximately 3,000 gallons of UN3264, Corrosive liquid, acidic, inorganic, nos, 8, PGIII ""Phosphorous Acid"" had released from (13) 275 - gallon poly totes impacting all four lanes of the highway stretching out 150 yards as well as a 30' by 80' area of soil alongside the highway. The contractor began performing tote transfers to recover the product remaining in the totes. Three (3) new 275 - gallon totes were filled with the remaining product in the 13 totes, approximately 600 gallons total. The damaged totes were placed into one (1) roll off box to be transported offsite. Granular absorbents and neutralizer were applied to the impacted area of the asphalt roadway to absorb, solidify and neutralize the free - standing product. Haz Mat Special Services LLC personnel collected the spent absorbents into one (1) additional roll off box which was transported offsite. The impacted area of soil was secured with poly sheeting until further remediation could be coordinated. On 11/12/2020, Haz Mat Special Services LLC personnel returned to the site and applied a sodium bicarbonate solution to the area of impacted soil and gravel. pH tests were conducted confirming neutrality.

Right passenger tires left pavement onto soft embankment (no shoulder) into a ditch.  The truck traveled approximately 100 yards traversing a culvert which broke the hose reel and piping on the rear deck of the truck.  The truck ended up on its right side.  The driver made sure that the the belly valve was closed and moved away from the vehicle.  Vapor from the broken piping was released into the atmosphere.  Super Flame Gas personnel (along with volunteer Fire Dept. personnel) approached truck and closed a valve on the rear end of the truck to stop the leak.

Customer handled the clean up.,When the driver went to unload he hooked up a special fitting we have for these trailers.  The special fitting incorporates a bleeder valve in to it so we can clear the lines if need me in the middle of delivery.  This fitting sticks out a bit more than a standard fitting.  On the original model containers like this that we bought some had come with an external discharge valve fitting that was machined slightly different.  With the weight of a hose hanging off this extended fitting it would pull down on the gasket enough to create a gap and allow product to leak out.  The fix was to use slightly thicker gaskets and were issued and utilized when making these deliveries.  This driver did not have one.  He took the special fitting out and used a regular reducer fitting which worked just fine to finish the offload.  We are now working on a plan to get a report of those trailers that have had a fitting replaced over the years and any that haven't will be replaced as they are routed in for any maintenence.  This will eliminate the need to try and ensure the drivers have this thicker gasket and not having it when the need arises.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

Ended upside down, driver felt for seatbelt and dropped down. Pain in right pec and neck. A witness called for emergency responders.   The 1000gal cargo tank separated from the vehicle during the roll over. Pressure change resulted in the laden product rapidly flashing into dry ice with trace vapors escaping from the exposed piping/ports. Fire department applied a wet patch over the tank leaving at least 1 port able to depressurize the vessel. Sealing the cargo tank from venting would create a greater potential of danger. The dry ice slowly continued to exhaust from the tank within possession of the remediation group that recovered and stored it - duration unknown. Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) representative arrived on scene to assess - no dangers or adverse environmental effects, and ensured fuel spill was arranged.  Driver was coherent with emergency responders and taken to the hospital as a direct result of the vehicle roll. Fire department used the emergency response hotline from the driver's manifest. Company operations and safety officials coordinated with all emergency responders, remediation, state environmental. The tank and vehicle were cleared from the scene. PD Officer confirmed that the road closures were NOT due to the hazardous materials, rather the vehicle and tank blocking traffic. The driver was verified to be current in their DOT physical and hours of service limitations at the time of incident.

The container was isolated and notified to NRC (report#1292617) and IDEM (report#94237).  The shipper, Hapag-Lloyd (630-328-1497), representative was notified by CSXI Customer Service, cris file#379360.  CSXT emergency response contractor, HEPACO Environmental, was dispatched to the scene and found several bales of recycled plastics releasing liquid (about 15gals inside container and 2gals outside onto asphalt). Release due to bales of recycle plastics loaded, stacked, and pressed allowing residual liquids to accumulate. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper. Contractor personnel secured the release by transfer of lading from intermodal shipping container HBLU320231 into HBLU318336; deconned spilled areas; and cleaned up the release site.   HBLU320231…the original freight container, now empty, is also reported to be an Undeclared HazMat shipment.  The shipper could not provide certification of clean & purge for the bales of recycle plastics.  The bales retained the DOT Labels for UN1197.  HBLU318336…the freight container the lading was transferred into, was billed as a HazMat shipment per the shipper provided SDS:  UN1197, Extract Flavorings, 3, III.
