COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS CONTACTED BY THE ST. LOUIS RMCC, REPORTING A LEAKING TANK CAR THAT WAS LOCATED NORTH OF PALM DALE.  THE KERN COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON SITE AND HAD REQUESTED A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RAILROAD RESPOND TO THE LOCATION.  MANAGER COOPER CONTACTED THE KERN COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT DISPATCH CENTER, AND RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM THE ON SITE ENGINE COMPANY THROUGH THE DISPATCH CENTER.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN NOTIFIED BY THE SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT, WHO HAD NOTED THE TANK CAR LEAKING WHILE DRIVING PAST THE TRAIN ON THE ADJACENT HIGHWAY.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS REPORTING THE TANK CAR LEAKING FROM THE SAFETY RELIEF VALVE AT A RATE OF 2-4 GALLONS PER HOUR.  WHILE RESPONDING TO THE AREA, DEVELOPED TANK CAR GATX 10393, WAS IN A TRAIN MWCEU-28 WHICH WAS IN THE ANSEL SIDING DUE TO THE TRAIN CREW TYING UP ON THE HOURS OF SERVICE, JUST NORTH OF ROSAMOND, CALIFORNIA.  THE CONTENTS OF THE TANK CAR WERE IDENTIFIED AS MINERAL SPIRITS WITH A FLASH POINT OF GREATER THAN 100 DEGREES.  IT APPEARED THAT THE PRODUCT WAS HEATING UP AND EXPANDING DUE TO THE TEMPERATURES.  AMBIENT TEMPERATURES FOR THE MOJAVE AREA WERE IN THIS RANGE, HOWEVER, WITH NIGHT TIME APPROACHING, THE TEMPERATURES WOULD DROP SOMEWHAT.  ATTEMPTS TO LOCATED THE SHIPPER THROUGH CHEMTREC PROVED FUTILE, AS THE SHIPPING PAPERS ONLY SHOWED ""AGENT SP"" IN SANTA FEE SPRINGS.  UPON MY ARRIVAL, MET WITH JOHN POMYKATA, MGR, TRAIN OPERATIONS, BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA, WHO STATED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD BRIEFED HIM ON THE INCIDENT.  AFTER HE ADVISED THEM OF MY ESTIMATED ARRIVAL TIME, THEY DEPARTED THE AREA.  THE TANK CAR WAS NOT LEAKING AT THIS POINT AND THE TEMPERATURES HAD DROPPED FROM THE DAY TIME HIGH.  A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE KERN COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON SITE AND WAS BRIEFED ON THE INCIDENT.  INSPECTION OF THE TANK CAR, WHICH IS A DUAL COMPARTMENTED CAR, INDICATED PRODUCT HAD ESCAPED FROM THE MANWAY ON THE ""A"" END OF THE TANK CAR.  THE PRODUCT TRAIL DOWN THE SIDES OF THE TANK CAR SHOWED SIGNS OF A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE COMMODITY ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 20 GALLONS, DRIPPING INTO THE ROADWAY BALLAST BETWEEN THE TRACKS.  INSPECTION OF THE MANWAY NOTED ALL 8 OF THE MANWAY SWING BOLTS WERE LOOSE AND COULD BE TURNED BY HAND.  UPON OPENING THEN MANWAY COVER PLATE, THE LIQUID LEVEL OF THE PRODUCT WAS ONLY FIVE INCHES BELOW THE OF LIP OF THE MANWAY NOZZLE.  THERE WAS LITTLE TO NO GASKING MATERIAL LEFT ON THE MANWAY COVER PLATE.  THE COVER PLATE WAS CLEANED TO REMOVED THE EXISTING GASKET REMANENT AND A TEMPORARY GASKET WAS FORMED UTILIZING GORE-TEX MATERIAL.  THE COVER PLATE WAS THEN CLOSED AND THE SWING BOLTS PROPERLY SECURED UTILIZING A WRENCH.  INSPECTION OF THE MANWAY LOCATED ON THE ""B"" END OF THE TANK CAR FOUND THE SAME IDENTICAL CONDITION.

A CHASSIS WAS COVERED IN PLASTIC SHEETING AND ONCE THE CONTAINER WAS SET TO THE CHASSIS THE PLASTIC SHEETING WAS USED TO ""DIAPER"" THE CONTAINER, WHERE IT COULD BE MOVED TO THE CUSTOM'S DOCK AND PLACE INT HE CONTAINMENT AREA.  THE LIQUID ON THE BOTTOM CONTAINER HAD DRIED, SO IT WAS PLACED ON A CHASSIS AND ALSO MOVED TO THE CUSTOM'S DOCK WHERE IT COULD BE CONTAINED AND SECURED.  SOMEONE HAD PHOTOCOPIED A CLASS 9 PLACARD, AND REDUCED IT TO THE POINT WHERE IT WOULD FIT ON A STANDARD 8 1/2 BY 11 INCH PIECE OF PAPER, AND THEN ATTACHED IT TO THE SIDES AND ENDS OF THE CONTAINER WITH CLEAR TAPE.  INSPECTION OF THE LEAKING LADING DEVELOPED THE ENTIRE CONTENTS TO BE  18 EACH, ONE TON ""SUPER SACKS"" ON PALLETS, THAT WERE IN VARIOUS OFF SET POSITIONS WITHIN THE CONTAINER.  SEVERAL 1/2 INCH STEEL STRAPS WERE ATTACHED TO THE INTERNAL FLOOR ""D"" RINGS AT THE REAR OF THE CONTAINER, AND THEN CROSSED IN A ""X"" PATTERN, AND SECURED TO THE TOP ""D"" RINGS.

THE BILLING INFORMATION SHOWED THIS COMMODITY TO BE A SOLID, AND IT WAS APPARENT THE COMMODITY HAD LIQUIFIED AND LEAKED THROUGH THE FABRIC MATERIAL OF THE BAGS, AND IN SEVERAL OTHER CASES, THE SACKS HAD TOPPLED, ALLOWING THE LIQUID TO ESCAPE FROM THE TIED CLOSURE. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THE SHIPPER, YANG MING MARINE LINES, FAILED DUE TO THE LATENESS OF THE DAY.  THERE WERE NO SHIPPING DOCUMENTS LOCATED WITHIN THE CONTAINER.  EFFORTS TO LOCATE THE ORIGINAL SHIPPER THROUGH CHEMTREC FAILED DUE TO A LACK OF PRODUCT AND SHIPPING INFORMATION FROM THE SACKS.  AS THE CONTAINER WAS SECURED AND ISOLATED, IT WAS LEFT OVER NIGHT UNTIL INFORMATION COULD BE OBTAINED THROUGH YANG MING.

UPON OPENING THE REAR DOORS, OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED AT FIRST TO BE PROPER BLOCKING AND BRACING, RESTRAINING THE CONTENTS OF 55 GALLON DRUMS.  A SHEET OF PLYWOOD WAS AGAINST THE BACKSIDE OF THE 2X6 LUMBER BULKHEAD, HOWEVER, NUMEROUS SHEETS OF CARD BOARD AND A USED UPRIGHT PALLET WERE BETWEEN THE PLYWOOD AND THE DRUMS.  THERE WAS A SECOND TIER CONSISTING OF FIVE(5) ROWS OF DRUMS LOADED IN A 4X4X4 PATTERN IN THE NOSE OF THE CONTAINER.  THESE DRUMS WERE SEPARATED FROM THE FLOOR LOADED DRUMS WITH THE USE OF CARD BOARD SHEETING.  THE SECOND TIER DRUMS WERE HELD IN PLACE WITH A 2X6 BULKHEAD THAT WAS PLACED ON THE FLOOR OF THE CONTAINER AND EXTENDED TO THE TOPS OF THE SECOND TIER DRUMS. THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OF THIS BULKHEAD, OTHER THEN THE REMAINING DRUMS THAT WERE FLOOR LOADED TO THE REAR.

IN THAT THE CONTENTS WERE NOT ACTIVELY LEAKING, IT WAS DECIDED TO SECURE THE CONTAINER UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING.

WHEN THIS NUMBER WAS CALLED, IT WAS ANSWERED BY CHEMTREC, WHO AGAIN, WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE SHIPPER, AND HAD NO INFORMATION ON SEA BRIDGE IN HOUSTON.  EVERGREEN WAS RECONTRACT AND ADVISED TO HAVE THE SHIPPER CONTACT MANAGER COOPER.  ON WEDNESDAY, MANAGER COOPER RECEIVED A CALL FROM BDP, A FREIGHT FORWARDER, WHO PROVIDED THE ORIGIN SHIPPER.  CONTACT WAS MADE WITH A  EMERGENCY RESPONSE COORDINATOR FOR NALCO EXXON, NAPERVILLE, ILLINOIS, WHO WAS ADVISED OF THE CONDITION OF THE LADING.  IN THAT THE LOADING AND BLOCKING AND BRACING WAS IMPROPER, NALCO WAS ADVISED THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSLOAD OF THE DRUMS.

AFTER SOME DISCUSSION, IT WAS DECIDED ONE OF NALCO'S HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CONTRACTORS WOULD ADDRESS THE REWORKING OF THIS CONTAINER.  ON THURSDAY,  NALCO'S CONTRACTOR ARRIVED TO WORK THE LOAD.
