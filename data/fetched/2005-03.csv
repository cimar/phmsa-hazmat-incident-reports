We dispatched our employees with diapers and booms to the site immediately.

After notifying his supervisor, he donned a full-face respirator and chemical suit.  He checked the drum closure and he felt that drum should be placed into a salvage drum to ensure proper containment.  He used oil-dry to absorb the solvent and placed that material in the salvage drum as well.  He called back his supervisor to inform that the cleanup and repackaging was complete.  The driver started driving again and began to feel ill a few minutes after the placing the drum in the salvage drum.  He again called his supervisor to inform him of the issue.  Being as he was approaching the port of entry scales at Kemmerer, WY and he was instructed to pull over at that location.  The Lincoln County Sheriff office in Kemmerer was called by the supervisor and requested that they dispatch EMS to assist the ailing driver.  The Sheriff dispatched an ambulance, fire department, and officers to meet the driver.  Also stationed at the scale was WY State Police.  The driver was taken to a local hospital, given oxygen, seen by a doctor and released by the doctor back to duty.  This took about an hour from when he stopped at the scale from when he was released from the hospital.  The fire department allowed the trailer to ventilate the fumes while the driver was at the hospital.  The scale was closed during this period.  After the driver returned to the scale, he confirmed that no other drums had leaked on the load, and continued on.  It was later determined that the gasket on the drum was pinched which allowed a small amount of material to escape.  When the drum arrived at the destination the next day, it was pump into a tank and the drum was crushed prior to disposal.",Actions taken include training with driver to ensure trailers are ventilated prior to entry with a FFAPR when a solvent leak/spill is discovered.

The spill was cleaned up and remediated per the Oklahoma Corporation Commission requirements.,Remind employees that the loading procedures require the loading process to be terminated in case of a leak.

It was in a small, non-reinforced foam cooler with one identically packed diagnostic fecal-swab.  There was no absorbent, dunnage to secure against sifting, or anything else therein.  The lid was secured by two pieces of scotch-tape.  The ""BIOHAZARD(universal)ISOLATION"" Sticker was only accompanied by the shipping labels: ""WVMC Caldwell, ID"" and ""To: State Lab Boise, ID""  There are no shipper's papers or waybill.        Along with this cooler, there was the usual cooler from South West District Health Department in Caldwell.  It is a large, plastic-reinforced cooler with a capacity upward of five gallons, and is labeled ""Inner Package{sic} Comply with Prescribed Specifications"".  There are no addresses present for Shipper or Consignee.         It contained, as always, a mixed content.  There were numerous Diagnostic Specimens(Class 6.2 trade exemption, if properly packaged and labeled)in zip-loc pocketed bio-bags.  {Every Diagnostic Specimen is sent in one of these bags except Tuberculosis Sputum, which is always placed in cans} There were several different sizes of water bottles for the testing of drinking water, and assorted cold-packs.  No absorbent or dunnage was present.  The lid was completely unsecured.       I have notified both of these shippers, and their courier (Action Courier DOT Reg# 808617)on numerous occasions of their violations of 49CFR and Federal HMR.  I have given all parties involved a 15 page print-up from the E-CFR.  I have written them non-compliance letters, which go unheeded.  Their response has been, instead, only complaints to my superiors.  They are, now, knowingly and willfully violating these regulations.        Action courier's driver has responded to verbal notifications with the response, ""How do I know that those are dangerous goods?"" and, ""that's not my responsibility,"" rebuking my efforts.  I have provided the CFR sections that show him how to meet exemption requirements, and specific articles de-bunking any possible misconceptions held.          Action Courier Service does, currently, have one delivery van that delivers to me daily.  She knows the medical courier exemption, and follows it properly.  I suspect this would be involved in a false claim of practices, and demonstrate criminality by doing so.","Another Courier, Gopher-It, has at least started inspecting packages for proper labeling after notifications.  Some of their customers now, have become less than cooperative.      I will attach images from SCDH in Twin Falls' specimens; received last week.  This shipper has been given the greatest number of notices and has, thankfully, at least ceased her argumentative phone calls:  I would like a second opinion of her claim made in an e-mail:          I appreciate your concern about our packaging of diagnostic samples.  I  have contacted the U.S. DOT representative who told me that our  packaging of diagnostic samples in the overpacks that we have meets  current requirements.

Second man got out and was searching around home for fill location while the driver inserted the delivery ticket & engaged the PTO.  Driver got out of truck & noticed that hose (at rear of truck on reel) had ruptured.  Driver notified office to call 911, shut down valves, stopped traffic, and initiated clean-up procedures.  Fire and emergency personnel had responded, detoured traffic, and helped in the completion of the clean-up.  Some fuel was released into a waterway, so the PA Fish Commision was notified.  A spill response team was notified and has since arrived to verify that clean-up was completed correctly.  Rupture was apparently caused by wear in the hose.  Estimated size of tear 1-2"". Duration of release approximately 1 minute or less. Our hoses are inspected periodically, but most hoses appear worn from early on, due to the circumstances of their use. This specific hose has been replaced and all drivers are warned to keep the secondary valves at the rear of the truck closed until the time of delivery. Department of Environmental Protection was notified and we will formally meet with them on April 4, 2005 to further investigate the incident.","Drivers have been notified (in writing) to keep all valves closed until time of actual delivery to homeowner.  We will pull all hoses from reel each summer and do a more thorough inspection.  However, pinpointing the time in which a hose must be replaced is not a science.

We contacted Hanover Fire Department immediately.  Our personnel arrived on scene at approximately 0715 and began determining other materials on the vechicle.  We then called IMS Environmental Services and notified them of the incident and asked for a response team to assist.  Hanover FD arrived at 0735 and we began briefing them of the incident and what our intentions were.  We informed the fire depatment of all of the materials on the truck and there was no dangers.  IMS arrived at 0930 and began investigating the magnitude of the release and neutrilizing the area.  It was determined by VA Department of Environmental Quality that the area be neutrilized and washed down into a nearby drain.    After the intial investigation we found that a vertical crack had been made in the side of the IBC from approximately 3/4 from the top all the way to the bottom.  The IBC was strapped to the wall of the truck with a load bar in front of it.  There were no protrusions on the side of the vehicle.    We have contacted the manufacturer of the IBC to ask for assistance in determining the problem.  We are confident that we will get positive information from them, as it was clearly a container failure.

It was a 4-compartment cargo tank.  1 compartment had nonhazardous material and was not damaged.  1 compartment was empty.  2 compartments had the hazardous material and both of them had the washout cap on the top of the trailer compromised.  About 2000 gal of product spilled out.  Local highway patrol directed traffic.  A crew from First Response was dispatched to perform corrective actions.  They were guided by the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, the Highway Patrol and Tennessee Dept of Transportation. The locals onsite prior to First Response's arrival created a dam around the spilled product. A vacuum truck was used to clean up the spilled product.  The site was deemed clean by the local officials.","Better detouring options would have prevented this accident.  This was a narrow winding road that was dangerous for trucks to be on.

While unloading the trailer, an Onyx employee inadvertently punctured a 55-gallon steel drum of trichloroethylene with the forklift.  The forklift was positioned under a pallet of containers which was loaded directly in front of the 55-gallon drum.  The fork of the forklift protruded out of the back side of the pallet and punctured the base of the drum, just above the bottom chime.  The puncture resulted in a 1"" by 4"" hole in the drum.  When the employee backed away from the drum, he noticed the drum to be leaking and immediately responded by tipping the drum on it's side to stop the release.  He exited the trailer and began containment procedures by placing oil-dry (clay) at the back of the trailer to contain the material on the trailer.  A portion of the material leaked through the floor of the trailer and out the back of the trailer where it collected in a blind sump designed specifically for spill containment.  The unloading area is a concrete decline ramp that is epoxy coated and designed to provide secondary containment for such spills.  The duration of release was approximately one minute.  The on-site spill response team at the facility was notified and clean-up began within 10 minutes of release.  The clean-up was conducted while wearing appropriate PPE and included washing the trailer floor, trailer exterior, secondary containment area and removing the accumulated liquids from clean-up activities using a vacuum truck (site owned and operated).  The 55-gallon drum was placed into an 85-gallon DM overpack container, marked and labeled in accordance with DOT requirements, and shipped to the final destination.  The manifest was annotated to identify that a spill occurred in transit and the drum was over-packed.","The Onyx employee that punctured the drum was re-trained on the proper unloading techniques and use of a forklift.  A notice of the incident was posted in the unloading area, and was reviewed with other employees performing similar duties as part of a safety training meeting.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Onyx Environmental Services, LLC",US,

Chester Operations Center is an EPA  Conditional Exempt Small Quantity Generator and does not have an EPA Identification Number.  This shipment was made under Manifest Document Number SCEXEMPT — 05001.  The hazardous waste shipment from the Chester Operations Center included three 55-gallon containers of hazardous waste. The hazardous waste shipment was enroute to Onyx Environmental Services, located at Creedmoor, North Carolina. Duke Power was the initial transporter of the hazardous waste. After leaving the Chester Operations Center, the DPC driver observed liquid dripping from the trailer (Trailer 9026) at 2:04 PM. He pulled off the road at exit 80, 1-85 North near Spartanburg, South Carolina. The DPC driver built a dike to contain any minor spillage until cleanup crew arrived. Approximately one gallon had leaked from the drum. Spill was reported to in-house DPC Environmental personnel at 2:24pm. Spill was cleaned-up by Duke Power Company the same day. The weather conditions during this incident were clear and cool.  Only one drum was leaking. The contents of the leaking drum were pumped into another drum. The leak originated from the bottom of the drum, but several irLches from the seam. The apparent cause of the leak was due to deterioration of the metalL bottom. Leak is believed to have started due to the drum’s bottom being deteriorated enough to start leaking after vibration while in transit. The drum was marked “UN1A2/Y1.2/100/USA/R1264/O2RL.” The content of the drum was primarily water contaminated with gasoline. The waste codes of DOOl (Ignitable), DOlO (Selenium), and D018 (Benzene) were assigned to the waste stream.","The hazardous waste discharge from the metal drum was due to the drums deteriorated condition that was not discovered until the leak occurred after being vibrated during transportation. Duke Power EHS personnel, drivers, and warehouse personnel are in the process of being made aware of this DOT incident and recommendations. The emphasis to applicable Duke Power Company personnel is to not ship any drum that they question as being suitable for shipment. If a drum is in questionable condition, it is better to repackage or over-pack the drum. If a drum is exposed to weather, personnel are to make a better effort in evaluating the drum’s condition prior to usage.",No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,DUKE POWER COMPANY,US,

When I interviewed Mr. Hayek he informed me that he was in the process of switching Seeler #1 track when the incident occurred. He informed me that the crew had went into Seeler #1 track and coupled up all the cars (including making air joints) then pulled the track out until the hind car (GATX 19661- a shipper to be brought back to Joliet) was on the phoenix lead at the bottom of the hifi. Mr. Hayek stated that after tying a handbrake on the subject car he cut away from it and pulled the balance of the cars into the clear on PHX 2 i:rack. The crew then lined the switches for the west end of the Phoenix yard into PHXi track. Once these switches were lined Hayek bled the subject car off, released the handbrake, and then rode the car down into PHX 1 track in order to control the cars speed (PHX 1 track was where the crew was building their outbound train). Mr. Hayek then walked back towards the west end of the Phoenix yard in order to do his next move bul: noticed some smoke coming from between the rails near the PHX 2 track switch. He stated that he threw dirt onto the smoking area until it. stopped smoking and then continued with his next move in order to switch Seeler #1 track. This move was to shove west out of PHX 2 track and into the Seeler 1&2 track lead where the crew would cut off three cars that were to eventually get respotted in Seeler #1 track (the cars that were getting cut off here were GATX 61179, UTLX 200600, and UTLX 200651). After cutting these cars off the crew pulled ahead until KCPX 17229 (another shipper to be brought back to Joliet) Was on the phoenix lead at the bottom of the hifi and then tied a hand brake on it and cut away just as they had done in the earlier move. After doing this the crew once again pulled the balance of the cars into the clear on PHX 2 track, lined the switches at the west end of the phoenix yard for PHX 1 track, and then bled the subject: car off and released the handbrake in order to allow the car to roliL into PHX 1 track where it would tie onto their outbound train (Mr. Hayek did not ride this car into PHX 1 track to control the speed as he usually only does that for loads and this car was an empty). Once this car made it into the clear on PHX 1 track Mr. Hayek began to line his train out of PHX 2 track and up the hill at the phoenix where he would tie onto KCPX 17223 for his next move (this car was to be spotted at the same spot that the cr he had just dropped onto his outbound train was spotted). However, when he lined the PHX 1 track switch and the Seeler 1&2 lead switch he saw flames coming from the area under the three cars that he had cut off on the Seeler 1&2 track lead. Mr. Hayek said that this made him panic so he ran towards the three cars, tripped at some point on the way there (he did not have any",,No,TANK CAR,Pressure,105A,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,
