AFTER ARRIVING AT THE TERMINAL I FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF 3RD SHIFT DOCK WORKERS HAD BEEN EVACUATED AND SENT TO AN AREA OUTSIDE THE TERMINAL. WHEN I ARRIVED INSIDE TWO DOCK SUPERVISORS (QUALIFIED AS HAZ/MAT TECHNICIANS) WERE ON THE SCENE NEUTRALIZING THE AREA INSIDE THE TRAILER WITH SODA ASH. THE DRIVER OF THE TOW MOTOR HAD PUNCTURED TWO PLASTIC GALLON DRUMS THAT WERE LOADED SIDE BY SIDE ON THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER. THE TOWMOTOR OPERATOR HAD LOST CONTROL OF HIS VEHICLE WHEN A PIECE OF WOOD BECAME LODGED UNDER THE BACK END OF THE TOWMOTOR. AS A RESULT HE WAS UNABLE TO PULL THE TOWMOTOR FORKS FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CONTAINER. WE WERE QUITE FORTUNATE THAT THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THE FORKS ACTED AS A PLUG, PREVENTING COMPLETE LOSS OF THE MATERIAL. THE FORK HOLES WERE AT THE VERY BOTTOM OUTSIDE AREA.  INFO TRAC WAS NOTIFIED AND THEY SENT A SULFURIC ACID MSDS OVER THE FAX WITHIN MINUTES. SHORTLY AFTER RECEIVING THIS FAX, INFO TRAC CONTACTED THE SHIPPER AND WE WERE SENT THE CORRECT MSDS ON THIS (SULFURIC ACID MIXTURE).

LEAVING THE MINERAL CITY, OHIO STATE LOCATION, KENNY TRAVELED WEST ON COUNTY ROAD 110 TO NORTH BOUND ROUTE 800. THEN NORTH BOUND INTERSTATE 77 TO WEST BOUND ROUTE 30. THEN TO NORTH BOUND ROUTE 23 AND 15 TO EAST BOUND ROUTE 330 AND INTO THE VANLUE, OHIO SITE LOCATION. KENNY INDICATED HE SECURED THE LOAD AND LOCKED THE DOOR WITH A PAD LOCK UPON LEAVING THE MINERAL CITY LOCATION. PASSING THROUGH THE WOOSTER, OHIO AREA, HE WAS FOLLOWED BY STATE HIGHWAY PATROL FOR ABOUT 2 MILES WITHOUT ANY INDICATION OF A PROBLEM. TURNING ONTO THE ROUTE 30 BYPASS AROUND BUCYRUS, OHIO, KENNY SAID HE MADE EYE CONTACT WITH A P.U.C. O. OFFICER WHICH HAD A TRACTOR-TRAILER RIG PULLED TO THE SIDE FOR AN INSPECTION AND AGAIN THERE WAS NO INDICATION BY THE OFFICER THAT A PROBLEM WAS OCCURRING. HE THEN STOPPED IN CRESTLINE, OHIO, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 48 MILES FROM HIS DESTINATION, TO CHECK HIS TIRES AND INDICATED THE DOORS WERE SECURE AT THAT TIME. KENNY SAID HE HAS NO INDICATION THAT THE DOOR HAD COME OPEN UNTIL HE TURNED INTO THE ENTRANCE AT THE VANLUE SITE. AS SOON AS HE DISCOVERED THE OPEN DOOR, HE STOPPED AND FOUND A PACKAGE LYING BEHIND THE TRAILER. HE FELT THE DOOR HAD JUST COME OPEN AT THAT POINT BECAUSE OF THE DROP OFF FROM THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY TO THE SITE ENTRANCE AND THE FACT THE LOAD LOCKING DEVICES WERE STILL IN PLACE. THE BOARD USED TO BLOCK AND SECURE THE LOAD AHEAD OF THE LOAD LOCKS HAD BEEN BROKEN SOME HOW. THE PRODUCT WAS LEAVING ITS ORIGINAL PLACEMENT THROUGH THIS OPENING. THE FIRST POLY WOVEN BAG WAS REPORTED BY A PERSON TO THE HANCOCK COUNTY SHERIFF DEPARTMENT AT ABOUT 07:52 AM. KENNY ARRIVED AT HIS DESTINATION AROUND 07:00 AM. AN INVENTORY AT THE CARGO INDICATED ELEVEN OF THE BAGS WERE MISSING. A SEARCH OF THE ROUTE BY COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES, STATE HIGHWAY PATROL, A PATROL HELICOPTER, P.U.C.O., AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, DISCOVERED 9 BAGS WITHIN 8 MILES OF THE DRIVERS DESTINATION. ONE OF THE PACKAGES HAD BEEN CRUSHED BY A PASSING MOTOR VEHICLE. THERE WAS NO PACKAGE FAILURE DUE TO THE FALL FROM THE TRAILER UNIT. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT, NINE OF THE ELEVEN PACKAGES WERE FOUND. FOUR IN HANCOCK COUNTY AND FIVE IN WYANDOT COUNTY. PREPARATIONS ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY TO SECURE EACH TRAILER IN THE FLEET BY BOLTING OR WELDING AN ADDITIONAL STRIP OF METAL TO OVERLAP FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR TO THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR. THIS EXTRA OVERLAP WOULD RE QUIRE THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR OF THE TRAILER, WHICH WAS THE DOOR THAT OPENED, TO BECOME UN-HINDGED IN ORDER TO OPEN AS LONG AS THE PASSENGER DOOR REMAINED LATCHED AND CLOSED. NO REASONABLE EXPLANATION HAS BEEN DETERMINED AS TO HOW OR WHY THIS DOOR COULD HAVE OPENED WHEN THE TOP AND BOTTOM LATCH MECHANISM WAS IN PLACE WHEN THE VEHICLE LEFT IT'S ORIGIN AND THE HANDLE WHICH CONTROLS THE LATCHING MOVEMENT WAS STILL IN IT'S LOCKED POSITION WHEN THE DRIVER FIRST DISCOVERED THE DOOR HAD OPENED.",,No,BAG PLASTIC,Sift proof woven plastic bag,5H2,No,,,,,,,690,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10,,US,

I VISUALLY INSPECTED THE OUTERMOST PACKAGING FOR ANY TYPE OF MARKINGS OR LABELS, BUT DID NOT FIND ANY AT ALL THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CONTENTS IN THE PACKAGE MIGHT BE A HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. I THEN OPENED THE PACKAGE AND FOUND TWO INNER FIBERBOARD BOXES, ONE OF WHICH APPEARED TO BE LEAKING. I ALSO NOTICED THAT BOTH INNER FIBERBOARD BOXED WERE PRESTAMPED """"THIS SIDE UP"", BUT DUE TO THEIR HEIGHT WERE PLACED ON THEIR SIDES AGAINST ORIENTATION, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO ONE OF THE INNER PLASTIC TO LEAK. ALSO FURTHER INSPECTION OF THE INNER PLASTIC RECEPTACLES REVEALED THAT ON THE RECEPTACLE THE CLOSURE WAS NOT PROPERLY APPLIED. BOTH INNER FIBERBOARD BOXES EACH CONTAINED 3X2 QUARTS EACH OF ""NAPHTHA, HYDROTREATED HEAVY"" NONE OF THE INNER PLASTIC RECEPTACLES CLOSURES WERE SECURED BY POSITIVE MEANS. THE SHIPMENT WAS PUT INTO A PLASTIC BAG AND WE RETURNED TO THE HAZMAT SORT BUILDING AND REPACKED IT INTO A UN1A1 SALVAGE DRUM THEN PLACED IT INTO OUR SECURITY CAGE UNDER LOCK AND KEY.
