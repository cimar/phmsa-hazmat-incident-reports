During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at an in transit storage facility pending final delivery.  During a routine inspection, it was discovered that a small amount of material had leaked from a packaged onto the floor of the van trailer and the parking area where the vehicle was staged.  Facility personnel immediately initiated a response and after donning the appropriate personnel protective equipment, entered the trailer, identified the leaking package and placed it into a suitable salvage drum.  IN addition, all clean-up debris was collected and placed into the salvage drum.  Once complete, the shipment was received by the intended facility and properly disposed of.  It is believed that the cause of the release can be attributed to a pinhole leak that developed on the bottom of the container.","At the time the containers were accepted for transportation, no evidence of leaking was observed.  The driver was advised of the incident and was re-instructed to insure that before accepting any container for transportation he must insure that any external corrosion or rust be further inspected to insure the structural integrity of the container will withstand the rigors of transportation.  If any container is of suspect condition, proper steps must be initiated to either place the container into a suitable salvage drum or re containerize before transportation.

After donning the appropriate personal protective equipment, he utilized his spill kit and the absorbent pads to contain the leak.  He attempted to slow the leak by putting vacuum on the trailer until the response crew arrived.  The response crew set up trenches to stop any groundwater contamination and began transferring the material into portable totes.  The Ohio EPA was notified and assigned case number 1004-18-829 to the incident.  The local fire department sent a representative out by car to observe the cleanup along with the Ohio EPA.  They were both satisfied with the cleanup efforts and left.  A 20 cubic yard roll off container was sent to remove the contaminated soil.  Once emptied, the cargo tank was placed out of service and sent to a maintenance facility for repairs and re-inspection.  The totes containing the remainder of the material (757 gallons) and the contaminated soil were taken to the intended waste disposal facility.","At the time the cargo tank was loaded, the driver identified no issues and/or deficiencies with the cargo tank during his pre-trip inspection.  The driver's actins taken during the trip succeeded in identifying the issue and his initial response activities controlled the spill and prevented a more serious release.  All drivers will continue to conduct their required inspections and will take those actions necessary to minimize the effects of any release that occurs during transportation.

Last night at approximately 8:00 pm I received a call from Frank McCrary with Airgas South indicating we had a release on our truck at Freightliner in Tampa. Frank and I tried to determine where the leak was coming from to see if it could be resolved while he was on site but were unsuccessful. At this time I was still at the Davenport facility in the process of loading an Aqua tanker and couldn’t immediately break free. I called our driver Mark Calvelage who is the primary driver of B-06 to get assistance. Mark called Frank and was able to determine that one of the bypass valves had been closed causing the Hydrostat on the hose reel side of the bypass to release. Mark asked Frank to slightly open the bypass valve to relieve the pressure back into the tank but were unsuccessful at getting the Hydro to reseat. I left the Davenport facility at approximately 9:00pm and called Butch Johnson to advise of the situation. I arrived on site at approximately 10:00pm. Frank and Jim Sumner, also with Airgas South, were on scene. At this time all pressure had been relieved and there was no indication of a leak. Both Frank and Jim immediately insisted that the truck be removed from the Freightliner facility. After evaluating I also determined that it was the Hydro. I told them that I could replace the Hydro and isolate the valve and that would take care of the problem but they repeatedly insisted that Freightliner wanted the truck off the property. I assured them that I would take care of getting it transported back to Davenport at which time Frank and Jim both left the Freightliner facility. I replaced the Hydro and isolated all the vales. I placed valve caps and locks on all the valves and checked for leaks with Litmus Paper and found none. I spoke to Chris Bodmer (night manager @ Freightliner) and he said as long as there were no leaks he was okay with us leaving the truck there. Chris and I went over the truck to verify any signs of leaks and he was comfortable with leaving it onsite and gave me written permission. I left Freightliner at approximately 12:15 am. I was back at Freightliner this morning at 6:40 am to verify the condition and all is fine. This morning I spoke to Vern Gelser in the service department and explained what transpired last night to make sure he was okay with leaving it and he was fine.

Upon separating the skidsthe forklift operator accidentally punctured one of the bags on the bottom skid. The area was  immediately cordon off and the Port Authority Police were notified.,The main cause of this incident was the double stacking of the dangerous goods skids while being transferred from one facility to another.

We have also requested that  our ground handling agent Cargo Airport Services provided additional training to their forklift operators.

DTS Jack Forsyth was notified and responded to the scene. He noted that there was some residue on the side of the tank near the manway but it was not an active leak. At that time it was determined that the car could be moved with care to track 210 where it could be isolated overnight and repaired by emergency response crews. Forsyth assisted the crew in slowly moving the car to track 210 to prevent further leakage. M&M Protection was called to the scene and made the necessary repairs to the tank car at approximately 900 AM on 4/8/10. It has been estimated that less than one gallon of product leaked from the tank car down the sides of the tank shell. A very small amount of product was noted on the ballast. M&M neutralized the product on the ground and cleaned the sides of the tank.",The shipper J R Simplot was notified of the issues with JRSX 1006.

As the truck made the turn from W. Interstate Block Rd (Westbound) to (Northbound) Borcherding Rd, the driver cut the corner too short and the right side trailer tires left the roadway and dropped into a drainage culvert. This resulted in the tractor trailer rolling over onto it's right side.     Madison Township Fire Department was dispatched to the scene. FD personnel placed absorbant pads under a leaking manway to absorb a small leak that was present at the manway. EQ Environmental staff was dispatched to the scene as well as Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) representatives.     Holes were drilled into the left (top) side of the tanker and the product was pumped off into another tanker. The overturned tractor trailer was righted after the product was removed and towed to repair facilities. Per EQ's report, an estimated 2 to 10 gallons of product was released into containment equipment over the duration of the incident.    Summit Environmental returned to the site on April 9th, 2010 to perform remediation acitivites that included removing some soil for testing, and restoring the culvert to it's original condition.     No injuries or fatalities resulted from this incident. Three households were evacuated per the Madison Twp FD for approximately 12 hours while transfer efforts were underway.","Pinnacle Express will no longer deliver fuel to this airport utilizing the route that was taken on April 5th, 2010.

Vehicle left roadway into center grass median, striking metal guard rail with left rear of cargo tank and continued against guard rail for 15 feet until striking concrete bridge abuttment and coming to rest. Impact caused rear axle of trailer to rotate under frame of carge tank, crushing delivery piping at rear of trailer. Ther was no release of cargo. The vehicle could not be driven from scene. Another cargo tanker was dispatched to the scene and successfully transfered the cargo from the damaged cargo tanker. The cargo tank was removed from the scene by wreckers on a flatbed trailer. The entire operation lasted approximately 12 hours and was supervised by the Florida Department of Transportation. The accident caused the closure of 1 eastbound lane for 1 1/2 hours during the cargo transfer.","Given the severity of the impact damage, the packaging performed flawlessly.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Marathon Petroleum, representative Roger Spring (877-627-5463), was contacted. Summit Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene to make repairs.  Upon arrival, Summit personnel found the manway cover to be misaligned, the gasket was cracked in several places and 3 of 8 manway bolts were less than tool tight. The shipper contacted Bobby Breed of Specialized Response Systems (SRS) to assist with Summits response. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper via Bobby Breed of SRS (817-246-3338). Contractor personnel replaced the gasket, tightened the manway bolts and the leak stopped. The car was decontaminated and released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move.

WE ALSO PUT DOWN ABSORBENT MATERIAL ON THE PRODUCT SPILLED OUT ON TO THE GROUND AND THEN MADE TWO BERMS OR DAMS IN THE ROAD DITCH TO KEEP THE SPILLED PRODUCT FROM LEAVING THE SITE.  WE GOT A WRECKER OUT TO THE SITE AND LIFTED THE TANK UP AND OUT OF THE DITCH AND THEN WITH AN AUXILIARY TANK AND PUMP WE PULLED THE REMAINING PRODUCT OFF OF THE WRECKED TANK TRUCK INTO ANOTHER TANK TRUCK FOR SAFE KEEPING.  WE ALSO HAD BODINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPOND TO THE ACCIDENT SITE WITHIN A COUPLE HOURS TO SUPERVISE IN CONTAINING THE SPILLAGE AND PUT DOWN FRESH ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND PULL UP THE SATURATED ABSORBENT AND AFTER APPROVAL FROM THE RESPONDING EPA REPRESENTATIVE THE SITE WAS AGAIN SERVICE AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING BY BODINES TO PULL UP THE SATURATED ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND PUT DOWN NEW.

The bottom carton was removed from the pallet and opened. One jug was found to be crushed and the bottom and was slightly dripping. The jug was put in a 5 gallon recovery pail upside down to prevent further leaks. The driver that discovered the pallet and the other driver on the dock were questioned as to their knowledge of the damage and neither knew how the damage occurred. Very little of the product had leaked and even as the jug was lifted out of the carton the jug did not leak, presumably due to the fact that puncture was small and at the bottom of the jug which was air tight.",Raise awareness of incident that occurred with all drivers and the need to be aware while operating on the dock.

When he completed loading he closed the dome lid and tightened down the dogs on the dome cover.  The driver didn't notice when doing this that the gasket around the dome cover had gotten pinched in the dome cover.  Since the dome cover gasket was pinched it resulted in an improper seal around the dome cover.  The driver drove away unaware there was a problem resulting in a trail of Black Liquor being spilled until the security guard noticed the spillage and immediatley stopped the driver.  The trailer was immediatley brought to a containment area where the spilled product was cleaned off and absorbent socks and wood chips were put in place to absorb the black liquor.  Walker Industrial services was contacted immediatley by Sappi Fine Papers personnel for the clean up.  Tom Griffen from Sappi Fine Papers conducted sampling and testing and reported no damage was done, just the clean up was involved.  Some of the Black Liquor did enter the Sappi Fine sewage drains.  Tom Griffin completed testing on the sedimentation ponds and the results were in normal ranges for discharge from ponds 1, 2, and 3.",Driver will be counseled on proper cargo securement.  A full review will be performed and additional training will be provided to the driver as needed.  The driver must ensure he has a good seal on the dome cover and through additional training and disciplinary actions Superior Carriers will ensure this driver understands the requirements.

Other motorists noticed it or got some on their vehicles and got him to pull over (we paid to have the vehicles involved cleaned).  He noticed a steady stream coming from where the valve bolts up to the trailer.  We transferred the product from compartment 2 into compartment 1 and is holding.  DOT released the driver and advised he did a good job.  A response team came out to clean the product off the roadway.  The cause of the leak appeared to be that the valve bolts were loose.,The valves were not loose in this example.  The product is such that it pits stainless steel.  We recognized this would be an issue over the long term so we had a special valve installed on that compartment.  At some point the trailer came in for maintenence and a simple part for that valve was broken.  The mechanic recognized he did not have that piece for this type of valve assembly and that it was not the standard valve that usually is on this type of trailer.  He had removed that valve and installed a factory valve.  Over the course of multiple loads the valve pitted through and started leaking.  As a result both the valve on compartment 2 and compartment 1 are being replaced now that the delivery was complete.  The mechanic was trained on the importance of questioning why specific parts are on a trailer that don't appear to be stock equipment.  He had the right mindset in that trailers should be kept with manufacturer parts but he also needed to understand that there may be instances in which alternate valves may be installed for specific chemicals.,No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5085,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

The plant operator, (same person that let driver into plant), verified paperwork and went to the bank of unloading pipes, signed off on the paperwork that the driver was authorized to unload and left. All unloading stations were locked except one. The driver connected to the unlocked station and proceeded to unload. Upon completion of the unloading he went to the building to get the operator and noticed liquid in a containment inside the building and ask the operator about it. Th operator went into a panic stating he was ""sorry it was the wrong valve and he was so fired"". The valve left unlocked that the driver hooked to was a sump line from the contianment around the tanks.  The product was not released into the environment but into a containment area inside a building.",Plant signage needs to be changed to show each valve in the unloading areas function better than is now showing. Retraining of plant operators on making sure drivers have hooked up to correct line prior to start of unloading process.

The trailer floor was cleaned with a cleaning compound and returned to service for continued transport to intended disposal facility.","During the response it was discovered a paint can that was collected from a household hazardous waste collection event ruptured during transportation and spilled its contents into the interior of the cubic yard container.

FSTZ 882606 was carefully removed (deramped) from this flatcar and sent to the facility's containment area for further inspection by BNSF and contract responders. A BNSF contractor removed the lading inside FSTZ 882606 to ascertain the leak source. Inspection of the lading revealed that two 55 gallon steel drums loaded atop a pallet were dented, with one of these drums having a small cut in the dent area above the bottom rolling hoop. The appearance of this damage indicated that it may have been caused by a fork lift tine during loading. The responders over-packed the damaged drum into a poly over-pack drum properly labeled. Spillage atop the intermodal flatcar and inside the trailer was wiped with absorbent pads and the trailer was left to ventilate overnight. Spent cleaning materials were placed into a container for future appropriate disposal by the response contractor.

The car was isolated and the shipper representative, LLoyd Moore (Cell phone # 416-436-2067), was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2010-04-24-000540).  A CSXT emergency response contractor, SWS/Eagle, was dispatched to the scene to make repairs.  Upon arrival, SWS/Eagle personnel reported the pressure relief vent disc retainer and its plug were not in place but rather dangling at the side of the pressure relief vent nozzle. The pressure relief vent rupture disc was missing. SWS/Eagle reported less than 5 gallons of material was atop the tank with none on the ground. SWS/Eagle personnel assembled the pressure relief vent assembly and the leak stopped.  The car was decontaminated and released for further transport.

The dock worker donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and overpacked the drum into a suitable salvage container.

After visual inspection, UTLX 46929 was carefully moved to an isolated repair track in the railyard for a detailed inspection by a BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder. The BNSF responder reported that one of the two PRD's (pressure relief device) affixed atop this tank car was the leak source. The leaking 75 psi PRD was inspected and found to have the bottom stem nuts missing which nullified valve spring operation and prevented this PRD from functioning normally; thus allowing minimal amounts of product to escape during rail movement. Non-evaporated spillage on the shell of UTLX 46929 was wiped. A replacement PRD was ordered by a shipper affiliate to be installed by UTC (Union Tank Car). On 4/29/2010, a UTC technician installed the replacement PRD and followed this installation with a tank car leak test of the PRD. The bubble leak test was completed and deemed acceptable. Response was concluded by 1000 hrs. PDT, 4/29/2010.

This flatcar was setout of the train. Later, during off loading (deramping) of intermodal containers loaded atop this flatcar, container CMAU 513601 was observed dripping an unknown liquid substance from several locations at the bottom of this container. CMAU 513601 was carefully removed and isolated in the intermodal parking area awaiting a detailed inspection. (CMAU 513601 was an export shipment destined Australia and scheduled to depart from the port of Long Beach, CA). The shipper arranged for a response contractor to inspect CMAU 513601. The responders reported finding two steel drums towards the middle of this 40 foot container partially crushed by a heavy diesel engine placed atop the drums with the only separation being a single sheet 1/2 inch particleboard. This heavy weight caused the drums to buckle and the drum's upper sidewall to crack releasing some contents. Only one of these drums was identified as containing hazardous material. The compromised drums were overpacked. Responders neutralized and cleaned the spillage inside the container, on the ground and atop the intermodal flatcar. On 4/14/2010, the responders reloaded the container properly blocked and braced for further rail transport to the destination port. The overpacked drums and some other lading that would not properly fit inside the container after the lading was reconfigured were earmarked to be returned to the origin shipper. CMAU 513601's billing was adjusted to reflect manifest change.",Ensure shipper properly blocks and braces lading inside intermodal shipping containers; and weight limitations are employed when stacked lading is utilized within the loading pattern.,No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6860,BNSF Railway Company,US,

He was climbing Saluda Mountain at 35-40 mph and was in the middle lane. He was passing a Pope Transport gasoline tractor trailer. A red Jeep was in the 3rd lane (fast lane) beginning to pass the Linde driver. A Dodge pick up truck coming up behind the Linde truck switched lanes to the 3rd lane and impacted the Jeep. The driver of the Jeep lost control and hit the vaporizer on the Linde trailer. The Jeep then hit the Pope Transport truck on its driver side.    The driver of the Jeep was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries (pain in her ankle). There was no other passenger in the Jeep.    The vaporizer was secured to the trailer by the Midland, NC Linde mechanic and the Linde driver brought it back to Midland and placed it out of service.    The driver of the Dodge truck was cited for an improper lane change.    Our driver maintained control of his vehicle and safely stopped in the emergency lane to the right.    The DOT inspection of the Linde vehicle noted no deficiencies other than the damage the Jeep had caused. Once the vaporizer and hose tube were secured the Linde vehicle was released to return to the Midland depot.",Linde vehicle and driver were not at fault.  Damage caused was minimal.

The driver proceeded to unload the product into the specified tank at the consignee site.  There was not sufficient room in the tank to hold the entire load and the tank overflowed approximately 100 gallons at the end of the transfer.  The driver was able to shut off the transfer and save an additional 250 gallons from releasing.  It was later discovered that the consignee tank digital level gauge was not properly working.  The storage tank is opaque and the level can not be viewed by drivers or operators.  No backup high level alarm was installed in the tank.

He was going to turn left (east). Dan just started to slow down to make his turn when he noticed a blue Ford Ranger pickup crossing the centerline coming towards him. Dan pulled over to the right as far as he could go without going into the ditch. He saw the older male pickup drivers eyes wide open kind of in a daze staring forward. The pickup hit our truck in the front drivers wheel, then it hit our back fender and two backsets of wheels. The pickup then rolled over ending up in the southbound lane on its roof and topper. The unidentified pickup driver died at the scene, Dan had no injuries. Dan called 911 and his supervisor Bill Wasko right alter it happened. Police preliminary speculation looks like it may have been a medical situation that caused the pickup driver to loose control of his vehicle. The Wisconsin State Patrol was at the scene and did all of the post-accident investigation work including Dan’s report of what happened and a complete bobtail inspection, which came out real good. Prescription drugs were found by the totally devastated pickup. Emergency personnel were at the scene for traffic control and the extensive parts cleanup. I called the Wisconsin Duty Officer even though there was no release, that case number is #McDonoughO426lO and I will follow up with the required DOT reports. There was no release of propane. The bobtail had 30% in it at the time of the accident and was pumped out into another bobtail brought onto the scene by Dan Saumer from our Sandstone plant. Then Ostrom’s Towing of Minong, WI, towed it to our Danbury plant. It seems the truck may be drivable to the repair shops when we replace the three wheels. Apparently there was a witness, a Schwan’s deliveryman who the State Patrol has or will be contacting. Dan did a very good job of controlling his truck and not rolling it in the ditch. All of his paperwork seemed to be in order. I will be getting a police report as soon as it comes available. Federated contacts for those at the scene are: Bill Wasko Danbury and Gordon Plants Manager 715-376-2264, mobile 715-558-6355, Mark Grave, Propane Division Manager mobile 218-522-1440, and myself Tom Rausch, Safety Director, mobile 763-286-2299. Mike Chmielecki an employee from our Gordon plant was also there helping out and can be reached through Bill Wasko. If there are any questions please call me at 763-286- 2299 and I’ll get whatever we need.",OUR DRIVER DID EVERYTHING HE COULD TO AVOID CONTACT OF THE PICKUP THAT CROSSED OVER THE CENTER LINE DEEP INTO HIS LANE.

The BOC appeared tool tight and this bottom operated bottom outlet valve (BOV) was in the closed position with its operating handle pinned. During further inspection of DBUX 300221, the FRA Inspector also found the threaded vacuum relief valve (VRV) emanating vapor forming bubbles at its threaded connection which also displayed wetness. A BNSF mechanical foreman accompanying the FRA inspector coordinated careful movement of DBUX 300221 to an isolated area in the railyard and arranged for a response contractor to fully inspect DBUX 300221. Inspection of DBUX 300221 by the BNSF contractor concurred with the aforementioned observations. The contractor vented DBUX 300221 to reduce internal pressure within the tank. This immediately eliminated vapor escaping at the base of the VRV. Visual inspection inside the tank car via the open manway surmised one gallon or less of liquid remained at the bottom of the tank. With a receptacle under the BOV, the BOC was removed to check the BOC gasket and the internal ball valve condition. The BOC had product residue inside the cap and the BOC gasket, although aged, appeared serviceable. The BOV was cycled open/closed releasing approx. 1/2 gallon of product into the receptacle. The internal ball valve appeared to allow product to by-pass this valve when in the closed position. The BOV + BOC were cleaned and resecured. Afterwards, no further product wetness was observed at the BOC.  The consignee (Tesoro Refining + Marketing Co.) requested a FRA movement approval to move DBUX 300221 to a qualified repair facility and FRA-10050295 was granted 05/19/2010.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1402,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Our transportation manager notified the duty officer, Petty Officer Huggins.  PO Huggins assigned case number 938679 to the incident report.  The telephonic report was made conservatively prior to the time at which the investigation could be completed.  After our investigation, the evidence leads us to believe that the leak of contents did not occur during transport but was limited to our facility.  Furthermore, the leak appears to have happened subsequent to the carrier relinquishing custody of the shipment to EnergySolutions.  Because of these facts, the incident was not an immediately reportable incident in accordance with 49 CFR 171.15, and a detailed report is therefore not required.  The following information is provided as clarification and background: On the  morning of April 30, 2010, personnel at the EnergySolutions Bear Creek Road Facility in Oak Ridge, TN discovered an oily residue on a transport vehicle (shipment manifest number 09-5-029) near the doors of a large freight container (container number 9260009) while removing the freight containers from the transport vehicle.  Upon further investigation, the oily residue was found on several areas of the trailer and the ground at our facility where the vehicle was a parked and the freight.  Because the freight container contained Class 7 material, a radiological survey was performed.  The areas on the transport vehicle and ground where the oily residue could be seen had detectable levels of contamination.  The shipment consisting of two large freight containers holding waste material from SERF-5 left the AREVA facility on 04/28/2010 at 10:30 a.m. for EnergySolutions located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.  The shipment arrived at the EnergySolutions facility on the afternoon of April 28, 2010 at 4:22 PM (after normal working hours).  The shipment was inspected and surveyed for radioactive material on the morning of April 29, 2010.  The radiological survey did not indicate the presence of contamination.  Radiological surveys of the transport vehicle indicated a maximum removable contamination level of about 17,000 dpm/100 cm2 of beta-gamma activity.  Assuming 10% removal efficiency, there was approximately 170,000 dpm/100 cm2 of beta-gamma total activity of the package.  The limit in this case is 220,000 dpm/100 cm2 of beta-gamma total activity on the package.EnergySolutions'' Health Physics personnel isolated the area around transport vehicle and freight containers involved in this shipment.The rear-most container (container number 9260009) was found to be leaking the oily substance from the doors.  EnergySolutions personnel constructed a cover to prevent further spread of contamination.

JIM HEWITT,TECHNICAL SUPERVISOR,,,,,Facility,On 11-April-2010 at 3:30 pm there was a 98% sulfuric acid spill at our facility. The spill was due to a bleed off line being left open on the sulfuric acid unloading line. This caused approximately 500 gallons of 98% sulfuric acid to be spilled into a earth and gravel ditch that is approximately 4 feet wide x 10 feet long x 2 feet deep. The spill was contained in this ditch and did not impact any navigable waterways.It was also discovered that there was a leaking drain line coming from the acid unloading area sump.    At 5:00 pm mill personnel began neutralization of the sulfuric acid with soda ash that was applied to the spill. This application of the soda ash took approximately 2 – 3 hours. pH readings were taken before the soda ash was applied and showed an initial pH of 1.75. After application of all soda ash the pH increased to a range of 9.0 to 5.5. The pH was again taken at 9:00 am on the morning of 12-April-2010 after agitating the liquid and read 5.9 across the ditch.    The liquid was pumped to the effluent treatment system at 12:00 pm on 12-April-10. The ground was tested for pH and there was no need for remediation of the soil.,The facility unloading line and sump area drain line were repaired and the entire area has been concreted.

PAT TITUS,SAFETY & REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION,,,,,Facility,"Anhydrous ammonia — 2000 gal nurse tank release 4-6-2010 — Leverett Facility   Illini ES Safety & Regulatory Administrator, Pat Titus, was at the Leverett plant when a phone call from Gary “Rodney” White came in to Dave Jarvis, plant manager. White indicated he had been struck by a vehicle and the accident was at the intersection of Prospect & Hensley Rd. Dave Jarvis and Pat Titus went out to the accident scene. En route, Dave finds out from White that product is escaping and Rodney thought his thumb was broken. Titus calls in to Gala Alwood at the Urbana office to begin calling the three regulatory agencies. Titus phones Safety Mgr., John Warriner, (voicemail) and lets him know about the accident.   When Titus and Jarvis come on the scene of the accident, the road in front of Rodney was blocked off by the local township truck that was beyond the intersection about 130 feet. Jarvis and Titus are second on the scene and put the flashers on to slow traffic from the east. Titus checks with White to assess his injuries. He was upwind from the truck in the field and was holding his head. He indicated his injuries were his right thumb and some abrasions/redness on his left forearm. Titus asked if the redness was burning—he said “no.” White mentioned he could not open the driver’s door to get out. The other driver came over to ask White if he was okay. White sees a NH3 vapor cloud forming and tells driver to get clear of the area as he is carrying hazardous materials. White crawls out of the truck through the rolled-down window. Jarvis surveyed the accident scene where the truck was hit in the front and nosed down into the ditch. It remained upright whereas the NH3 tank was on its side covering the roadway. NH3 was still escaping at the front from a broken liquid valve. The other pickup truck is in the ditch as well. White indicated the other pickup truck barely stopped at the stop sign. White did not have a stop sign and had right of way. By the time White realized the other truck was coming into the Illini FS truck path, it was too late to stop truck & nurse tank. The truck, with the damage to the front, deployed both air bags. By now the Champaign County Sheriffs Department and the Thomasboro Fire Department are on the scene. White is transported to Carle Emergency Room for treatment by Arrow Ambulance. Safety Mgr. John Warriner and Asst. Operations Manager, Steve Dollins arrive. General Manager, Roger Read, arrives to the accident scene as well. The decision is made to try to transfer the product from the damaged tank via transfer pump to another tank. The   transfer pump hoses are not long enough to accommodate a tank with valves barely off the ground. Transfer is not attempted. The pickup truck is separated from the nurse tank. The decision is then made to have Road Ready use their crane lift to pull the nurse tank over, righting it back on all four wheels and then assess the scene. This process took about 1-1/2 hours.

Driver exited the tractor and alerted the occupants of the closest residence. Upon arrival of the fire Dept., it was determined that no product was leaking from the trailer. The fire dept. secured the scene and awaited arrival of Stallings Bros. (Carrier) and Eastern Emergency Management (Remediation Contractor for Carrier) personnel and equipment. Stallings Bros. and Eastern Emergency Management (EEM) personnel proceeded to drill and offload the product into another tanker, where it was accounted for and delivered to the original destination. The overturned unit was recovered and removed from the scene. EEM examined the roadside for contamination, and after finding none, restored the ground cover that was disturbed by this incident. Traffic on RP 1178 was diverted for approx. 6 Hrs., and all activity was concluded within the day.","This incident was caused by a combination of mechanical failure and inclement weather.
