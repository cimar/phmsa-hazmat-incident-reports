THE VEHICLE WAS FOUND TO BE PROPERLY SECURED. ENSLEY RETRIEVED THE KEYS FROM DISPATCH AND RETURNED TO THE TRUCK AND OPENED THE SIDE DOOR, THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK. THERE WAS ICE AND CONDENSATION AROUND THE VALVES AND UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK MOUNTED HL 190, CRYOGENIC CARGO TANK. HE IMMEDIATELY SECURED THE AREA AROUND THE TRUCK FROM VEHICLE AND PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC. AT APPROXIMATELY 0810 HOURS, 8-27-03, SHERIE HARMON, BRANCH MANAGER, ARRIVED AT THE OFFICE. SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY ADVISED OF THE SITUATION AND SHE CONTACTED THE DUNCAN FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED AND TAPED OFF THE AREA TO ALLOW FOR THE SAFE EVAPORATION OF THE LEAKING OXYGEN. FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL CONTACTED THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS DEPARTMENT. TONY BARNETT, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ADMINISTRATION RESPONDED. AT APPROXIMATELY 1030 HOURS, 8-27-03, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND MR. BARNETT DETERMINED THAT THE SITUATION WAS SAFE AND LEFT THE FACILITY. AT APPROXIMATELY 1100 HOURS, 8-27-03, AFTER THE ICE HAD COMPLETELY MELTED THE TANK WAS INSPECTED BY TRAVIS PARKER, LOGISTICS SUPERVISOR. ALL COMPONENTS WERE FOUND TO BE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. THE SECONDARY FILL VALVE WAS FOUND TO BE SLIGHTLY OPEN, BUT WAS FOUND TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. FURTHER INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT AN UNSECURED DOLLY HAD BEEN FOUND SITTING ADJACENT TO THE VALVE. AS TRUCK HAD BEEN SECURED SINCE IT WAS LAST OPERATED, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE UNSECURED DOLLY MAY HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH THE VALVE DURING TRANSPORT, CAUSING THE VALVE TO BE PARTIALLY OPENED RESULTING IN A SLOW RELEASE OF THE OXYGEN. THE DRIVER WHO PARKED THE TRUCK WAS, THOMAS LAWSON, AN APRIA HEALTHCARE CLINICAL SERVICE TECHNICIAN. LAWSON IS A 5+ YEAR EMPLOYEE WITH A CLASS B CDL WITH HAZMAT AND TANK ENDORSEMENTS. HE RECEIVED HIS LAST HAZMAT TRAINING VERIFICATION ON 3-6-01. LAWSON ADVISED THAT AFTER HE PARKED THE TRUCK ON 8-26-03 HE HAD CHECKED THE DOOR TO VERIFY THAT IT WAS LOCKED.

IBC 181340 REPRESENTED ONE OF FIVE IBCS ON BOARD VAN TRAILER 71806. UPON VISUAL INSPECTION, THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE LEAK WAS DIFFICULT TO DETECT. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY APPARENT DAMAGE. MOREOVER, ALL THE OTHER MATERIALS ON BOARD APPEARED TO BE INTACT BASED ON DELIVERY TICKET 24304130. THESE MATERIALS INCLUDED 30 AMMONIA CYLINDERS, 18 EMPTY DELDRUMS, 12 PHOSPHORIC ACID DRUMS, 1 NITRIC ACID DRUM, AND A PAINT DRUM. OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL AND INCIDENT COMMAND ON THE SCENE MADE THE DECISION TO TRANSFER THE MATERIAL TO ANOTHER IBC. THE IBC WITH THE BAD VALVE WOULD BE TRANSPORTED TO OUR ST ALBANS BRANCH AND THEN RETURNED TO HENDERSON FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. CAUSE: OUR ST.ALBANS BRANCH SHIPPER IBC 181340 BACK TO THE HENDERSON FACILITY. BILL WILSON JR., ACID DEPT. SUPERVISOR, FILLED THE IBC WITH WATER AND PRESSURIZED THE TANK. HE PINPOINTED THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE LEAK AT THE TOP BACK PORTION OF THE VALVE ASSEMBLY. ON 8/28/03, BILL DISMANTLED THE VALVE. IT WAS VERY EVIDENT THAT THE GASKET HAD DETERIORATED. THEREFORE WE ATTRIBUTE THE ROOT CAUSE TO THE AGE AND FATIGUE OF THE GASKET. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR RELATES TO THE MULTI-PIECE CONSTRUCTION OF THE VALVE THAT IS HELD TOGETHER BY A SIX-BOLT ASSEMBLY. WE COUNTED 6 POSSIBLE PLACED WHERE THE VALVE COULD POSSIBLE DEVELOP A LEAK. ACTION TAKEN TO PREVENT FUTURE INCIDENTS: THE IBC 181340 WILL BE FITTED WITH A NEWER STYLE VALVE THAT IS A 4-BOLT ASSEMBLY AND ONLY 2-PIECE CONSTRUCTION INCLUDING A PVC VALVE STEM THAT IS MORE CORROSION RESISTANT. OUR DISTRICT OPERATIONS MANAGER, ANDY CLEMENTS, STATED THAT EFFECTIVE 8/28/03, WE WILL REPLACE THE SIX-BOLT VALVE ASSEMBLY WITH THE NEW REPLACEMENT VALVE ON ALL IBCS AS THEY ARE BEING FILLED. DUE TO THE AGE OF THE IBCS IN SERVICE THAT THE 6-BOLT VALVE, THIS WILL SERVE TO PREVENT THE POTENTIAL FOR ANY FUTURE LEAKS OF THIS NATURE. WE HAD ALREADY IMPLEMENTED MEASURES TO REPLACE THE 6-BOLT MULTI-PIECE VALVES ON IBCS DEDICATED FOR HYDROCHLORIC ACID SERVICE WITH THE 4-BOLT VALVE 2-PIECE CONSTRUCTION. THE NEWER VALVES HAVE HELPED TO ELIMINATE PROBLEMS WITH CORROSION OF METALLIC PARTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAD ALREADY IMPLEMENTED CONTROLS FOR PURCHASING NEW IBCS FITTED WITH NEWER VALVE CONSTRUCTION AS PREVENTIVE MEASURES. SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXAMINE THE INTEGRITY OF THE GASKET UNLESS YOU REMOVE THE VALVE AND COMPLETELY DISMANTLE THE COMPONENTS, WE FEEL IT WILL BE MORE COST-EFFECTIVE IN LONG RUN TO REPLACE THE 6-BOLT VALVE ON ALL IBCS AS THEY ARE FILLED AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE AND ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL RISK OF ANOTHER GASKET FAILURE ON THE OLDER VALVES CURRENTLY IN SERVICE.",,No,IBC,Plastic receptacle for liquids,31H,Yes,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5959,,US,

ON 08/20/03 AT 1517 A LIQUID SPILL WITH A GLUE ODOR WAS REPORTED IN THE SORT AREA OF OUR BTV (OUTBASE STATION) SORTING FACILITY LOCATED AT AIRBORNE EXPRESS, 391 BOYER CIRCLE, WILLISTON, VT 06495.  AT THE TIME OF THE CALL, THE SHIPMENT HAD BEEN PLACED IN TWO PLASTIC BAGS WITH ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND THE AFFECTED AREA HAD BEEN CLEANED.  WE SENT A SALVAGE DRUM TO RECOVER THIS SHIPMENT SO WE COULD COMPLETE THE NECESSARY INVESTIGATION AND 5800.1 REPORT. ONCE WE RECEIVED THE DRUMMED SHIPMENT PART TIME SPILL TECHNICIAN CAROLYN FRYE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIAL COORDINATOR BRUCE SHILTZ DONNED PROPER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND STARTED THEIR INVESTIGATION.  UPON THIS INVESTIGATION THEY FOUND THE FIBERBOARD BOX INSIDE THE DRUM TO CONTAIN 1 X 4 OF ""ADHESIVES, 3, UN 1133, PG II"" IN A METAL CAN WITH A SCREW TYPE CLOSURE.  THE CLOSURE ON THIS CAN WAS NOT SECURED BY POSITIVE MEANS. THE CLOSURE ON THIS CAN CAME LOOSE ALLOWING IT TO LEAK ITS ENTIRE CONTENTS OF 4 L. THIS SHIPMENT WAS PROPERLY MARKED AND LABELED AND HAD THE PROPER SHIPPER'S DECLARATION FOR DANGEROUS GOODS ATTACHED TO IT TO INDICATE THAT THE CONTENTS WERE A REGULATED HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. THEY REPLACED THE ITEMS BACK INTO THE BOX, SEALED AND BAGGED THE SHIPMENT IN THE TWO PLASTIC BAGS WITH ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND PLACED IT INTO A SALVAGE DRUM.  THIS SHIPMENT WAS FORWARDED ONTO ITS DESTINATION. THERE WERE TWO EMPLOYEES IN CONTACT WITH THE ODOR AT THE BTV STATION.  THEY WERE ADVISED WHAT THE ODOR WAS AND RETURNED TO THEIR WORK AREAS.  NO MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS NEEDED.  NO FURTHER FOLLOW UP NEEDED.  THERE ARE PICTURES ON FILE IN THE HAZ MAT OFFICE IN WILMINGTON, OHIO.
