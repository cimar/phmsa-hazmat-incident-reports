The car was isolated and the Shipper, Bridger Trading, LLC, was notified via CHEMTREC, report 2014-09-03-00161. A CSX Emergency Response contractor, EP+S of Vermont the Buffalo Branch office was dispatched to the scene, upon inspection it was determined that manway cover swing bolts #6+7 were less than tool tight, this causing a release between the manway cover and the nozzle, during the securement of the manway swing bolts, a broken support ear was found on the #3 swing bolt which supports the retainer pin for proper closure of the manway cover.  Mr. Paul Ferguson, Rail Logistics Manager,was notified of the situation found. ACFX 71284 will be a transload, then cleaned + purged for Home Shop disposition.

Containment was placed under BNSF 880294 to capture leaking liquid. BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders inspecting BNSF 880294 reported the top operated bottom outlet valve's (TOBOV) operating rod was approximately four turns loose from its full closed position. Responders closed the TOBOV and the leak at the bottom outlet slowed but continued. The bottom outlet's closure cap (BOC) was tight. BNSF 880294 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard with portable containment in place under its bottom outlet.  On 9/02/2014 the commodity within BNSF 880294 was transferred into another suitable tank car without further incident and afterwards the commodity drips from the BOC ceased. The BOC was removed and inspected. The BOC gasket was found deteriorated/warped which allowed commodity to escape at this non-sealing BOC and from the non-closing TOBOV. The gasket was replaced and the BOC was properly tool tightened. Impacted ballast/soils were excavated and transported to a disposal facility. The excavation sites were backfilled with clean soil and ballast. Captured commodity was taken to a recycling facility. BNSF 880294 was directed to a qualified repair facility to determine and rectify the TOBOV's failure to fully close.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,13100,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The tanker had 3 domes on the top where different connections could be made. The front dome was used to connect the TOx vent line and the middle and rear domes were not used. The middle and rear dome connections were not inspected prior to the tanker leaving. The vent line inside the rear dome was loose  and material began leaking during transitfrom that vent line. The tanker was observed  leaking by Valley City contractors and they stopped the tanker at the corner of Romence Rd and Portage Rd. This is a very short distance (1/4 mile) from where it left the Pfizer site. The splill occurred from the Pfizer  site to this location. Material that was spilled in that distance was cleaned up by Valley City Environmental Services, the 1 rear vent line where the leak occurred was tightened and the tanker was returned to the Pfizer site for inspection before being released for shipment.",The following corrective actions are being taken to prevent any future re occurence.    1. The loading and inspection procedure will be updated to incorporate additional inspection requirements to include all vent lines.  2.

While he was moving from one area of the site to another he forgot to disengage the PTO, resulting in an excess of pressure provoked by the continuous pumping of diesel. Given the excess presure that the hoses were subject to, the hose that connects the pump with the delivery system failed. Resulting in a spill of about 90 gallons of diesel on the 123 Road.  This spill also afected the entrance to the Cemex cement plant located nearby. The pump spilled liquid for about 20 seconds. Inmediately when the driver realized the situation he stopped the flow of the pump and made sure there was no more leakage. He proceeded to put absorbent pads in the area of the spill. We called 911 to get police and fire rescue personnel to the area. Then we called our environmental cleanup company to proceed with the first response. Our mechanics also where inmediately dispatched to the area.  We sent a different truck as a precaution to unload the hole amount contained in the truck involved in the spill. FMCSA inspectors arrived to the scene. They supervised the cleanup procedures and the unloading of the tank. Around 3pm the cleanup was finished.",We suspended the driver for two weeks for the safety incident.  As an SOP or standard operating procedure exists all employees will be reminded of the importance of making things right.  We are contemplating feasible ways to make the truck unmovable when the PTO is engaged. Training will be conducted ASAP in regards to this incident as a learning experience for all our drivers and personnel.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6315,BVI Gas Inc dba Cabo Rojo Gas & Oil,US,

All concerned were notified. KCS dispatched a hazmat responder. Upon arrival the responder positioned containment under the BOV, and then determined that the top operated BOV was open.  The responder turned the valve four turns and then applied a 24"" pipe wrench to close the valve tool tight.  The responder found the 6"" cap loose and inside a defective gasket  The gasket was replaced, then the cap returned and tightened tool tight.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

All concerned were notified. KCS dispatched a hazmat responder. Upon arrival the responder determined that the all eight manway bolts were not tool tight (finger tight only) and that the manway gasket was missing. The responder installed a new gasket on the dome, closed the manway, and tightened the manway bolts tool tight.  The responder then wiped down the sides of the tank car with pads.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

SRIX 33815 was cordoned-off in the railyard and yard operations were subsequently suspended. Contract responders inspecting SRIX 33815 determined the commodity odor/vapor was emanating from the top style Midland 280.5 psi pressure relief valve's (PRV) bolted connection to the tank cars pressure plate and from the PRV's top cap area.  An emergency response kit (Midland Capping Kit) was applied over the PRV to seal off escaping commodity vapor/odor by 0700 CDT, 9/08/2014. Afterwards, SRIX 33815 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard awaiting commodity transfer.  On 9/16/2014, contract responders transferred commodity within SRIX 33815 to another suitable tank car which was accomplished without incident by 1630 hrs. CDT, 9/16/2014. Air monitoring was initiated before and throughout the transfer process with no detectable levels of ammonia recorded. Afterwards, responders removed the applied Midland Capping mechanism and tool tightened the PRV flange bolt nuts (approximately two turns each). In addition, the PRV's O-rings were removed and replaced. The removed O-rings appeared to have signs of chemical degradation and flattening (compression set). The removed O-rings were sent to Carolina Seal for root cause failure analysis. After the PRV was secure, no commodity odor or vapor release was detectable. Responders re-inspected SRIX 33815 in the morning of 9/17/2014 and no commodity vapor leakage or odor was detected.",No additional comments.,Yes,TANK CAR,,112J340W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,40000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

When the operators were pressurizing the tanker to prepare for the transfer they noticed a leak from the tanker relief valve. This was at ~ 9:00 am. We were not sure if the release occurred from the valve or from a gasket on the pressure relief device.  Unloading could not occur with the leaking pressure relief device. It was determined the best course of action was to move the tanker away from the storage tanks to a remote location on Pfizer property. That movement occurred at ~ 12:00 pm.  That required traffic to be stopped for less than 1 hour near the site to allow safe movement of the tanker to the remote location. The supplier was contacted and brought a new valve from Chicago, but they contract Valley City to swap the valves out. The supplier did not do the work themselves. The repair was completed ~5:30 pm that same day. The truck was inspected after the valve change out, and a 7 psi nitrogen pad was added to the tanker before leaving the site at ~ 8:00 pm.",The Supplier and Transport Company will need to address the maintenence on the tanker trucks before they deliver product to the customer to ensure there is no malfunction of their equipment.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,30,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,0,Pfizer Inc.,US,

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the transfer operation, it was discovered two drums had been double stacked and leaning to one side.  The compromised drum had begun to leak and when removing the 2-drum pallet, the leaning drum fell causing the top to rupture resulting in material escaping from the drum to the van trailer floor and subsequently to an area of containment below the van trailer.   Facility personnel assembled a response team who proceeded to place the compromised  container into a suitable salvage drum. In addition, all clean-up debris and materials used to decontaminate the floor of the trailer were collected and  placed into the salvage drum. Once complete, the container was secured and was placed onto the trailer for continued transportation.","Management Team Investigation was conducted and the conclusion is this was a driver error.  Along with a  write-up to the driver, retraining is required with clear instruction that when drums of liquid are double stacked on trailer, the base must be wide and strong enough to support the material and the material must be secure from movement in all directions; and straps or load locks are to be used so as to ensure no movement.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Removable head plastic drum,1H2,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc",US,

The local Klamath-Lake Hazmat Response Team responded and reported finding both liquid valves and the vapor valve within the valve housing area not secured with liquid commodity emanating from one of the liquid valves. All valves were reported to be 1/2 to 3/4 turns from full closure. One liquid valve with a loose closure plug was leaking liquid commodity from the plug's orifice. The vapor valve with a loose closure plug was leaking vapors from the plug's orifice as well. The Hazmat Response Team closed all the valves and tightened the loose closure plugs which ended any further release of commodity. All spillage evaporated.  Response was concluded by 1430 hrs.

BNSF and contract responders inspecting PROX 44085 reported finding the applied manway nozzle gasket deteriorated and partially torn; thusly not providing a good seal. A new manway nozzle gasket was installed and the manway cover was re-secured which ended the commodity odor/vapor release. No liquid commodity release was observed, but a very small dried residue stain near the manway nozzle was wiped.  All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure.

The safety and environmental departments were immediately notified. The acid that leaked onto the ground was neutralized with soda ash. The car was immediately tagged out of service. On further inspection the car was noted to have two loose bolts that were less than finger tight that fasten top liquid valve to top valve plate.
