ONE OF TH MADIX EMPLOYEES (ENRIQUE GUTIERREZ OF THE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT) REPORTED TO ME THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE DRUM LEAKING ON A PST TRUCK THAT HAD PULLED UP TO OUR DOCK TO BE UNLOADED.  THE DRIVER PULLED OUT OF THE WAY SO WE COULD USE THE DOCK.  I GOT IN MY CAR AND DROVE TO THE SITE. IN ADDITION OT THE CONTAMINATION INSIDE AN DON THE PST TRAILER, THERE WERE 3 AREAS OF CONTAMINATION OF MADIX PROPERTY.  ONE WHERE HE HAD ORIGINALLY PULLED UP ON CONCRETE, ONE WHERE HE PULLED OUT OF THE WAY ONTO A WHITE ROCK AND DIRT PARKING AREA, AND ONE WHERE HE REDOCKED TO UNLOAD (IT WAS ON CONCRETE, BUT IN A DIFFERENT PLACE).  THE SPILLED MATERIAL WAS A PAINT MANUFACTURED AND SHIPPED BY SPRAYLAT.  THEIR PRODUCT CODE FOR IT IS J2058.  IT IS A HIGH SOLIDS BAKING ENAMEL.  A FULL DRUM WEIGHED 654 POUNDS, AND THIS DRUM, AFTER WE INVERTED IT TO STOP THE LEAK, WEIGHED 618 POUNDS.  NO OTHER DRUMS WERE FOUND TO BE LEAKING.  THIS MEANS 36 POUNDS OF PAINT WAS LEAKED INTO THE TRAILER, AND SOME OF IT FOUND ITS WAY OUT THE DOOR.  IT MADE A MESS MUCH BIGGER THAN 36 POUNDS WOULD SUGGEST.  THERE WAS A PAINT PUDDLE THE WIDTH OF THE TRAILER AND ABOUT 6 FEET UP THE LENGTH OF THE TRAILER ON THE INSIDE, AND PAINT HAD LEAKED DOW THE TRAILER STRUCTURE ONTO THE GROUND.  A DRUM, MARKED ""1A2/Y1.2/100 USA/R1286/97/RL"" WAS FOUND TO BE LEAKING IN TWO PLACES ON THE BOTTOM STEEL PLATE (NOT AT THE SEAMS).  I COULD NOT FIND ANY FURTHER MANUFACTURER OR RECONDITIONER INFORMATION ON THE DRUM.  THE BOTTOM PLATE APPEARED TO CREASED IN A STRAIGHT LINE AS IF SOMETHING HAD PUSHED UP ON THE MIDDLE OF THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM PLATED OF THE DRUM. PICTURES OF THE DRUM ACCOMPANY THIS REPORT.  THE PALLET UNDER THE DRUM ALSO HAD A BROKEN BOARD IN THE CORRESPONDING LOCATION. WE PUT TWO MADIX EMPLOYEES TO WORK STOPPING THE LEAK AND CLEANING UP THE MADIX PROPERTY MENTIONED ABOVE.  I THEN CALLED PST AT (800)535-0544 AND GOT ANDREW DEMETROPOULOS, CLAIMS MANAGER.  I REPORTED THE SITUATION TO HIM.  HE AGREED TO FOOT THE BILL FOR CLEANUP, AND REFERRED ME TO YOU.  AS OF NOW ALL HAS BEEN CLEANED UP EXCEPT FOR THE CONTAMINATION ON THE WHITE ROCK AND DIRT PARKING LOT.  WE ARE WAITING FOR A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO GET THAT DONE.  IT SHOULD BE TAKEN CAR OF TODAY.  WASTE MATERIALS HAVE BEEN PLACED IN DRUMS, SEALED UP, AND STORED WITH SIMILAR WASTE MATERIALS GENERATED ROUTINELY AT MADIX.  MADIX WILL SHIP THESE MATERIALS OUT WITH THE NEXT WASTE SHIPMENT. THE  TRAILER WAS CLEANED UP UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MICHAEL BOBO AND HARVEY CHITTY, WHO BOTH ARE 40-HOUR HAZWOPER TRAINED AND DOT HAZMAT TRAINED.  BOTH HAVE CLASS A CDL'S WITH HAZMAT AND TANKER ENDORSEMENT (ENDORSEMENT X).  SPILLED MATERIAL WAS REMOVED FROM THE TRAILER AND THE CONTAMINATED PLACES WERE WIPED DOWN WITH RAGS AND SMALL AMOUNTS OF SOLVENT.

THE RUST DRIVER HAD BEEN ASSIGNED THE TASK  OF TRANSFERRING API/DAF SLUDGE FROM TOSCO WILMINGTON TO TOSCO CARSON. UPON ARRIVING AT THE DESTINATION, THE GUARD AT THE ATE ADVISED THE DRIVER THAT THE BACK OF HIS TRUCK WAS WET. THIS LED BOTH PARTIES TO BELIEVE THAT DURING TRANSPORTATION AN UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF PRODUCT HAD OCCURRED THROUGH A REAR PIPE IN THE TRAILER THAT HAD A CAM-LOCK CAP MISSING. THE GUARD NOTIFIED TOSCO OFFICIALS AND THE DRIVER NOTIFIED RUST OFFICIALS. THE TRUCK ROUTE FROM WILMINGTON TO CARSON HAD BEEN INSPECTED FOR ANY EVIDENCE OF THE SPILLED MATERIALS. THIS ROUTE WAS TRAVELED BY BOTH TRANSPORTER OFFICIALS AND EVIDENCE OF ANY SPILLED MATERIAL WAS NOT OBSERVE.

MAYO PROCEEDED NORTHBOUND ON I-25 ENROUTE TO COLORADO SPRINGS AFTER DEPARTING ASHLAND'S FACILITY IN PUEBLO. AT THE 107 MILE MARKER (MM) MAYO DROVE OVER A LARGE PATCH OF ICE (APPROXIMATELY 40 FT) UNDER A RAILROAD OVERPASS. THE PAVEMENT WAS DRY PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE AREA UNDER THE OVERPASS.  AFTER PROCEEDING UNDER THE OVERPASS MAYO ENCOUNTERED A SCENE WHERE A PASSENGER CAR HAD SPUNOUT AND CAME TO REST IN THE MEDIAN BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTHBOUND LANES OF I-25. FROM FACTS DERIVED FROM WITNESS STATEMENTS MAYO DROVE OVER THE PATCH OF ICE AND LOST CONTROL. MAYO'S TRAILER STARTED SPINNING TO HIS RIGHT, TURNED 180 DEGREES AND ENTERED THE MEDIAN TRAILER REAR FIRST IN THE SAME AREA AS THE CAR. DUE TO A STEEP EMBANKMENT FROM THE SHOULDER TO THE BOTTOM OF THE MEDIAN AREA THE TRAILER OVERTURNED, WHICH IN TURN CAUSED THE TRACTOR TO OVERTURN. A DIAGRAM FROM THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER FROM THE COLORADO STATE PATROL IS ATTACHED. DUE TO THE FORCES OF THE OVERTURN ACCIDENT PRODUCTS IN THE TRAILER WERE THROWN ABOUT AND CRUSHED. APPROXIMATELY 15 GALLONS LEAKED FROM ONE 55 GALLON POLY RUBBER DRUM OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE (UN 2014). APPROXIMATELY .5 GALLONS LEAKED FROM A POLY BOTTLE OF SULFURIC ACID (UN 1830). APPROXIMATELY .5 GALLONS OF ETHANOLAMINE SOLUTION (UN2491) LEAKED FROM A POLY BOTTLE. FINALLY, APPROXIMATELY 10-15 GALLONS OF #2 DIESEL LEAKED FROM THE RIGHT FUEL TANK OF THE TRACTOR. DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF SNOW REMAINING IN THE MEDIAN AND THE MINIMAL AMOUNTS OF LEAKAGE FROM ALL CONTAINERS NO PRODUCT OR SOIL WAS REMOVED FROM THE ACCIDENT SCENE AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT. HOWEVER, THE COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS NOT CLOSED THE FILE; THE NEED FOR SCENE RESTORATION COULD STILL OCCUR.  OFFICER PULVER OF THE COLORADO STATE PATROL AND DEPUTY BLACKBURN OF THE PUEBLO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE WERE EXPOSED TO THE SULFURIC ACID FUMES. BOTH WERE ADMITTED TO ST.

DRIVER'S INFO IS AS FOLLOWS: ROY ALLAN CUMMINGS - EMPLOYED BY DIXON BROS. APPROXIMATELY 5 YEARS AS DRIVER 217 4TH AVENUE NEWCASTLE, WY 746-3311 - HOME PHONE 746-2788 - DIXON BROS. DISPATCH PHONE. TOM MCGRATH MET BILL PEDERSEN & LARRY OLSON AT THE IN-PIT FUEL ISLAND. THEY OBSERVED THE LARGE ""LAY DOWN"" TANK ON THE NORTH END OF THE FUEL COMPOUND HAD THE EAST END OF SAID TANK PEELED BACK FROM THE MAIN TANK BODY; THE WELD ALONG THE NORTH EDGE SEPARATED AND THE WELD ALONG THE SOUTH EDGE REMAINED INTACT. APPROXIMATELY 95% OF THE SPILLED FUEL WAS CONTAINED IN THE CONTAINMENT AREA. HOWEVER DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE RUPTURE, THE POSITION OF THE TANK AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THE END SPLIT FROM THE TANK BODY, THE MAIN FLOW OF FUEL WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE CONTAINMENT BERM, AND SOME FUEL DID SPLASH OVER THE BERM ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE. THIS FUEL STARTED TO RUM DOWN A DRAINAGE AREA. THE SPILL FUEL WAS BLOCKED OFF USING THE 117 LOADER TO DUMP SEVERAL LOADS OF DIRT AHEAD OF THE SPILL. THE AREA WAS CONED OFF. TOM MCGRATH CALLED CHRIS ZAVADA (ELECTRICIAN ON DUTY) AND HAD HER DISCONNECT ALL POWER TO THE FUEL STORAGE AREA. KISSACK WATER SERVICE WAS CONTACTED TO SEND OUT SEVERAL VAC TRUCKS TO START EVACUATING THE LIQUID INSIDE THE CONTAINMENT AREA BEFORE IT SOAKED INTO THE GROUND. STEVE STORIE, CRAIG JENNINGS, STEVE BURCHETT AND JACK LAAKSO WERE NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT. MR. CUMMINGS NOTIFIED DIXON BROS. DISPATCH OF THE INCIDENT AS WELL. AFTER AN INITIAL INVESTIGATION, IT IS ESTIMATED APPROXIMATELY 1,500 GALLONS OF FUEL SPLASHED OUTSIDE THE CONTAINMENT AREA. MR. CUMMINGS STATED THE TANK HAD APPROXIMATELY 9' (13,613 GALLONS) SHOW ON THE GAUGE PRIOR TO HIM BEGINNING TO OFF-LOAD FUEL. HE ALSO STATED THE TANK SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT FULL AT THE TIME OF THE RUPTURE. THE FUEL DELIVERY TICKET FOR 10-21-97 SHOWED 11,001 GALLONS BEING DELIVERED TO THE MINE SITE. BY CALCULATING OUT THE BEFORE AND AFTER TANK LEVELS AT THE MAIN TANK FARM NEAR THE SHOP, THE DRIVER APPARENTLY OFF-LOADED 9.959 GALLONS OF FUEL INTO THE MAIN TANK FARM.

MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE ICTF FACILITY AND LOCATED THE CONTAINER ACTUALLY SITTING IN THE EAST ROADWAY ALONG TRACK #805. THE REAR OF THE 20 FOOT CONTAINER WAS RESTING ON THE PAVEMENT, WITH THE FORWARD PORTION STILL ON THE CHASSIS. THE FRONT PORTION OF THE CHASSIS WAS STILL ATTACHED TO A STREET TRACTOR OPERATED BY MR. MENDOZA, WHO WAS DRIVING FOR MSL. INSPECTION DEVELOPED THE CHASSIS TO DISTRIBUTE THE WEIGHT OVER HIS AXLES PRIOR TO DEPARTING THE FACILITY. IN THE PROCESS OF LOCKING THE CHASSIS BRAKES, AND PULLING FORWARD TO STRETCH THE FRAME LOCKING PINS BYPASSED THE FORWARD PORT OPENINGS AND TORE THE STOP PLATES OFF, ALLOWING THE CHASSIS TO COME APART AND THE CONTAINER TO DROP TO THE PAVEMENT. THIS SEPARATION APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY OVER SPEED AND DRIVER NOT PAYING ATTENTION. THE CONTAINER IMPACTING THE PAVEMENT CAUSED THE LADING OF 55 GALLON DRUMS TO LEAK, AND APPROXIMATELY 50-60 GALLONS OF METHANOL HAD BEEN RELEASED THROUGH THE REAR DOORS ONTO THE PAVEMENT. THE LIQUID WAS DIKED AND CONTAINED, THEN DILUTED WITH WATER TO SUPPRESS THE VAPORS. THE AREA WAS THEN COVERED WITH ABSORBENT AND SWEPT UP FOR CONTAINMENT IN DRUMS. THE CONTAINER WAS PICKED UP AND PLACED ONTO A NEW CHASSIS AND MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK FOR INSPECTION. UPON OPENING THE CONTAINER, OBSERVED METAL 55 GALLON DRUMS, BANDED TO PALLETS, AND DOUBLE STACKED THROUGHOUT THE CONTAINER. TY-PATCH MATERIAL WAS USED TO SECURE THE LADING AND APPEARED TO BE PROPERLY APPLIED. THE FLOOR LOADED DRUMS HAD SUSTAINED HEAVY DAMAGE FROM THE IMPACT AND THE ADDITIONAL WEIGHT OF THE SECOND TIER DRUMS. IN ORDER TO INSPECT THE DRUMS AND LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK, THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE CONTAINER REQUIRED REMOVAL. DURING THE REMOVAL PROCESS, LOCATED ONE DRUM ON THE FLOOR STACK, SECOND FROM THE RIGHT SIDE, IN THE FIRST ROW AT THE DOORWAY, THAT WAS SEVERALLY DISTORTED AT THE BOTTOM CHIME, ALLOWING AN EIGHT INCH SEPARATION BETWEEN THE BOTTOM OF THE DRUM AND THE CHIME. THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE DRUM HAD BEEN LOST. IN ALL, A TOTAL OF 35 ADDITIONAL DRUMS WERE INSPECTED AND FOUND TO BE UNFIT FOR FURTHER TRANSPORTATION. ALL WERE PLACED INTO OVER PACKS FOR SECUREMENT. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH THE MANUFACTURER TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED DRUMS, AND THE CONTAINER WAS RELOADED FOR MOVEMENT ONTO THE CONSIGNEE.
