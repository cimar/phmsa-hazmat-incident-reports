THE CONTAINER WAS MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK WHERE IT COULD BE SECURED AND ISOLATED PENDING INSPECTION.  UPON OPENING THE REAR DOORS, NOTED FOUR EACH 2X6 PIECES OF LUMBER IN A HORIZONTAL POSITION, SET TO THE REAR BULL SLOTS.  TOW LARGE DID BAGS HAD BEEN PLACED DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE BULL BOARDS AND THE DOUBLE STACKED DRUMS.  THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDED PROTOCOL, NOR IS IT AN APPROVED METHOD PER THE BOE 6C FOR THE PROPER SECUREMENT OF HAZARDOUS COMMODITIES TRANSPORTED BY RAIL.  AFTER IDENTIFYING MOL AS THE SHIPPER OF RECORD ON THE RAIL BILLING, IT WAS DECIDED TO HAVE THE UNIT SIT TILL MORNING WHEN THE MOL CHICAGO OFFICE WOULD BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS.  CONTACT WAS MADE WITH MOL, WHO REQUESTED THE CONTAINER BE INSPECTED.  DEVELOPED THROUGH THE MARINE SURVEYOR THAT THE LOAD BELONGED TO GOLDSCHMIDT CHEMICAL, POINT OF ORIGIN HAD NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED AT THIS STAGE.  LATER IN THE AFTERNOON, TEC ADVISED MOL HAD GIVEN THEM A VERBAL AUTHORIZATION TO REWORK THE CONTAINER.  THE FOLLOWING MORNING, THURSDAY, 9-14-00, THE LADING WAS REMOVED AND INSPECTED FOR LEAKS.  WHILE IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING THE LADING, MOL'S SURVEYOR PRODUCED AN E-MAIL DOCUMENT FROM GOLDSCHMIDT CHEMICAL IDENTIFYING THE REPRESENTATIVE THAT AUTHORIZED THE REWORK.  AFTER DISCUSSING THE CONDITION OF THE LADING AND THE METHOD OF SECUREMENT, TEC WAS PUT IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH GOLDSCHMIDT.  AS THE DRUMS WERE BEING OFF LOADED, LOCATED ONE DRUM IN THE TOP TIER, FIVE ROWS FROM THE NOSE, SECOND OUT FROM THE LEFT SIDE WALL, TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  THE BOTTOM ROLLING HOOP HAD BEEN IMPACTED, CAUSING A SMALL 'V' INDENTATION AND CRACK IN THE ROLLING HOOP.    PRODUCT WAS ACTIVELY LEAKING FROM THE DRUM AS IT WAS MOVED.  THE DRUM WAS PATCHED AND PLACED INTO AN OVER PACK FOR SECUREMENT.  IT APPEARS THIS DRUM SUSTAINED THE DAMAGE PRIOR TO OR DURING THE LOADING PROCESS, AS THIS TYPE OF IMPACT TO THE DRUM IS NOT NORMALLY FOUND IF ABRADING AGAINST AN ADJACENT DRUM DURING TRANSIT.  FOUR ADDITIONAL DRUMS WERE LOCATED WITH SUFFICIENT DAMAGE TO WARRANT THEM UNFIT FOR FURTHER MOVEMENT.  THE FLOORING WAS CLEANED OF THE RESIDUE, AND THE REMAINING DRUMS WERE RELOADED INTO THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER.

COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY WAS CONTACTED BY ICTF SECURITY REPORTING A LEAKING CONTAINER. MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE ICTF, LOCATED THE ABOVE CONTAINER IN ROW E-5, SPACE 199, AND OBSERVED A SMALL AMOUNT OF DRIED PRODUCT AT THE RIGHT REAR CORNER OF THE CONTAINER. LESS THAN 1 PINT OF PRODUCT HAD WEPT THROUGH THE REAR DOOR GASKET AND POOLED ONTO THE REAR PLATFORM OF THE CHASSIS. THE CONTAINER WAS MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK WHERE IT COULD CONTAINED AND ISOLATED. UPON OPENING THE REAR DOORS OF THE CONTAINER, NOTED THE LADING TO BE 55 GALLON DRUMS, DOUBLE STACKED, AND SECURED WITH TY-PATCH. THE 4 STRIPS OF TY-PATCH WERE LOOSE AND THE FABRIC HAD SHIFTED DOWN. IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE DRUMS WERE THE NEWER TYPE WITH THE INVERTED SIDE WALL ROLLING HOOPS. PLYWOOD HAD BEEN USED FOR THE BI LEVEL SEPARATION, AND IT WAS NOTED THAT ALL THE SHEETS HAD BEEN CUT SHORT. INSTEAD OF REACHING FROM SIDE WALL TO WALL, THE PLYWOOD HAD BEEN SHORT CUT ON THE AVERAGE 6-8 INCHES. WITH THE GAP BETWEEN THE END OF THE PLYWOOD AND THE CONTAINER SIDE WALL, THERE WAS NO CONTINUOUS FLAT SURFACE FOR THE TOP TIER DRUMS TO REST ON, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE DRUMS TO ROCK AND MOVE WHILE IN TRANSIT. THIS COULD ACCOUNT FOR THE LOOSE TY-PATCH CONDITION AT THE REAR OF THE LOAD. IN ORDER TO LOCATE THE LEAKING DRUM, THE LADING WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED. UPON CONTACTING THE SHIPPER, DEGUSSA-HULS, ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO REMOVE AND INSPECT THE LADING. DEGUSSA HAD THEIR LOCAL CONTRACTOR, ECOLOGY CONTROL,  RESPOND AND PROVIDE THE PERSONNEL TO COMPLETE THE WORK. ONE DRUM WAS LOCATED ON THE TOP STACK, MID SHIP THAT APPEARED TO BE THE LEAKER. CLOSER INSPECTION DEVELOPED THE DRUM HAD A SMALL ONE INCH GROOVE, SIMILAR TO A KNIFE CUT, IN THE SIDE WALL, LOCATED JUST ABOVE THE BOTTOM CHIME. THE GROOVE APPEARED TO BE A PAINT SCRAPE AND WAS NOT LEAKING AT THE TIME IT WAS REMOVED. IT APPEARS THIS DAMAGE WAS DONE PRIOR TO, OR DURING THE LOADING PROCESS. IT IS SUSPECTED THE DRUM WAS 'NICKED' WITH THE CORNER OF A DRUM GRAPPLER ATTACHED TO A FORK LIFT. WHEN THE PRODUCT WEPT FROM THE SIDE WALL GROOVE,  IT CREATED A VACUUM IN THE DRUM THAT HELD THE PRODUCT UNTIL THE LIQUID WAS DISTURBED BY MOTION. UPON FLIPPING THE DRUM OVER AIR WA SUCKED BACK INTO THE DRUM. THE DRUM WAS PATCHED AND PLACE INTO AN OVERPACK FOR SECUREMENT. THE CONTAINER SURFACE AREAS AND REMAINING DRUMS WERE CLEANED OF THE RESIDUE, AND THE LADING PLACED BACK INTO THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER. THE CONTAINER WAS THEN RELEASED FOR MOVEMENT ONTO THE CONSIGNEE.

THE RQ FOR THIS PRODUCT IS 1,000 POUNDS WHICH EQUALS APPROXIMATELY 64.5 GALLONS. FORTUNATELY, THE PRODUCT WAS RELEASED INTO A CONTAINMENT SYSTEM SO IT IS CONSIDERED A CONTROLLED SPILL AND NO DOT 5800.1 MUST BE GENERATED. THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE TO EQUIPMENT REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT. THE HOSE WAS REPLACED AND THE REMAINING PRODUCT WAS UNLOADED WITHOUT INCIDENT. AS A MATTER OF POLICY AT THE AK STEEL PLANT THE DRIVER WAS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A URINALYSIS SPECIMEN AS WELL AS A BAC. BOTH TESTS WERE NEGATIVE. ACCORDING TO THE DRIVER, HE WAS NEAR THE CAB OF THE TRACTOR WHEN HE HEARD WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS A LOUD POP. WHEN HE GOT TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER HE OBSERVED THE SPRAYING ACID FROM OUR PRODUCT HOSE. HE THEN CLOSED THE INTERNAL VALVE USING THE PUMP LEAVER AND THEN THE EXTERNAL VALVE. HE STATED THAT HE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO AK STEEL PERSONNEL WHO IMMEDIATELY BEGAN SPREADING SODA ASH ON THE PRODUCT TO NEUTRALIZE IT. HE STATED THAT THE PRODUCT WAS BEING SWEPT TO THE PLANTS ACID RECOVERY SYSTEM. HOWEVER, HE WAS NOT CERTAIN IF PRODUCT LANDED OUTSIDE OF THE CONTAINMENT AREA. GREAT WEST CASUALTY COMPANY WAS CONTACTED TO PROTECT OUR INTEREST. THEY ARE ASSIGNING CUSTARD INSURANCE TO THE CLAIM. HELEN JETT (PVS) WAS ADVISED OF THE INCIDENT AT ABOUT 1800 HOURS. ANTICIPATING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NOT PROPERLY CONTAINED, I CONTACTED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO PO3 ARSENAULT. I EXPLAINED THAT THE PRODUCT MAY HAVE BEEN CONTAINED BY THE CONSIGNEE'S SYSTEM AND THAT THIS REPORT MAY BE DELETED IF IT WAS DECLARED A ""CONTROLLED SPILL."" INCIDENT NUMBER 542164 WAS ASSIGNED TO THIS CASE. AT ABOUT 1900 HOURS, I SPOKE WITH JAMES HOWARD (AK STEEL SAFETY DIRECTOR) WHO CONFIRMED THAT THE INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED AS DESCRIBED BY THE DRIVER. HE ESTIMATED THAT THE QUANTITY OF PRODUCT WAS LESS THAN 200 GALLONS AND THAT THE PRODUCT WAS CONTAINED IN THE SYSTEM. HE ALSO STATED THAT GRADY MEDEWIG (AK STEEL ENVIRONMENTAL OFFICER) DETERMINED THAT THE SPILL WAS ENTIRELY CONTAINED AND THAT THE INCIDENT WAS NON-REPORTABLE. THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT REVEALED THAT THE PRODUCT HOSE HAD NOT BEEN RECERTIFIED SINCE 9/5/97. THE COMPANY POLICY REQUIRES HOSES TO BE TESTED ANNUALLY. HOW THE HOSE SLIPPED THROUGH THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS IS UNCLEAR. AT 1905 HOURS I CONTACTED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AND ADVISED THEM THAT THE INCIDENT WAS A CONTROLLED SPILL. PO3 ARSENAULT STATED THAT THE EPA HAD BEEN ADVISED AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO REPORT THE INFORMATION TO THEM THE FOLLOWING DAY. ON 15 SEPTEMBER 2000, I CONTACTED THE EPA AND REPORTED THIS INFORMATION TO FRED MICKE.
