The site is located at 264 Wilson Park Rd. in Statesville, NC. The customer's AST did not have an overfill prevention valve and the fuel delivery amount was overestimated. As a result, an overfill of the diesel fuel tank occurred during transport delivery.    The estimated overfill amount was approximately 100 gallons of diesel fuel. The fuel truck driver used a spill kit to stop the fuel spill and called dispatch to report the incident. Great Lakes Petroleum called their Hazmat Responder for the area. CERT (Carolina Emergency Response Team) responded to the incident that day and began clean up of the site. The spill did not reach waters/drains and was contained on gravel/dirt. CERT removed the contaminate and conducted on site field tests to confirm that all the fuel had been removed.     A report was filed with the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources (NCDENR) as the spill was greater than 25 gallons. CERT has disposed of the hazardous material per state and federal laws and an abatement report will be submitted once final lab results are conducted. It is anticipated that NCDENR will issue a NFA (No Further Action) response.    The fuel driver has been reprimanded and additional training will be conducted at Great Lakes Petroleum to ensure future risk of spills is reduced/eliminated. In addition, the company is investigating policies that will require customers who have their own fuel tanks be required to install overfill prevention valves on their tanks. The valves are designed to physically shut off during fuel delivery once the AST reaches capacity.",Great Lakes Petroleum is increasing their driver training and evaluating operating procedures for fuel delivery including quarterly safety meetings and staff tests/exams. A wireless monitoring system has recently been installed that will help dispatchers correctly gauge fuel delivery amounts. Additional steps being investigated to prevent overfill include installation of overfill prevention valves on storage tanks.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10400,Great Lakes Petroleum,US,

He advised the crew, and we all went on oxygen. An emergency was declared and we returned to DWC. We were able to jettison about 40,000lbs prior to landing. After landing we were met by emergency equipment. We cleared the runway and opened the doors and hatches we had access to until the stairs arrived. We then opened up the main cargo door with the assistance of emergency crews (on oxygen) to allow the fumes to dissipate. The exact source of the fumes was not immediately identified but there were class 5.1 hazmat containers on board.  We believe that there was insufficient ullage in the containers.  4 containers appeared to have leaked. A very small quantity of material leaked.   40,000 lbs of fuel = 5891 gallons.

The equipment used for application was a tractor, an application chisel bar, and the wagon carrying the anhydrous ammonia storage tanks.   The running gear of the wagon had a structural failure which cause the wagon running gear to separate. The break away coupling device on the chisel applicator failed to operate properly during the separation of the running gear. Due to the failure on the break away coupling device, the hose that connected the tanks to the chisel applicator stretched and torn, which caused a release of anhydrous ammonia.

The idea is to bring the vehicle under control without attempting to radically change the path which can cause liquid load shifting and add to the potential for overturn.

When opening the trailer door it was found that a 330 gallon metal systanks of hazards waste had developed a small leak about halfway down or the middle of the tank with a small stream of liquid waste running out.The cause of the leak is believed to be from a small hole developed from corrosion. Absorbent pads were placed on the ground under the trailer to prevent spreading of the material and due to the angle of the ground on which the trailer was sitting all the liquid was at the front of the trailer and no liquid ran into the warehouse. EQ Environmental was on site at the time conducting work unrelated to the spill so response time was instant. The spill was contained and cleanup completed within two hours of the spill being found..,"We are currently waiting for response from the tank owner Systech to provide any corrective actions on their end.

Appropriate notifications were made and emergency responders activated.     There were two cars in question initially, tank car UTLX 67117 (a loaded Cresylic Acid car) + tank car UTLX 901486 (a loaded Butyl Acrylates car). Once local responders arrived on site, the two tank cars were isolated and properly secured. Responders donned appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), utilized air monitoring devices to check atmosphere, and accessed tank car UTLX 901486 car. After several air monitoring phases, rail car appurtenance securement check, and odor verification, tank car UTLX 901486 was cleared not to be actively leaking and responders moved on to tank car UTLX 67117.    On the UTLX 67117, it was noted that the bottom outlet valve to tank shell bolt/flanged connection was leaking (one drip per minute). It was noted that two of eight bottom outlet valve (BOV) flange bolts were less than tool tight, once tightened the leak stopped. The tank car was then isolated in the yard for more observation and air monitoring verification that the leak had stopped.     Due to the hazards associated with the commodity being shipped and the nature of the incident, it was decided that the situation had too many un-known/potentially dangerous variable and therefore the tank car would need to be transferred into a new tank car package and then home shopped for root cause investigation and repair as applicable. The field response could not verify the integrity of the seal or the condition of the sealing surface or hardware.     * There were 3 KCS employees who complained of eye irritation and therefore taken to the hospital as a precaution. They were seen and released. The symptoms improved over a short amount of time.    File Note: Item 13-the consignee information was supplied as noted from the waybill in the ""consignee"" section.

The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released the offeror and consignee must dialog to calculate exact about released from the amount shipped vs received at destination.    File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.    Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O. Box 219335, Kansas City, MO 64121.

Joseph McCann, a CSXT hazardous materials manager, and HEPACO, a CSXT emergency response contractor, were dispatched to the scene and found the cause of the release due to a deteriorated manway nozzle gasket.

During inspection of the car it was also noted that the bottom outlet valve operating handle was secured in the open position.  The car was equipped with a secondary bottom outlet valve which prevented this exception from resulting in a release of product.

Inspection of the car initially found no issues and no apparent source of an odor.  Further investigation found that there were elevated readings of hydrogen sulfide near the hinge side of the manway cover.  Upon opening the manway, the barrel gasket in the manway nozzle was found to be deformed and in poor condition.  Further, a second gasket was present in the groove in the manway cover as well.  Both gaskets were removed and replaced by a one-time-use gasket formed from Gore-Tex gasket material.  The car was secured and the outside rinsed with bleach to remove the odor.

If  a battery  is discovered  without  proper  contact  covers  Tradebe  applies cover  to the  electrodes. Once the  batteries are  inspected  and  the  electrodes have been   properly   covered,   the   batteries  are   manually   repackaged   into  55-gallon containers.  The containers are  labeled  and  staged  for shipment until  the  battery filled containers are offered for transportation to processing facility.    On November  21, 2013,  a load  of thirty-three (33)  containers and  one  pallet  of batteries of  various   types  (""Battery  Shipment"")   was  loaded  onto  a  trailer   and transported  to  INMETCO battery  processing   facility  in  Ellwood   City,  PA,  by Thunderbird Trucking LLC (a division of Tradebe).  The Thunderbird driver arrived at INMETCO at approximately 11:00pm,  several  hours  before the INMETCO facility was  open  to  receive  inbound  shipments.The  Thunderbird driver   parked  the tractor  and  trailer  full of Battery Shipment  at an INMETCO onsite  staging  area  for inbound  and outbound shipments and stayed  in the cab of tractor with  the trailer still attached  to the tractor.    At approximately 2:45 am on the morning of November 22, 2013,   the driver awoke to rumbling sounds coming from the trailer.  He exited his tractor  to investigate the sounds  and observed  a red glow at the top of his trailer at the front (i.e., nose) of the trailer  and realized that  the Battery Shipment  had caught fire.   The driver  then  ran to the  other  vehicles  parked  at  the  INMETCO staging  area  and  advised  the  other drivers  of the fire. The other  drivers  quickly drove their vehicles off-site.  The Thunderbird driver  then  ran and alerted  the INMETCO guard shack of the incident. The guards  immediately contacted  the Ellwood City Fire Department (ECFD). ECFD was notified of the incident  at approximately 2:50am.  The ECFD arrived  on site at 2:57 am with eight (8) fire fighters  who assessed  the incident  as a ""small fire"" and proceeded  to extinguish  the fire believing three to four containers were involved.  At 3:21am the fire was contained  and the ECFD proceeded  to conduct ""MOP UP STAGE"" at the location.

The lead train car hit our cargo tank trailer on the frame rail on the curb side and pushed the trailer and tractor onto the driver side.  The rear portion of the trailer came to rest on top of a concrete Jersey Barrier, causing the edge of the front head to strike the steel rail, which punctured it at this location.  The rest of the cargo tank contained some scuffs and scars but contained the material well.  Hydrochloric acid leaked from this puncture site approximately the same way a 1 1/2"" hose might lose product.    Great West Casualty Company was in the process of getting Inland Waters to perform the clean­ up, but we learned that EnviroServe, another hazmat clean-up service, already had some personnel and equipment on site.  They have a positive working relationship with Arcelor Mittal, so they took on the clean-up duties.  A lined vac truck was used to suck up the spilled acid from the puddle that had formed nearby.  It was able to remove product about as quickly as it was being released, so an estimated maximum of 500 gallons were on the ground at one time.  Bags  of soda ash were used to neutralize the trail of spilled acid.  Approximately 15 gallons of Hydrochloric Acid entered the intra-plant storm sewer system and reached the Strip Mill Water Treatment Plant, where it was treated.    The responding fire/hazmat crews determined it would be safest to empty all acid from the cargo tank (pumping into a vac truck) and remove all diesel fuel prior to up-righting the equipment. This was done, and the tractor and trailer were transported to the First Class Transport Terminal in Strasburg on 11119/2013. We learned soon after that the collected acid that had been spilled or removed from the cargo tank had been transported to a facility and properly disposed of. Photos are attached to further illustrate the damage to the cargo tank.  The collision occurred at or about 12:10 p.m. on 11115/2013 and the leak began at that time.  The driver and a railroad spotter were taken for medical evaluation and released later that afternoon. At 12:51 p.m. due to changes in wind direction, parts of the Arcelor Mittal Hot Mill and Cold Mill were evacuated.  Traffic into the plant through Harvard Road was stopped.  Only essential personnel were permitted in the spill area.  At 16:45 Arcelor Mittal Security received word that traffic and work could resume in the area.  The leak had been resolved and remaining product had been pumped off through holes drilled into the cargo tank within approximately 4• hours. Clean-up ended at 20:05 hours and Richard's  Towing removed the First Class Transport truck at20:50.","Arcelor Mittal has been communicating changes to their site in the vicinity of the plant acid tank which will allow Cargo Tank Motor Vehicles to make delivery without crossing the railroad tracks twice.  This involves moving a fire hydrant and water line, road widening, additional paving, and installation of a guardrail between the new truck turn around area and the plant rail system.  I understand this was a recommendation of the U.S. Coast Guard.  Work was underway soon after the event, possibly the next week day, and I understand the guardrail and fire hydrant re-installation are the final remaining projects which are expected to be completed soon.  This should make the plant are much safer for commercial drivers and the intra-plant railroad personnel and prevent any future recurrence oftrain-acid tanker collision.    It is our opinion that if the cargo tank had rolled over onto the rail and the rear of the trailer had not been elevated on the Jersey Barrier, the tank would not have ruptured.  If the tank had come down on the dirt or a flat paved surface, we don't  think it would have ruptured.  We are very impressed with the strength of the Tankcon unit given the amount of punishment it received. This was basically a freak accident where the cargo tank rolled in such a way that resulted in the edge of the front head coming down directly on a rail, which punctured it.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,30,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,76141,"FIRST CLASS TRANSPORT, INC.",US,

The mail shipment originated in New York (JFKIA) and was accepted by Emirates from the United States Post Office as a mail consignment, under document number AV-7: USB3EJF01909. The parcel was then transported on flight EK202 on November 11th, 2014 from JFK International Airport to Dubai International Airport. The shipment was packaged in a way that prevented Emirates’ handling staff from verifying its contents without opening the parcel. Contents were discovered during a routine x-ray screening of transit mail by the Dubai Police. After Dubai Police opened the package, it was discovered that the internal boxes contained the paint canisters in original packaging. Hazmat documentation was not provided to Emirates by the  shipper at the time of tender. After classifying shipment as suspect D.G., Emirates contacted the shipper for confirmation of the contents. At which point the shipper stated that an MSDS would be provided.  However, till date shipper has not been able to provide Emirates with an MSDS and has been incooperative. Emirates was able to obtain an MSDS from the manufacturer's website confirming the clasification of the hazardous material.  The shipment is currently being held in Dubai, until shipper appoints an agent to perform proper markings, labeling, and documentation. Only after all IATA/ICAO and FAA requirements have been met, will the shipment be moved to its final destination in Moscow, or returned back to the shipper.",,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,ZZ,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,EMIRATES SKYCARGO,US,

Correcting the unit back onto the highway the pup trailer lost control and layed over on it's side. The impact split seams out of the head and rear bulkheads allowing product to escape. Trailer drug over 700' and tore skin more allowing entire contents to spill on both sides of the 2 lane roadway.   Driver stopped put out warning devices and guarded the roadway till emergency services could arrive and assist. Hanser's Wrecker service out of Billings brought in fly ash and loaders to soak up as much residue off the highway as possible and secured the area till Montana Environmental and LMH environmental (contracted with insurance) determined the spill area and disposal method of contaminated soil. Remediation has been completed and we are waiting for Montana DEQ to release the claim.,All drivers reviewed the accident and viewed the PHMSA FMCSA video on tank rollover.
