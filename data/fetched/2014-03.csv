During delivery the transfer hose burst for unknown reasons and diesel fuel was spilled on the site (approximately 200 gallons). The site is a large industrial parcel with gravel and the fuel was contained on the individual site and did not reach any drains or waterways.     A Hazmat responder was immediately called and environmental staff went to the site. The spill was also reported to the South Carolina Department of  Health and Environmental Controls (SCDHEC). SCDHEC visited the site the day after the incident. Initial amounts of fuel were removed by vacuum truck and excavation of the contaminated soil/gravel followed.    A initial site assessment will be performed by a licensed geologist to confirm remediation.All fuel was disposed of as hazadous waste as required by law. Manifests document proper disposal by the clean up contractor.,The incident most likely occurred from a manufacturing flaw or damage to the equipment (hose). Hoses are inspected as part of regular maintenance and drivers/service are trained to look for signs of damage and replaces hoses when worn.    Great Lakes Petroleum will issue a guidance reminding drivers and staff to inspect hoses with each fueling. A review of this inncident will also be incorporated into ongoing training for service and our drivers.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,15800,Great Lakes Petroleum,US,

The spillage on the shell of TAEX 2387 was cleaned. Also, a small amount of accumulated ground spillage under TAEX 2387 was remediated. TAEX 2387 will be held in isolation pending completion of the FRA OTMA process.  On 3/21/2014, TAEX 2387 was reported leaking commodity again while isolated in the BNSF Amarillo railyard. Containment receptacles were placed under TAEX 2387 to capture commodity drips. BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders inspecting TAEX 2387 reported the leak source was at the liquid valve's flange connection. Further inspection revealed that the liquid valve's flange gasket had split and allowed commodity to escape at this flange connection.

ST. Lucie] The driver stated that he had just started pumping into the customers tank [2 minutes] when he noticed Bleach coming from the pipe on the ground. He shut everything down and went into the store and notified the store manager [Carlos]. I called 2 employees to get a bag of Sodium Sulfite, a couple of empty open top drums and a couple of shovels and put it all in the pickup truck. I gave them the address and instructed them to go ahead and I would meet them there. I grabbed a MSDS for Sodium Hypochlorite and the Weight / Reportable Quantity chart and took it with me in the case that the items would be needed. I was also told that Carlos [from Gorman] had contacted EPA. I reported the spill to my superior [Ron Zeigler] and was instructed by him to contact CBI [John Katzor] to meet me at the site so he could evaluate the mitigation of the spill. I ]Evelio] arrived on scene at 1:15PM, John Katzor arrived on scene 1:20PM we conducted the investigation and found that a 2” schedule 80 PVC coupler was cracked all the way around and someone had put a schedule 40 PVC saddle coupler over the cracked schedule 80 PVC coupler. The AUC personnel were instructed to spread Sodium Sulfite over the small area that Bleach had gotten on and to mix up the dirt to be neutralized. Once this was completed dirt samples were pulled and tested for PH, on the other side of the fence the dirt PH readings were 8 [good] on the area where the pipe sat on the ground was a little bit higher so we added a little bit more Sodium Sulfite and mixed it in and pulled another dirt sample, the second sample the PH was 8 [good] John Katzor stated that this was good and no further actions were required. Our installer had been called to go to Gorman and make the necessary repairs on the pipe, the installer arrived at Gorman at 2PM. Installer cut out the coupler and pipe and placed 2 schedule 80 PVC couplers and 12” of schedule 80 PVC pipe and glued everything together. Store manager and my driver were instructed to allow the glue to dry for 30 minutes before the pipe was used. All AUC personnel started back to the plant at approx. 2:30PM.",Corrective action: Instructed the driver that if there is any schedule 40 PVC on the lines that he is pushing product through to the tanks the Branch must be notified and gets approval to off-load product.   • There is to be no schedule 40 PVC used on pipe lines that we off-load Sodium Hypochlorite through. It all must be schedule 80 PVC.  • Repairs to the schedule 80 PVC should only be conducted by our installer [this way we know that the correct material has been used.  Recommendation: Have customers plumbing inspected [by company representative] to make sure that the correct PVC material is being used and customers aren’t making repairs with the wrong PVC material.,No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Allied Universal Corp,US,

Contract responders inspecting OFOX 52932 reported finding the top operated bottom outlet valve's (TOBOV) operating rod approximately two turns in the open position. The TOBOV was closed which ended the commodity release at the bottom outlet. In addition, the packing gland nut (PGN) at the TOBOV's operating rod was one full turn less that tool tight. The bottom outlet's closure cap (BOC) was also one full turn from being tool tight thus allowing commodity to escape. The PGN and the BOC were tool tightened to full securement.

Dedow noted tank car RTMX 2511, load, Petroleum Crude Oil (PG III), to have been offered for transportation contrary to the Hazardous Materials Regulations of the Department of Transportation, CFR Title 49.    His further inspection, and later confirmed by inspection by CR's A. Richter, Risk Management, and representatives of Hepaco-React, Conrail's environmental/hazmat emergency response contractor, noted the following:    Protective housing/bread box hinge was broken, with multiple plastic ties partially securing the housing cover to the mounting plate; said cover was also cocked and not sealing the interior valve mounting assembly as designed; once the cover was opened, it was noted the 1"" air valve was partially open and valve's closure plug not even hand tight; and the 3"" liquid valve was cocked and not mounted evenly on the mounting plate (lifted approximately 1/2"" up on one side, allowing product to have escaped at one point during the cars movement from origination.  This product was heavy crude and had set up on the mounting plate next to and underneath the cocked liquid valve; the liquid valve's closure plug was also not even hand tight; and, one of eight manway cover securement bolts was not tool tight.    All closures were made tool tight during this inspection.  As the material was the kind that sets up similarly as Asphalt, the car was permitted to be moved onto destination (made without further incident), unloaded at the original consignee, NuStar Asphalt Refining, Paulsboro, NJ.

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders inspecting NATX 301684 reported the liquid valve was not fully closed with its camlock closure cap loose. The responders immediately closed the liquid valve ending any further commodity release. The commodity outage was checked and found appropriate. All other valves and fittings were found secure. The liquid valve's camlock closure cap was missing the pin on one retainer clip which allowed the clip to fall off onto the valve housing plate leaving the camlock closure cap with only one retention clip loosely securing the closure cap. Responders applied an appropriately sized bolt in place of the missing pin and properly secured the retention clip onto the camlock closure cap. Response was concluded by 0200 hrs. CDT, 3/28/2014. Afterwards, contractors remediated ground spillage and power washed (from ground level) the spillage from the side shell of NATX 301684. Additional cleaning (degreaser application followed by a hot water pressure wash) of NATX 301684 was accomplished at the BNSF railyard in Lafayette, LA on 4/04/2014.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,4610,BNSF Railway Company,US,

He approached the intersection of county road 317 and county road 68. As he was negotiating a left hand turn to head eastbound the driver turned too sharply sending the rear axle into the ditch on the left side of the road. This caused the load's center of gravity to shift beyond the tire base. This then caused the unit to partially overturn in the ditch and partially on the roadway.,This incident has become a safety topic for our entire operations. This incident has allowed us to share in our training what was the root cause and how each of our drivers could have negotiated the turn in a correct manner.

It is normal procedure to release a small amount of propane vapor from a bleeder screw to prevent overfilling the tank being filled. Snow had fell off the roof creating a valley between the snow back and the structure. This allow the small amount of vapor to collect. A heater exhaust greater than 10' turned on igniting the vapor and causing the propane to flash. This was quickly controlled, there where no injuries and nothing was burned, melted, or charred. The delivery vehicle was not in transit and there were no failures or defects and the flash did not happen at the vehicle. The Fire Department was called in as a safety precaution. State of Maine Propane inspectors also visited the site. There were no violation found and we were commented for our response.    Please request more details if required.

WALNUT STREET, NAZARETH, PENNSYLVANIA. WHEN THE LOAD DROP WAS ALMOST COMPLETED (DELIVERY IS BY GRAVITY) THE TRANSPORT DRIVER LEFT THE DELIVERY HOSE CONNECTION POINT AT THE TANK FILL RISER AND RETURNED TO THE TRUCK CAB. DURING THIS TIME, THE HOSE COUPLING CONNECTION TO THE TANK FILL RISER ADAPTER CAME LOOSE AND LEAKED APPROXIMATELY 138-GALLONS OF GASOLINE.    THE GAS STATION LOT IS SLOPED TOWARDS EAST WALNUT STREET. THE GASOLINE FLOWED OFF THE LOT, ACROSS THE STREET, APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET TO THE INTERSECTION WITH SOUTH NEW STREET AND THEN INTO A STORM WATER INLET APPROXIMATELY 400 FEET FROM THE INTERSECTION.    THE STORM SEWER OUTLETS APPROXIMATELY 400 FEET TO THE EAST INTO A STONE LINED CHANNEL THAT DRAINS INTO AN ABANDONED QUARRY AND INTO A WETLANDS. THE WETLANDS AND QUARRY WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE RELEASE.    THE LOCAL FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS RESPONDED TO THE SPILL. LEWIS ENVIRONMENTAL WAS CONTRACTED TO PROVIDE SPILL RESPONSE AND SPREAD GRANULATED CLAY ABSORBENTS, PADS AND BOOMS TO CLEAN UP THE RELEASE.    AT THIS TIME SIXTEEN 55-GALLON 17H DRUMS CONTAINING SPENT ABSORBENT ARE STAGED ON THE GAS STATION PROPERLY. ALL DRUMS ARE PROPERLY LABELLED AS HAZARDOUS WASTE (FLAMMABILITY).

AROUND 6:15PM AN IBCA SHUTTLE FILLED WITH 200 GALLONS OF WATER BURST.  THE IBCA WAS BEING USED AS A STATIONARY BLEED OFF TANK TO REMOVE PRESSURE FROM THE BULK HEAD USED TO TRANSFER ANHYDROUS AMMONIA FROM THE TRANSPORT TO THE BULK FACILITY.  THE AMMONIA WAS TRANSFERRED INTO THE IBCA THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK VIA 3/8' HOSE.  IT WAS LEARNED THROUGH INTERVIEWS THAT THE BLEEDER VALVE ON THE BULK PLANT THAT RAN TO THE IBCA WAS LEFT ON DURING THE TRANSFER.  UNDER NORMAL FILLING PROCEDURE THIS VALVE IS TO BE LEFT OFF.  THE PUMPING OF ANHYDROUS DIRECTLY INTO THE IBCA CAUSED THE CONTAINER TO BECOME PRESSURIZED AND THEN BURST.
