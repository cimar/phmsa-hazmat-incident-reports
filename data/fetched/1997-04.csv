WHEN OUR DRIVER HOOKED UP TO THE TRAILER ON 4/22/97, HE NOTICED THAT THE GROUND BENEATH THE MID SECTION OF THE TRAILER WAS STAINED.  UPON OPENING THE REAR DOOR OF THE TRAILER A DRUM WAS SPOTTED WITH A LID POPPED UP AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE.  THROUGH AIR MONITORING IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TRAILER COULD BE ENTERED SAFELY.  THE DRUM IN QUESTION IS A CONSOLIDATED DRUM OF WASTES FROM A HOUSEHOLD HAZARDOUS WASTE DAY EVENT. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT THE DRUM WAS A CONSOLIDATION OF GASOLINE, OILS AND PAINTS.  THERE MUST ALSO HAVE BEEN A FOAM SEALANT OF ICOCYANATE ORIGIN CONSOLIDATED IN THE DRUM.  A REACTION CAUSING POLYMERIZATION OCCURRED WHICH RESULTED IN SOLIDIFICATION OF THE CONTENTS CREATING INTERNAL PRESSURE FORCING THE LID OF THE DRUM TO POP OPEN.  THE POLYMERIZATION CAUSED APPX 10 GALLONS OF THE REMAINING LIQUID TO BE FORCED OUT OF THE DRUM.  THE CONTAMINATED STONE AND GRAVEL FROM BENEATH THE TRAILER WAS EXCAVATED TO A DEPTH BELOW THE STAINING.

ON APRIL 11, 1997. PERSONNEL FROM THE RAILROAD, FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND HUNTSMAN CHEMICAL CORPORATION RESPONDED TO THE SCENE. EFFORTS WERE MADE TO COOL THE CONTENTS BY RUNNING CARBON DIOXIDE, REFRIGERATED LIQUID, THROUGH THE INTERIOR HEATER COIL PIPING. THIS WAS DISCONTINUED BECAUSE OF PROBLEMS WITH EXCESSIVE PRESSURE IN THE PIPING. A PRESSURE GAUGE WAS CONNECTED TO THE VAPOR VALVE UNDER THE TOP PROTECTIVE COVER, AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PRESSURE INSIDE THE TANK WAS 20 PSI. A SMALL AMOUNT OF VAPORS WERE STILL ESCAPING FROM A SECOND VAPOR VALUE MOUNTED ON THE TOP THE MANWAY. A DECISION WAS MADE TO MOVE THE CAR TO THE HUNTSMAN CHEMICAL PLANT. A SPECIAL TRAIN WAS MADE UP AND TANK CAR WAS MOVED TO THE PLANT, A DISTANCE OF ABOUT ONE MILE, THE CAR WAS PLACED IN THE PLANT ABOUT 7:00 P.M. ON APRIL 11, 1997. AT THE PLANT, HUNTSMAN PERSONNEL WERE TO FURTHER HANDLE THE CAR TO REMOVE THE CONTENTS. DURING THE INCIDENT THERE WAS NOT A FULL EVACUATION OF THE AREA. IT IS AN INDUSTRIAL AREA WITH FEW RESIDENCES, BUT PEOPLE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO ENTER OR LEAVE THE AREA. ** HUNTSMAN CHEMICAL PERSONNEL INDICATED THAT THE LOAD POLYMERIZED. THEY ESTIMATED THAT ABOUT 25% OF THE LOAD WAS LOST DURING THE VENTING. WHILE THE CAR WAS VENTING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS SPRAYING WATER ON THE ESCAPING VAPORS, TO REDUCE THE CHANCE OF THE VAPORS TRAVELING TO AN IGNITION SOURCE. AN INITIAL EXAMINATION OF THE CAR INDICATES THAT IT WAS NOT DAMAGED BY THE HEAT AND PRESSURES GENERATED DURING THE POLYMERIZATION PROCESS. THE TANK CAR, ACFX 81561, IS A 111A100WI BUILT IN JANUARY 1965. IT HAS A FULL CENTER SILL, IS JACKETED WITH INTERIOR HEATER COILS. THE TANK, COILS, AND SAFETY VALVE WERE LAST TESTED IN 1993.

MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE LATC AND LOCATED THE CONTAINER TRACKSIDE, WHERE A CLEAR LIQUID WAS OBSERVED LEAKING THROUGH THE REAR DOORS A RATE OF 2-3 DRIPS PER MINUTE.

COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS CONTACTED BY THE SECURITY SUPERVISOR, ICTF INTERMODAL FACILITY, LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA, REPORTING A LEAKING CONTAINER.  THE CONTAINER WAS INBOUND LANE #15 ATTEMPTING TO BE CHECKED OUT OF FACILITY.  APPARENTLY THE CONTAINER WAS MISSING A SEAL FROM THE REAR DOORS, AND WHEN THE DRIVER OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE GATE CLERK TO INSPECT THE LADING, ROUGHLY 100 POUNDS OF THE PRODUCT SPILL ONTO THE DRIVE AREA.  MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE INTERMODAL FACILITY AND FOUND THE CONTAINER PARKED IN THE OUTBOUND LANE WITH THE TRUCK AND DRIVER MISSING.  THE CLERK ADVISED AS SOON AS THE PRODUCT SPILLED FROM THE CONTAINER, THE DRIVER DISCONNECTED FROM THE CONTAINER AND LEFT THE PROPERTY.  TRAFFIC WAS DIVERTED AROUND THE OUTBOUND LANES TO PREVENT SPREADING OF THE GRANULATED MATERIAL.  ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSLOADING SERVICES, THE RAILROADS HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CONTRACTOR, ARRIVED AND BEGAN TO DRUM THE SPILLED MATERIAL.  ONCE THE BAG WAS PATCHED TO PREVENT ADDITIONAL SPILLAGE, THE DOORS WERE SECURED, AND THE CONTAINER MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK FOR FURTHER INSPECTION AND CONTAINMENT, AFTER ALL OF THE PRODUCT WAS REMOVED FROM THE ROADWAY, THE OUTBOUND GATES WERE REOPENED. INSPECTION AT THE DOCK DEVELOPED THE DRY GRANULATED PRODUCT WAS PLACED INTO 'SUPER SACKS', WHICH WERE DOUBLE STACKED ON A PALLET, WITH 2 PALLETS ACROSS THE REAR DOOR OF THE CONTAINER.  A BULK HEAD CONSTRUCTED OF 2X6 LUMBER WAS ACROSS THE REAR DOORS OF THE CONTAINER.  THE FABRIC 'SUPER SACKS' HAD ABRADED AGAINST THE LUMBER, WHICH TORE THE SACKS OPEN, THUS ALLOWED THE PRODUCT TO ESCAPE.  THERE WAS NO PLYWOOD BETWEEN THE LUMBER AND THE SACKS TO PROVIDE A FLAT SURFACE FOR THE SACKS TO REST AGAINST.  THIS METHOD OF SECURING SUPER SACKS IS NOT RECOMMENDED, NOR IS IT AN APPROVED METHOD PER THE AAR BUREAU OF EXPLOSIVES 6C FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.  UPON REMOVING THE SACKS FOR THE REAR DOOR, DEVELOPED THE REST OF THE LOAD CONSISTED OF A SINGLE SACKS PLACED ON TOP OF PALLETS THAT WERE FLOOR LOADED 2 ACROSS. AN ADDITIONAL PALLETIZED SACK HAD BEEN PLACED ON TOP OF THE FLOOR LOADED SACKS, AND CENTERED ON EACH ROW, ALL THE WAY TO THE NOSE OF THE CONTAINER, WHERE THEY WERE ONCE AGAIN DOUBLE STACKED ON FLOOR LOADED PALLETS.  DID BAGS HAD BEEN PLACED BETWEEN THE CENTERED DOUBLE STACKED SACKS AND THE SIDEWALLS TO PREVENT SHIFTING DURING TRANSIT. ALL OF THE DID BAGS HAD BURST FROM THE SACKS SHIFTING AGAINST THEM. THIS,  ALSO IS NOT A RECOMMENDED METHOD, NOR IS IT AN APPROVED METHOD PER THE AAR BUREAU OF EXPLOSIVES PAMPHLET 6C FOR THE SECUREMENT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DURING TRANSIT.  IN TOTAL, 4 EACH SUPER SACKS HAD TO BE OVERPACKED OR PLACED INTO REPLACEMENT SACKS DUE TO ABRASION DAMAGE TO THE ORIGINAL SACK.  ONCE ALL OF SACKS WERE REMOVED FROM THE CONTAINER, THE PRODUCT WAS REMOVED FROM THE FLOOR AND PLACED IN RECOVERY DRUM FOR SECUREMENT.  A TOTAL OF 3 DRUMS WERE USED TO CONTAIN THE PRODUCT.
