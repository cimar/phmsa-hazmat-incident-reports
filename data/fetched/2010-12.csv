Florence Avenue,Fresno,CA,93725,Facility,"At 6:45AM Monday December 6, 2010, during the daily facility security inspection an employee noticed that one of the rail cars on the storage track (leased track) was leaking.  He immediately called management on his radio.  The material is Magnesium Bisulfite, and is customer – owned.  We immediately called the owner of the car to notify them and request their assistance with the incident.  They then dispatched a truck to assist with the control of the leak.  At the same time Univar Operations Management and Regulatory Management were contacted as well as the local emergency responders.  Fire Dept and Hazmat teams arrived at 7:30AM.  They did not participate in the control of the incident, but they did stay in case things got worse or any injuries occurred.  In order to minimize the loss of product, we inserted a spill pallet directly on the tracks under where the product was leaking.  We then parked the customer’s tanker near the rail car and used their pump to transfer the material from the containment to their truck.  At that point we brought in 2 more customer tankers and pumped product directly from the rail car to the tankers until the rail car was empty.  In order to determine the amount of the spill, we weighed each truck light and heavy.  By calculating difference between what was loaded onto trucks and the original weight of the rail car, it was determined that approximately 90,000 lbs of product was released from the car.  The Fresno County Dept of Environmental Health Services has been notified of this, and they have contacted the State Water Quality Board.  The customer (TKI) has contacted a remediation contractor and will be working with them and the County DEHS directly.",,Yes,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,Univar USA Inc,US,

The trailer was deconned with a cleaning compound and placed back in service.","The trailer had been loaded 2 hours prior to the discovery of the leak.  The temperature at the time was 20 degrees.  The impact of the tote tank against the trailer wall may have caused the outer cage to flex, allowing contact with the valve.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Murex N.A. Ltd., the NRC - report 961702, Alabama EMA, and CHEMTREC - report 2010-12-08-00096, were notified. Eagle/SWS, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the bottom outlet cap less than tool tight.

The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.    This incident did not require a special switching move.  A 7.1 QA Non conformance report is not required for this incident.

While making a delivery, a leak from the vent cap resulted in the release of approximately 15 gallons of diesel fuel.  The free product released to the asphalt surface within the lot, and traveled into a nearby storm drain.  Environmental Services, Inc. of South Windsor, Connecticut responded to assist in cleanup, which involved the application of absorbent material to the asphalt surface, which was recovered and containerized into one (1) 55-gallon drum, pending disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  United Industrial Services of Meriden, Connecticut was dispatched to washout the affected storm drain.  United Industrial Services inspected the outfall, which provided no evidence of diesel fuel.  Free product was contained within the storm drain catch basin, which was flushed, generating approximately 198 gallons of wash water.  Disposal was coordinated in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations, and site was deemed for closure.  No further action remains.

When driver opened trailer door and looked at the tank he noticed a small drip coming from the discharge valve area.  He checked the valve handle and it seemed to be turned all of the way to the closed position.  The driver then placed absorbent materials under and around the leaking area. A field technician was immediately sent to the site to secure the leak. The field tech secured the absorbent pads around the leaking area and underneath the tank then followed the driver back to the Brisbane plant.  There was only a small amount of product that leaked out of the tank (<2 lbs) and all of it was contained with the absorbent materials.    This tank is fitted with a customer provided dry-break disconnect fitting.  The tank was inspected by Brisbane maintenance and it was found the reason for the leakage was the orientation of the valve was such that when the handle was turned to the open position it was not perfectly horizontal causing it to be at an angle when open.  This caused the handle to come into contact with the dry-break disconnect fittings not allowing the valve to open all of the way.  Customer personnel had bent the valve handle up to where it would clear the fittings allowing the valve to open, but when the valve was closed the handle was hitting on the underside of the tank preventing the valve from closing all of the way. The dry-break disconnect fitting had a defective Teflon O-ring which allowed the product to leak out.  The orientation of the valve was corrected, the handle bent back to the proper position and the O-ring replaced with a new one.  The tank, valve and dry-break were pressure tested and placed back into service.","Upon return of all tanks for filling, maintenance will inspect the orientation of the valve to ensure it is in the proper position.",No,TANK,PORTABLE TANK,57,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA Inc,US,

Hunt Corporate Drive,Lowell,AR,72745,Carrier,"COFC shipment - load was billed to JBH as non-hazardous on the EDI transmission.  JBH driver was given non-hazardous shipping papers.  Load was in-gated to BNSF intermodal facility as a non-hazardous load.  Upon arrival in CA, the load was discovered to have been loaded with 500 lbs of class 8 hazardous materials.      Internal investigation revealed the load was not offered to JBH as a hazmat load.  The most likely root cause of the incident lay with a shipper employee not fully understanding or inadequately trained to fully understand the 1001 lbs exception regulations.  500 lbs total of class 8 hazardous materials were shipped (not requiring placards); the hazmat employee who placed the order  for the shipper seems to have not realized that hazardous shipping paper, declaration, blocking & bracing, etc regulations still fully apply under the 1001 lbs exception contained in 49 CFR 172.504.  Consequently, 500 lbs of hazardous materials was not declared to JBH when the load was offered and the issue was not discovered until the cargo had nearly arrived at its final destination.    Timeline given below:    On 12/11 @ 12:48pm, JBH drivers arrived at customer to recover JBHU 249173 that had been preloaded for transport via rail from Alliance to Stockton.    • JBH driver noticed there were flammable placards on the container and that the bills had the word “HAZMAT” in a particular section.  • JB Hunt driver approached the shipping office to request the MSDS sheets so that he could do his hazmat briefing with local dispatch.  • The person on duty ( driver did not get a name ) at that point, advised the driver that there was no hazmat on the container and they went out to the yard and removed the placards themselves, stating that the container had previously come in as an inbound load with hazmat on it, and they had just forgotten to remove the placards.  • Since the container was already sealed, the driver had no reason to really question what they were telling him.  • At 1500 hrs driver arrived at the Alliance rail yard to in-gate the unit and edi billing was transmitted as non-hazardous.  • On 12/14 @ 04:49 the Stockton crew grounded this unit from the train and notified JBI that it was ready for transport to customer in Sacramento, CA.  • Based off the scheduled delivery appointment provided by our customer, We arrived a driver at the Stockton rail yard on 12/15 @ 00:11 hrs.  • Due to the nature of most of the commodity that we haul for this customer, we sent in a hazmat certified driver to pull the container. While doing his pre-trip inspection and preparing to call in for his hazmat briefing, he discovered that there were no placards on the unit, nor was there any hazmat bills. Driver then aborted his assignment and a request was sent to JB Hunt Corporate to obtain them so delivery could be made.  • 12/15 @ 06:30, local operations was questioned why they needed hazmat bills if the load was non-hazardous. It was then determined by documentation th","Internal investigation satisfied JBH Safety the shipper does not systematically fail to disclose hazardous materials when offered; this appears to have been an isolated incident.  JBH safeties recommendation has been to offer additional hazardous materials training to our partner shipper.  JBH is satisfied the shipper has been very receptive to our offer to receive additional hazardous materials training.  JBH load & ride solutions will also provide the shipper with additional training and support to meet all blocking & bracing requirements of DOT/FRA and of JBH’s partner rail carriers.  JBH and our partner carriers will increase random inspections of loads originating from the shipper, with a particular emphasis on loads containing exception quantities of hazardous materials to ensure these are being properly secured.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,"Plastic pail, open head, capacity 10 gallons or less",PAIL PLS,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,J.B.

The incident occurred in a construction zone, where trucks were diverted onto a temporary roadway.  Pictures taken at the scene seem to indicate that the roadway literally crumbled beneath the semi-truck's tires.  NOTE - SEVERAL incidents have occurred in the same construction zone and the fire department repeatedly asked for the closure of that portion of roadway.  Following notification, Ross Transportation faxed shipment information to the Ohio State Highway Patrol, the scene was stabilized by Kingsville Fire, Plymouth Fire, Ashtabula HAZ MAT and Ohio State Highway Patrol.  Emergency responders, tow-trucks and clean-up contractors were dispatched to the scene.  The roll-over caused a breach in the tractor's fuel tanks and less than 170 gallons of diesel was released and less than 1 pint of hazardous waste shipment was released from the tanker all of it caught in the manhole well.  A construction worker dug three holes to catch the diesel fuel being released.  Then as the tow truck operator slowly uprighted the tanker, the shipment was transferred into a vac tanker.  Once all material had been transferred, the vac tanker vacuumed up the diesel and the holes were stuffed with absorbant.  The absorbant was removed 24 hours later and so signs of diesel remained. The vac tanker and clean-up crew finished up around 7PM when the roadway was reopened.",Company drivers have been told to avoid the area until roadway construction is complete.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,60000,"Ross Transportation SErvices, Inc.",US,

The fallen drawbar component struck the underside of NAHX 2965 causing a small puncture hole at the A-end forward facing bottom outlet hopper slope sheet. This puncture hole allowed product to spill out during movement and continued until the BNSF train was stopped on main track to investigate the emergency brake application that followed. Contract responders applied a temporary patch to the slope sheet hole stopping further product release. The spillage trail and the spillage underneath NAHX 2965 (where NAHX 2965 came to rest) was shoveled into super sacks and later returned to the shipper. A small amount of spillage (estimated at less than one gallon) sifted through the openings of a bridge structure into a creek below. Water samples were taken at the creek site with no recordable product contamination found.      FRA verbal emergency movement approval FRA-101202V was granted to move the temporarily repaired and still entrained NAHX 2965 to the next BNSF railyard location (Memphis, TN) for possible product transfer activities and furtherance. Later, FRA-10120834 was subsequently granted to supersede the verbal movement approval. NAHX 2965 arrived at the BNSF Memphis railyard without further incident.  NAHX 2965 was reinspected at the BNSF Memphis railyard and contract responders applied an overlaid patch atop the temporary patch on the slope sheet to ensure no further product release from this hole during subsequent movement of NAHX 2965 back to the shipper.

The maintainer reported that the bottom operated BOV handle was not pinned and in the open position; and its bottom outlet closure cap (BOC) was not applied. The maintainer repositioned the BOV operating handle to the closed position, ending the product release. The BOC was then applied and tightened.   Afterwards, BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders inspected TILX 315662 and ensured the BOV and BOC were properly secured. Inspection of product outage inside TILX 315662 indicated that TILX 315662 was mostly empty. Environmental contractors vacuumed spillage that had migrated into a track-side ditch that had some standing water. Recovered liquid (product/water mix) was stored onsite in a portable Frac tank for content sampling and future disposal. The main track was inspected from the spill site back to Emporia, KS (approx. 13 miles) with no product spillage noted.

MORRISON,TECHNICAL SERVICES SPECIALIST,328 Bunola River Road,Bunola,PA,15020,Carrier,Shipper/Carrier employee was offloading product from an IBC when he noticed a leak in the area behind the valve.  A drip pan was in place to catch the material leaking.  The employee continued tranferring product to customer tank in order to minimize the amount leaking.  When the consignee's tanks (2 @ 245 gallons) were full there was still approximately 20-30 gallons left in the tote that overflowed the drip pan and leaked onto the ground.  A consignee employee and the shipper/carrier driver cleaned up the spilled material.,"Shipper/carrier employees were informed of this incident during periodic safety meetings.  Shipper/carrier employees perform a pre-fill inspection on each hazardous material container, including examining the valve.  The container did not leak during the filling, storage or transportation of the IBC. Subsequent investigation revealed that a number of container's valve threads were cross-threaded. It is likely that the weight of the hose and product on the cross-threaded valve during product transfer resulted in the leak.

On Monday, 12/20/2010, the consignee notified BNSF that employees arriving to work noticed a product pile under the B-end bottom hopper outlet. The consignee reported that the B-end bottom outlet's discharge door track was clogged with product/dirt which prevented the full closure of this bottom discharge door and subsequent spillage of product from this partially open bottom outlet. The shipper seal was intact on this bottom outlet. The bottom outlet door track was cleaned and the bottom outlet closed. The consignee cleaned the ground spillage at the site and recovered product to be recycled for reuse by the consignee.

It was calm, sunny and 4 degrees with a clear frozen road but not covered and compacted with snow. Charles then saw a car approaching him fishtailing. It seemed to gain control only to start fishtailing again. He stayed in his lane and tried to pull over to the right slightly as the car lost control and collided with our truck. AS it slid to the left into the oncoming lane, it hit the truck in the drivers fron bumper and left quarter with right side.    The momentum of the loaded truck (1000 gallons of gas and 3500 gallons of fuel oil) then pushed the car an estimted 100-150 feet into the ditch. Both vehicles remained upright and no fires or leaking of fuels occurred. The Minnesota duty officer ws called.     There was a witness named Erick Dewey 763-250-8345, saw the whole thing. He was driving a handicapped van with clients in there so couldn't stay but called with his information to the investigators. He even called Mora and JIm Gutzwiller with his information and said our driver couldn't of done anymore.    Charles was uninjured and seemed to be ok. The driver of the car was unresponsive and died it is thought instantly. The body was removed from the car at 10:19AM. The driver of the Suburban that took the body away returned to the scene and I overheard him say that ""the driver may have had a heart condition, they need to see her medical records."" That may of lead to the incident. Her I.D. is not yet known, as is her insurance information.    Chisago County Sheriff Department will be doing the accident report; the State Patrol did the accident reconstruction with its case numbe MN00RA000561. By 1PM we completed pumping the truck's contents into another of our trucks brought to the scene by Rod Hamann, then it was pulled out of the ditch and taken to Dan's Towing in Forest Lake where it went through a DOT Inspection by Technical Sergeant Micheal Wayne #188) phone 651-405-6197. It will then be taken to Determan Brownie in MInneapolis immediately following. The tank has little or no damage. Chassis damage remains to be scene but looks to be in grave condition.     Officers say all of our vehicle paperwork was in good order. There were no hints of the incident being our fault whatsoever from anyone. Federated employees other than Charles at the scene were Petroleum Division Manager and Charle's supervisor Brian Devries (phone 763-238-2846), Rom Rausch, Safety Director (phone 763-286-2299). and Rod Hamann the driver of the other fuel truck. Charles said the officers on the scene gave him an alcohol breath test, Tom took Charles to the Osceola Medical Center for the DOT post-accident urine drug test. After the test was completed Tom and Charles had lunch and then Tom took Charles to his home in North Branch.","-PACKAGE PERFORMED WELL, NO RELEASE, EMERGENCY PERSONEL PERFORMED EFFECIENTLY & AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,23659,"FEDERATED CO-OPS, INC",US,

At the time of the incident, weather conditions were partly cloudy skies and an air temperature of 30 degrees with winds out of the north at 10 to 20 mph. Mr. Yeatman halted all operations and informed the engineer of the train, Randall Rash, of the situation. Mr. Rash shut down the train's sole locomotive and informed MDDE's Federalsburg Office of the smell. The Federalsburg Office immediately notified MDDE President Eric Callaway, MDDE Assistant General Manager Scott Harris and Earl Slacomb at Tri-Gas & Oil, the consignee from whom all of the loaded propane railcars were consigned. Mr. Harris arrived on the scene at 0947 and was met by Lieutenant Edgell from the Federalsburg Fire Department who worked at E S Steel, an industry adjacent to the Federalsburg runaround track. Mr. Yeatman had notified the industry of the leak and E S Steel hAd suspened all operations and welding. E S Welding did not do any evacuations.      Upon checking car HOMX 180173, Lieutenant Edgell discovered a leak on the top of the car, evidenced by ice and frost that was covering tow valves, as well as the sound of escaping air and the strong smell of propane from the hatch. At 0958, Tri-Gas & Oil representatives Earl Slacomb and Joe Capello arrived and inspected the top of car HOMX 180173 with Mr. Harris and Lieutenant Edgell. The seal was still on the car and all parites agreed that the car did not appear to have been tampered with. Mr. Capello brokE the seal on the hatch to reveal two vavles heavily frosted over and loose. Mr. Capellos retrieved a pipe wrench and began tightening both valves. After each vaLVe was tight, the frost was brushed off and the valves were soap tested for leaks. All parties agreed that the leak has been stopped and Mr. Cappello then closed and secured the hatch.    At 1017, Mr. Harris notified Lisa Matsinger at FRA and briefed her on the vents that unfolded. No injuries or evacuations resulted from the leaking railcar. Shortly after 1020, Mr. Capellos re-sealed the railcar and Mr. Rash re-fired the locomotive on the train and the train crew continued switching operations. At 1228, car HOMX 180173 was  placed for unloading in Williamsburg, Md, at tower 8 on Tri-Gas & Oil rail siding.

The packing was tightened stopping the release.  To facilitate response, removed seals Air Liquide 0870835 and 0870836. These seals were replaced with seal numbers are 2692074 and 2692075.    KCS emergency mitigation services were activated to provide for special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, dedicated internal management oversight, train/yard crew delay, and regulatory reporting as appropriate.  KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 may apply as services require.    Report Notes:  Item 27, amount in package, was estimated by preparer. This action was to facilitate data acceptance by defective DOT IT system edits. Specifically, this estimated quantity was required for two reasons:   (1)because the shipper only provided bulk quantity on shipping paper, as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements; and   (2)because the DOT e-system requires data in this field which use the same units of measure as found in the capacity field.   KCS will continue to report in this fashion unit instructed differently by DOT or PHMSA.    Report Notes:  Item 26a, package markings, didn't provide selection for proper DOT specifications. The DOT specification for this package is 204W. The DOT electronic system forces data to be entered in this field. Therefore to make DOT accept this report data other than 204W was entered.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NAR's are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

THE CENTRIFUGAL LOADING PUMP CONTINUED TO TRANSFER CRUDE OIL AND THE TANK SUBSEQUENTLY OVERFILLED AND RELEASED OIL THE CONCRETE PAD ON WHICH THE TRUCK-TRAILER TEST PERFORMED ON THE PULL TRAILER WAS ON 11/29/10 AND THE PULL TRAILER CONSTRUCTION DATE WAS NOVEMBER OF 1994.  CONTRIBUTING SOURCE OF INFORMATION: DALE STRIETER, PATRIOT; SCOTT MCGOWAN AND DAVE PALMER, PAN PACIFIC PETROLEUM.    THE CALCULATED RELEASE TOTAL WAS APPROXIMATELY 50 BARRELS. THIS WAS DETERMINED FROM READINGS ON THE DISCHARGE LEASE AUTOMATIC  CUSTODY TRANSFER (LACT) METER. METER START FIGURE WAS 0 BARRELS, METER END FIGURE WAS 260 BARRELS, MINUS THE EXISTING CONTENTS OF THE TRAILERS (WITNESSED BY DFG-OSPR) OF 211 BARRELS, EQUALS APPROXIMATELY 49 BARRELS. THIS QUANITFICATION WAS PERFORMED BY CALIFORNIA  DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME-OFFICE OF SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE (OSPR) OIL SPILL PREVENTION SPECIALIST ED BOYES IN CONCURRENCE WITH SCOTT MCGOWAN OF PAN PACIFIC.   CONTRIBUTING SOURCE OF INFORMATION: DALE STIETER, PATRIOT; ED BOYES, DFG-OSPR; SCOTT MCGOWAN, PAN PACIFIC    NO PRE-EXISTING SECONDARY CONTAINMENT STRUCTURES WERE IN PLACE.   CONTRIBUTING SOURCE OF INFORMATION: DALE STRIETER, PATRIOT; DALE SKEEN, BREITBURN ENERGY    THE PATHWAY OF MIGRATION OF THE RELEASE FROM ITS SOURCE (PLEASE SEE PATHWAY MAP IN ATTACHMENT 3): OIL OVERFLOWED FROM THE PULL TRAILER AND IMPACTED THE CONCRETE PAD ON WHICH THE TRUCK WAS PARKED. IT FLOWED OFF THE PAD TO THE LEASE SOUTH FENCE LINE, UNDER THE FENCE TO A DEPRESSION IN THE SOIL. THIS DEPRESSION LED WEST TO THE DRIVEWAY OF THE FACILITY. UPON REACHING THE DRIVEWAY, THE OIL FLOWED SOUTH TO THE GUTTER OF EAST 7TH STREET. THE OIL THEN FLOWED EAST TO THE STORM DRAIN CATCH BASIN ON THE NORTH SIDE OF 7TH STREET AND ENTERED A STORM DRAIN CULVERT. THE OIL THEN FLOWED SOUTH UNDER 7TH STREET AND ENTERED THE STORM DRAIN SYSTEM UNDER THE CITY OF LONG BEACH RECREATION PARK 9-HOLE GOLF COURSE.

BOX 69,LONGVIEW,WA,98632,Carrier,"Dear Mr. Scott:    CCS, A division of PNE Corp. was contracted by Wilcox and Flegel Oil Company to provide response services and mitigation to a gasoline spill involving an overturned tank truck on Hwy 30 near Deer Island, OR. The incident occurred on December 31st , 2010 and CCS was notified at approximately 2125 and asked to respond with resources.    Background:  A fuel tanker operated by Wilcox and Flegel was transporting fuel northbouNd to Hwy 30 during the evening of December 31st, 2010. The truck struck cows which had wandred on to the roadway, the resulting accident ended with the truck being overturned while the trailer unit remained upright and connected. ODOT and Columbia River Fire and Rescue (CRFR) closed Hwy 30 in both directions until the accident could be cleared and when safe to do so. Wilcox and Flegel requested CCS resources to contain the spill and mitigate further impact from Gasoline into the environment.     Response:  CCS arrived on-site at approximately 10:45 in the evening and met with Wilcox and Flegel and the Incident Commander from CRFR. An initial plan was developed to perform reconnaissance of the scene to determine appropriate strategies. The gasoline tanker was noted to be releasing 5 gallons per minute from each of two locations on the tanker. The first on the driver side of the tank, this leak was emanating from a tear in the aluminum tank. The second leak was from the strong back hatch cover on the forward compartment.     CCS evaluted strategies for containment and recovery of remaining fuel in the tank, it was determined that the best and most effective method would be to drill the tanker allowing access to each of the two compartments. A vacuum truck was standing by to receive gasoline. CCS performed a safety briefing with all personnel and outlined the operational plan for fuel access and removal. It ws determined that the scne was not safe for operations due to the presence of gasoline on the ground surface and unimpeded leaking of gasoline. CCS requested that CRFR place foam over the impacted area prior to entry operations. When the foam was in-place, CCS Began with setting up operations for the drilling.    CCS utilized a nitrogen supplied air drill and a 3"" hole saw for drilling the tanker. Grounding and bonding lines were setup and the equipment and setup was analyzed prior to drilling. CCS placed a containment pool underneath the forward leaking hatch while drilling the rear compaRtment. Once the rear compartment wAs drilled, CCS then drilled the forward compartment and removed remaining fuel. All fuel remaining in the compartments were removed totaling 3,072 gallons. CCS then began with assisting in the offloading of contents in the trailer (Diesel fuel) to Wilcox provided trucks.

ACTIONS TAKEN:  THE DRIVER CLOSED THE TRAILER DOOR AND THEN CALLED THE CARRIER (LAKEVILLE MOTOR EXPRESS) AND REPORTED THE RELEASE.  THE DRIVER INFORMED THE BUSINESS OWNER OF THE RELEASE.  THE BUSINESS OWNER HAD ACCESS TO A SKID-STEER AND SAND AND WAS ABLE TO PLACE THE SAND ON THE RELEASED PRODUCT ON THE DRIVEWAY TO PREVENT FURTHER MIGRATION OF THE MATERIAL. THE CARRIER CALLED ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, INC., AN  EMERGENCY RESPONSE COMPANY FOR THE CARRIER, AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT DISPATCHED A LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL COMPANY TO PERFORM THE CLEANUP ACTIVITES.

THE CREW ALSO TRANSFERRED THE REMAINING PRODUCT FROM THE IBC INTO THREE DRUMS.  THE THREE DRUMS WERE SENT FOR RE-USE.  A STORM DRAIN WAS IMPACTED BY THE RELEASED PRODUCT AND WAS FLUSHED BY THE CLEANUP CREW.  THE RINSE WATER WAS ALSO COLLECTED, STAGED FOR DISPOSAL.

The liquid line valve was found partially open (1/2 inch turn to fully close) and liquid was dripping from around this line's dust cap or closure cap. Responder deduced that the wire tie down applied did not prevent vibration from opening the wheeled valve handle.

They stop driver in a pull out areaalong CO 330/65. A decision from the home office was to send out a third party with fork-lift to set tote properly back on trailer. Fork-Lift operator slide the forks underneath the tote to reposition the mineral oil and punctured the other tote on the opposite side. Immediately hands took the damage tote off the trailer and position it to stop leaking. Chemical ran less than 3 minutes spilling approx 125 gallons. BJ hands place absorbents on ground and damn up the liquid so it would not run into a local river next to the road.  A CDOT employee arrived on scene and declared he was in control and did not want BJ to finish transferring and removing the spill. With all of the proper documentation and information provided he would not listen and declared the roadway be shut down. At this time Plateau Valley Fire department arrived and the  HazMat and Colorado State patrol called. 3 hours later the HazMat team showed arrived because they had not been dispatched initially.
