I WENT DOWN RECEIVED THE BILL, CHECKED THE HAZMAT INFORMATION AND BECAUSE IT WAS A CLASS 9 MOSQUITO REPELLENT I OPENED THE DOOR TO INVESTIGATE THE SPILL. I SEEN LIQUID POURING OUT OF A DRUM. I WALKED INTO THE TRAILER TURNED THE DRUM OVER TO STOP THE LEAK CAME OUT OF THE TRAILER PULLED THE DOOR DOWN AND IMMEDITLY CHECKED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE HAND BOOK. I THEN CALLED OUR HAZ MAT EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM DOTHAN AND TALKED WITH EDDIE YANCE. I GAVE HIM ALL THE INFORMATION AND THEN FOLLOWED HIS INSTRUCTIONS. THIS WAS AT 20:00 HOURS. HIS INSTRUCTIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS. 1) CONTAINE THE SPILL ON THE YD THAT WAS LEAKING OUT OF THE TRAILER WIT SAND. AND ABSORBENT. 2) CALL THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE # ON THE BILL AND GET A SAFETY DATA SHEET. FAX TO ME. 3) COORDINATE WITH HAPECO , THE HAZMAT CLEAN UP CREW AT THE CLEAN UP PROCESS. I FOLLOWED THESE INSTRUCTIONS. HAPECO CONTACTED ME AT APPROX. 20:45 HOURS. THEY WERE HERE CLEANING AT 21:00 HOURS AND WERE FINISHED BY 23:00 HOURS. THEY SUGGESTED THAT THE TRAILER AIR UOT FOR A DAY AND THEN BE STEAMED CLEANED. HAPECO INFORMATION INCLUDING PICTURES, WILL BE SENT DIRECTLY TO EDDIE YANCE. AFTER ALL THE INITIAL CONTACT WERE MADE I INTERVIEWEDTHOMAS LESSING, THE EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HAZMAT SPILL. HE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T THINK HE WAS THAT CLOSE TO THE DRUM. ONE OF HIS BLADES WAS STICKING OUT OF THE SKID HE WAS LOADING BEHIND THESE DRUMS AND HE PUNCTURED THE DRUM WITH THE END OF THE BLADE. THOMAS HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED SEVERAL TIME TO USE DUNNAGE WHEN LOADING AROUND DRAMS. HE FAILED TO DO SO THIS TIME. I EX PLANED THE IMPORTANCE OF USING EXTREME CAUTION WHEN DEALING WITH HAZMAT AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO USE DUNNAGE EACH AND EVERY TIME HE LOAD AROUND THEM. I EXPLAINED ALL THE COAST THAT WAS GOING TO BE INVOLVED BECAUSE OF HIS EXPENSIVE MISTAKE. AFTER I WAS SURE HE UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THIS I INSTRUCTED HIM OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTION HE WOULD RECEIVE. 1ST) HE WILL PUNCH OFF THE CLOCK FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY. 2ND) HE WOULD RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY OFF WITHOUT PAY. 3RD) IF HE IN THE FUTURE, IS INVOLVED IN ANOTHER LOADING OR UNLOADING MISTAKE LIKE THIS HE WILL BE SUBJECTED TOO MORE TIME OFF WITHOUT PAY UP TO TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.",,No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,US,

THE DRIVER, DAVE EMERT, WAS TRAVELING EAST BOUND ON I-68 WHEN HE WAS BLINDED BY THE SUN. WHEN DAVE GOT HIS SIGHT BACK HE REALIZED HE WAS TOO FAR OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND COULD NOT ADJUST. BOTH THE TRUCK AND THE TRAILER TURNED OVER. THE TRAILER WAS FILLED WITH NINE TOTES OF THE SILICONE LIQUIDS. LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE BROUGHT TO THE SCENE IMMEDIATELY. AT 8:00 AM LIBERTY INSURANCE WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT THE INCIDENT. AT 9:30 AM AN ADJUSTER FROM CRAWFORD AND CO. ARRIVED AT THE SCENE. AROUND 10:30 AM A CLEAN UP COMPANY WERE CONTACTED TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL. THE DRIVER WAS IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDED FOR 10 DAYS AND RE-TRAINED ON SPEED AND SPACE MANAGEMENT.

DOW CORNING IS AWARE ON THE SEAL/GASKET PROBLEM AND THEY WILL TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO CORRECT THE SEAL/GASKET PROBLEM ON THEIR END. HARRY OWEN TRUCKING IS WORKING WITH EACH OF ITS DRIVER TO ENSURE THAT ANY LOAD A DRIVER ACCEPTS MUST BE PROPERLY LOADED AND BRACED. THE CAUSE OF SPILL WAS TWO FOLD: 1) HARRY OWEN TRUCKING DRIVER USING POOR JUDGEMENT AND DRIVING SKILLS. THE DRIVER AND HARRY OWEN TRUCKING TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE INITIAL ACCIDENT. THE TIPPING OF THE TRUCK WAS DUE TO DIFFERENT FACTORS; SUNLIGHT, POOR REACTION BY HARRY OWEN TRUCKING DRIVER AND NO ROOM ON SHOULDER FOR DRIVER TO CORRECT HIS MISTAKE. 2) IMPROPER SEALING OF THE IBC TOTES. BASED UPON THE SITE INVESTIGATION THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION THE LEAKAGE FORM THE CONTAINERS WAS DUE TO IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE SEAL/ GASKETS ON THE CONTAINERS. IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT EIGHT OF THE NINE BUNGS ON THE CONTAINERS WERE TIGHTENED. ONCE THE BUNGS WERE TIGHTENED THE CONTAINERS WERE SENT BACK TO DOW CORNING CORPORATION IN CARROLLTON, KY.

HAD A SPILL OF 250 GALLONS OF SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE(10%) AT 3800 LEXINGTON, HIGHLAND PARK, TEXAS.  THIS WAS AT A CITY POOL. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED AND MY DRIVER CALLED ME IMMEDIATELY. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT MADE A SMALL DAM FROM SOME CHEMICAL THEY HAD (SODIUM BICARB?) TO STOP ANY FURTHER CHLORINE FROM ENTERING THE STORM SEWER. WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE SCENE THEY HAD ALREADY LEFT, LEAVING A POLICE OFFICER TO MONITOR ANY TRAFFIC AND CLEAN UP. WE USED THIOSULFATE TO NEUTRALIZE THE CHLORINE.  WE USED SAND TO SOAK UP THE CHLORINE THEN SHOVELED IT INTO A CONTAINMENT TANK.  CONTAINMENT TANK WAS BROUGHT BACK TO DCC, WHERE WE WILL FURTHER NEUTRALIZE OR BALANCE PH THEN DISPOSE OF THE PH BALANCED AND NEUTRALIZED WATER THROUGH SEWER DRAIN AND SAND WILL BE USED ON OUR LOT. WE ALSO MIXED SEVERAL TEN GALLON BUCKETS(A TOTAL OF ABOUT 30 POUNDS) OF SODIUM THIOSULFATE WHICH WAS POURED INTO THE STORM DRAIN TO HELP NEUTRALIZE THE CHLORINE, WHICH ACCIDENTALLY MAY HAVE ENTERED INTO THE STORM DRAIN. WHEN I CONTACTED TNRCC THE NEXT MORNING, LAURIE WOOTEN ASKED ME TO CHECK THE SPILL THIS MORNING AND SEND YOU MY REPORT. UPON GOING BACK THE NEXT MORNING I TOOK CHLORINE AND P-H TESTS APPROXIMATELY  EVERY 500 FEET FOR ABOUT A MILE.  THESE RESULTS WERE FOR THE FIRST APPROXIMATELY 4 TENTHS OF A MILE.  PH 7.6 TO 8.0, CHLORINE LEVEL AT ZERO.  AT ABOUT 1/2 MILE DROPS TO 7.6 TO 7.4 AND ZERO CHLORINE.  AT FITZHUGH STREET APPROXIMATELY PH DROPS TO 7.3 AND ZERO CHLORINE. UNFORTUNATELY DURING MY WALK DOWN THE CREEK I DID NOTICE ABOUT 60 DEAD CATFISH APPROXIMATELY TWO TO FOUR INCHES LONG. LATER IN THE DAY THE TOWN OF HIGHLAND PARK INFORMED US THAT A CITY MAIN HAD BEEN BROKEN AND A MAN WHO RAISED FISH IN HIS FISH POND HAD OPENED A VALVE UPSTREAM AND RELEASED SOME DEAD FISH.

THE RELEASE OCCURRED ON ROUTE 12 IN BATON ROUGE, LA (INCIDENT #99-4263.) THE BF3 GAS RELEASED ON AUGUST 2, 1999 WAS MANUFACTURED BY ALLIEDSIGNAL IN MARCUS HOOK,   PA. A MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEET (MSDS) FOR BF3 IS ATTACHED.  THE BF3 WAS BEING TRANSPORTED AS A COMPRESSED GAS FROM MARCUS HOOK, PA TO BEAUMONT, TX IN TUBE TRAILER TT-849 BY QUALITY CARRIERS (FORMERLY CHEMICAL LEAMAN).  TT-849 IS EQUIPPED WITH SIX (6) TUBES MANIFOLDED TOGETHER. DURING TRANSPORTATION ON AUGUST 2, THE CONTENTS OF EACH TUBE WERE PHYSICALLY ISOLATED BY CLOSED VALVES.  THE SOURCE OF THE RELEASE WAS FROM TUBE 5 ON TT-849.  THE TUBE IS EQUIPPED WITH A BULL PLUG ASSEMBLY AT EACH END.  EACH BULL PLUG ASSEMBLY INCLUDES A SAFETY RELIEF CLUSTER TO  PREVENT A CATASTROPHIC RELEASE DUE TO EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURE AND OVERPRESSURIZATION. EACH BULL PLUG ASSEMBLY IS ATTACHED TO THE TUBE BY THREADING IT IN WITH STRAIGHT-TYPE THREADS.  AN O-RING PROVIDES A PRESSURE-SEAL BETWEEN THE TUBE AND THE BULL PLUG ASSEMBLY. AT APPROXIMATELY 1:00 PM ON AUGUST 2, 1999, AS TT-849 WAS TRAVELING WEST ON ROUTE 12 IN BATON ROUGE, LA, THE QUALITY CARRIERS DRIVER NOTICED A LEAK OF BF3 GAS COMING FROM THE TUBE TRAILER AND REPORTEDLY STOPPED.  THE BATON ROUGE FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED, AND AS A SAFETY PRECAUTION, THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS SET UP WATER SPRAYS OVER TT-849 (THE BF3 WOULD  HAVE REACTED IMMEDIATELY WITH THE HUMIDITY IN THE AIR).  THE LOUISIANA STATE POLICE ALSO RESPONDED, CLOSING A SECTION OF ROUTE 12 AND EVACUATING THE AREA IN A 1/4 MILE RADIUS INCLUDING 11 HOMES. ALLIEDSIGNAL PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THE SCENE FROM ITS FACILITIES IN BATON ROUGE AND GEISMAR, LA, AND MARCUS HOOK, PA.  REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE U.S. EPA AND LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY(DEQ) ALSO RESPONDED TO THE SCENE.  ALLIEDSIGNAL REPORTED THE RELEASE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AND WAS ASSIGNED REPORT #493587.  THE LOUISIANA STATE POLICE ASSIGNED INCIDENT #99-4263. THE BF3 GAS WAS LEAKING FROM THE TUBE 5 ON TT-849 FROM THE BULL PLUG ASSEMBLY AT THE MANIFOLDED END OF TUBE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 5:40 AM ON AUGUST 3, 1999, ALLIEDSIGNAL PERSONNEL STOPPED THE LEAK BY SEALING THE BULL PUG ASSEMBLY WITH DEVCON(LIQUID STEEL).  AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00 AM, THE REMAINING CONTENTS OF TUBE 5 (EXCEPT FOR SOME RESIDUAL BF3 GAS AT A PRESSURE OF 0 PSIG) WERE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER TUBE TRAILER (TT-701). SHORTLY THEREAFTER, TUBE TRAILERS TT-849 AND TT-701 WERE TRANSPORTED TO ALLIEDSIGNAL'S FACILITY IN BATON ROUGE, LA, AND THE LOUISIANA STATE POLICE ENDED THE EVACUATION OF THE AREA AND RE-OPENED ROUTE 12.  LATE IN THE EVENING ON AUGUST 3, TUBE TRAILERS TT-849 AND TT-701 WERE TRANSPORTED TO ALLIEDSIGNAL'S FACILITY IN GEISMAR, LA, AND AS OF THIS WRITING ARE STILL PRESENT AT THAT LOCATION.
