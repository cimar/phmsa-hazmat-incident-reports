FAULCON GOT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE TANK CONTAINED 3488 GALLONS OF FUEL.  MR. FAULCON DID NOT GAUGE THE TANK PRIOR TO OFF LOADING BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THERE WAS ENOUGH ROOM FOR THE 2000 GALLONS OF FUEL.  WHILE OFF LOADING MR. FAULCON STATED THAT HE OBSERVED FUEL COMING FROM THE VENT PIPE.  OBSERVATIONS ON SITE ALSO INDICATE THAT FUEL ESCAPED FROM THE MANWAYS ALSO.  THE AMOUNT OF FUEL THAT WAS SPILT APPEARS TO BE ABOUT 60-75 GALLONS.  MR. FAULCON IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE FUEL FLOW WHEN HE OBSERVED THE OVER FILL.  A&A ENVIRONMENTAL WAS NOTIFIED AND RESPONDED TO PERFORM THE CLEAN UP.  I SPOKE TO MR.

I ALSO SPOKE TO DONALD PUSEY, PLANT MANAGER OF THE FEED MILL, AND HE STATED THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE THE FUEL WAS ORDERED UNTIL THE OVERFILL OCCURRED.  MR. FAULCON DID NOT HAVE A TANK CHART IN HIS VEHICLE SO MR. PUSEY PROVIDED HIM WITH A COPY.  MR FAULCON WAS INSTRUCTED THAT THE TANK MUST BE GAUGED PRIOR TO OFF LOADING TO ENSURE AN INCIDENT OF THIS NATURE DOES NOT OCCUR AGAIN.  MR.

THE TRUCK WAS OFF LOADED ON THE 17TH AT SUPERIOR SPECIAL SERVICES, INC. FACILITY IN PLANT CITY, FL AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00 AM. AFTER UNLOADING THE DRIVER LEFT THE FACILITY WITH THIS TRUCK TO BEGIN HIS NEXT SCHEDULED ROUTE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 12:15 P.M., A FACILITY TECHNICIAN WAS PREPARING TO TRANSFER THE PACKAGE CONTAINING THE BOTTLES OF ELEMENTAL MECURY TO THE MECURY DEVICE STORAGE ROOM. IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING THE PACKAGE, HE NOTICED A BEAD OF ELEMENTAL MERCURY ON THE WOODEN PALLET CARRYING THE PACKAGE.  HE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED RALPH MANN, OPERATIONS MANAGER.  THE MERCURY WAS THEN CLEANED OF THE PALLET USING A MERCURY VACUUM.  THE CONTENTS OF THE PACKAGE WERE INSPECTED TO ASCERTAIN THE SOURCE OF THE SPILLED MERCURY.  A 4 OZ. PLASTIC BOTTLE CONTAINED IN THE PACKAGE WAS FOUND TO BE EMPTY.  CLOSER INSPECTION OF THIS CONTAINER REVEALED A CRACK IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BOTTLE.  ALL OTHER CONTAINERS APPEARED TO BE INTACT AN DNON-LEAKING.  THE IMMEDIATE AEA OF THE PLANT WAS ALSO CLEANED WITH THE VACUUM.  AN INSPECTION OF HTE FACILITY REVEALED THAT SEVERAL BEADS OF MERCURY WERE PRESENT AT THE BASE OF THE RAMP IN THE LOADING DOCK AREA.  THIS AREAWAS ALSO CLEANED FOLLOWING THE SAME PROCEDURES AS WERE USED IN CLEANING THE PLANT.  AIRMONITORING WAS PERFORMED WITH THE JEROME MERCURY VAPOR ANALYZER.  RESULTS OF THE AIR MONITORING ARE ATTACHED.  SINCE THE EXACT TIME OF THE PACKAGE FAILURE WAS NOT KNOWN, THE DRIVER WAS CONTACTED AND INSTRUCTED TO IMMEDIATELY RETURN TO THE PLANT.  UPON ARRIVAL THE TRUCK WAS INSPECTED FOR THE PRESENCE ON MERCURY.  THIS INSPECTION REVEALED THAT THE PACKAGE FAILURE OCCURED EITHER IN THE TRUCK OR PRIOR TO LOADING.  BON SECOR HOSPITAL WAS NOTIFIED AND INSTRUCTED TO INSPEC THEIR STORAGE AREA FOR SIGNS OF SPILLAGE.  THEY REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF SPILLAGE IN THEIR STORAGE AREA.  MEANWHILE, FACILITY PERSONNEL UNLOADED AND CLEANED THE TRUCK.  AIR MONITORING WAS PERFORMED IN THE TRUCK TO VERIFY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CLEANING.  LATER THE TRUCK WAS CLEANED AGAIN USING A MERCURY SPILL CLEAN UP PRODUCT CALLED ""HGX"".  BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL RECOVERED FROM THE PALLET AND PLANT AREA, THE LOADING DOCK, AND INSIDE THE TRUCK, IT APPEARED THAT LESS THAN ONE POUND OF MERCURY WAS RELEASED FROM THE PACKAGE.

OUR MARINE DEPARTMENT CONTACTED THE PORT OF HOUSTON FIRE DEPARTMENT BEFORE THE TANK WAS MOVED TO 113.  THE PORT PUT A POP-UP POOL UNDERNEATH THE TANK TO KEEP ANY PRODUCT FROM LEAKING ONTO THE GROUND.  THE POH FIRE DEPARTMENT TIGHTENED LOOSE NUTS AND BOLTS AROUND THE FLANGE/VALVE.  THIS APPEARED TO STOP THE LEAK.  WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE SCENE THE TANK APPEARED TO STOP LEAKING.  THE PORT OF HOUSTON SECURITY WAS ALSO ON SCENE.  I CALLED NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 3:40P.M.

ALSO APPEARED TO HAVE A FINE HAIRLINE WELD CRACK BY THE VALVE WHERE THE LEAK HAD OCCURRED.  CMS INTERMODAL TEAM BROUGHT IN A NEW VALVE/CAP, GASKET AND REPLACED WITHOUT ANY LEAKS. THE TANK WAS LIFTED OFF THE STEVEDORING CHASSIS AND PLACED ONTO CMS INTERMODAL DROP DECK FRAME.  THE TANK WAS REMOVED FROM THE TERMINAL AT 7:45 P.M.  APPROXIMATELY TWO GALLONS HAD LEAKED OUT OF THE TANK. ABSORBENT HAD BEEN PLACED ON THE GROUND UNDER THE POP-UP POOL.

THIS CUSTOMER DOES NOT HAVE A DOCK TO UNLOAD, SO YOU MUST UNLOAD DIRECTLY OFF THE BACK OF YOUR TRAILER.  UPON ARRIVAL, OUR DRIVER WAS INSTRUCTED TO PROCEED TO THE GAVELED LOT DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE CONTAINMENT AREA IN THE REAR OF THE PLANT.  HE WOULD BE MET THERE BY A FORKLIFT OPERATOR TO TAKE THEM OFF.  AT APPROXIMATELY 12:05 PM, OUR DRIVER OPENED THE REAR DOOR OF THE TRAILER, ENTERED THE TRAILER, AND PROCEEDED TO PULL THE FIRST TOTE BACK ABOUT 10 FEET WITH A HAND JACK.  AFTER HE LOWERED THE TOTE DOWN, HE PULLED THE HAND JACK OUT AND WENT TO THE FRONT OF THE TOTE AND JACKED IT BACK UP.  AT THIS POINT HE STARTED TO PUSH THE TOTE TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER.  THE TRAILER HAS A 3 FOOT STEEL PLATE AT THE REAR OF THE TRAILER WHICH IS ABOUT 1/4""  THICK, WHICH REQUIRES YOU TO PUSH THE HAND JACK HARD ENOUGH TO GET THE TOTE AND HAND JACK ON TOP OF THE PLATE.  IT IS AT THIS TIME THE FORKLIFT OPERATOR CAN REACH THE TOTES AND TAKE THEM OFF THE BACK END OF THE TRAILER.  AS HE PUSHED THE TOTE TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER, HE FELT THE HAND JACK JUMP ON THE STEEL PLATE, SO HE STOPPED PUSHING AND GRABBED THE RELEASE HANDLE TO LOWER THE TOTE. BEFORE THE HAND JACK DROPPED THE TOTE, THE TWO FRONT WHEELS OF THE HAND JACK DROPPED OFF THE REAR OF THE 3-FOOT STEEL PLATE  CAUSING THE TOTE TO SLIDE OFF THE HAND JACK AND HIT THE GROUND. WHEN THE TOTE HIT THE GROUND IT SPLIT OPEN ON THREE SIDES SPILLING THE ENTIRE CONTENTS ONTO THE GRAVEL LOT.
