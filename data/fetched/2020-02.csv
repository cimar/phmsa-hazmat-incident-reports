The employee moved drums and determined there were two 55 gallon drums that had punctures at the bottom edge of the drums. One drum contained nonhazardous material and the other drum contained the UN2735, Waste Amines Liquid, Corrosive,  n.o.s. hazardous waste material. The drum containing the hazardous was the original manufacturer's  packaging and appeared to be in good condition when it was accepted for transportation. The total amount spilled was approximately 2 liquid gallons. The spill was contained within the trailer and was  cleaned up by Veolia employees using absorbent pads, vermiculite and speedy dry. Both of the leaking drums were overpacked into 95 gallon drums so they could be safely shipped with any further incidents. It was determined that the drums became punctured from a drum cart while being loaded onto the  trailer.",To mitigate this type of incident from occurring again Veolia will review the spill in the next weekly  training meeting on 2/19/2020.

He notified the Brewster Yardmaster who then called myself, John Vergis hazardous Materials/environmental Officer for the WLE.  I cam out to investigate to find that the Vapor Valve was leaking through the valve plug.  I also found that the valve was not shut tightly.  I tightened the valve handle and the leak stopped.  I them tightened the valve plug which ws only hand tight.  i then checked the liquid valves and although the handles we tight and not leaking, the valve plug were only hand tight so I tightened them with a tool.  I then leased the car for transportation.  During this process, the switching lead has to be shut down to traffic since this car was in close proximity of the lead.

As a result, approximately three(3) gallons released to the trailer floor and outside the trailer to the concrete surface. At approximately 9:45 a.m. CST, a representative from RL retained Cura Emergency Services, L.C.(CES) to manage the environmental remediation of the site on their behalf. Based on the available information, the CES incident manager dispatched a crew from Environmental Restoration, LLC. (ER) to assess and remediate the site as necessary. A crew from ER arrived onsite. Following a site assessment, crews utilized simple green to neutralize the trailer. ER personnel deployed granular absorbents to the amines liquid corrosive impacted concrete surface and swept them in with hand tools. Crews then deployed granular absorbents to the trailer floor and swept them in with hand tools. All amines liquid corrosive impacted material was collected and containerized into one(1) 55-gallon drum for transport and disposal. ER personnel overpacked the amines liquid corrosive impacted drum into one(1) 95-gallon drum to be returned to the point of origin.

He hooked-up his tanker hose to the customer’s acid tank. He also hooked-up a vent hose going from the truck to a plastic 55 gallon drum. After determining everything was hooked up properly, the driver started the transfer. The driver subsequently observed foam being released from the vent hose onto the floor. The driver immediately stopped the transfer. He inspected both fittings (the tank and the truck) and determined that one of the seals needed changed. He changed the seal to the truck's fitting, and then finished the tank transfer with no further issues. The release lasted about seven to ten minutes and approximately twenty gallons of product was released onto the concrete floor. The release happened in a contained area and absorbent mats were used to clean-up the product on the floor. It was determined that air got into the line through a bad connection. The tank had a plastic fitting on it that was somewhat worn. The tanker had a stainless steel fitting on it and the plastic fitting wouldn't consistently seal properly.",Heritage Transport and Republic Conduit management worked together on the investigation and corrective actions to prevent any future occurrences.Republic Conduit replaced the plastic fitting on their tank with a stainless steel fitting.
