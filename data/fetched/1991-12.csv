THE PACKAGES CONTAINED AIRCRAFT PAINT AND A CHEMICAL THAT IS USED IN APPLICATION OF THE PAINT.  THERE WERE NO HAZMAT LABELS AFFIXED TO EITHER BOX.  THE SHIPMENT CONTAINED AN INVOICE FROM AEROFLAIR WITH ORDERS TO SHIP TO WESTAIR. THE AGENT WHO RECEIVED THE SHIPMENT AFFIXED A ""COMAT"" STICKER TO BOTH PACKAGES AND PLACED THEM ON A FLIGHT TO SAN FRANCISCO AT WHICH POINT A CONNECTION TO FRESNO WOULD BE MADE.  AT SAN FRANCISCO, THE SHIPMENT WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER AIRCRAFT AND FLOWN TO FRESNO.  DURING THIS FLIGHT, ONE OF THE CONTAINERS DEVELOPED A LEAK.  UPON ARRIVAL IN FRESNO, THE AGENT WHO OPENED THE CARGO DOOR OF THE AIRCRAFT NOTICED FUMES ESCAPING FROM THE PACKAGE.  HE REMOVED THE PACKAGE AND NOTIFIED THE AIRCRAFT CREW.  THE AIRPORT FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ALSO CALLED.  THERE WAS NO FIRE NOR WAS THERE ANY DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT OR OTHER BAGGAGE/CARGO. WESTAIR MAINTAINS A POLICY OF NOT CARRYING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF LIMITED QUANTITIES OF DRY ICE, CERTAIN MEDICAL SHIPMENTS AND WHEEL CHAIR BATTERIES.  WESTAIR'S PRIMARY SERVICE OF BUSINESS IS PASSENGERS.  GROUND AND FLIGHT PERSONNEL ARE TRAINED IN RECOGNITION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND ARE SUPPOSED TO ENSURE THAT SUCH SHIPMENTS ARE NOT LOADED ON AIRCRAFT.  THE PRIMARY MEANS OF RECOGNITION IS THE D.O.T. LABEL. THE AGENT IN SANTA MARIA WAS TRAINED ON HAZMAT AND HIS LAST TEST WAS ON JUNE 12, 1991. SINCE NO LABELS WERE AFFIXED TO THE TWO BOXES, THE AGENT WAS NOT ALERTED TO THE NATURE OF THE CONTENTS.  SINCE THE SHIPMENT WAS AT THE REQUEST OF THE COMPANY PURCHASING DEPARTMENT, THIS FURTHER CAUSED THE AGENT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO LOAD IT ON THE AIRCRAFT.  DURING THE TRANSFER IN SAN FRANCISCO, THERE WAS NO OBSERVATION OF LEAKAGE OR ANY PROBLEM AND, ONCE AGAIN, THE TWO BOXES APPEARED TO BE TYPICAL ""COMAT"" SHIPMENTS.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THEIR POSITION IN THE CARGO COMPARTMENT DURING THE FLIGHT FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO FRESNO CAUSED THE CONTENTS OF ONE BOX TO SHIFT AND THE LEAKAGE THEN OCCURRED. THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE AIRCRAFT AT 20:30 ON DECEMBER 26, 1991.  A TELEPHONE REPORT WAS MADE TO THE FAA BURLINGAME FSDO THE NEXT MORNING.  PERSONNEL WERE NOT AWARE THE BURLINGAME FSDO COULD RECEIVE SUCH A REPORT AT NIGHT.  THEY ARE NOT AWARE AND ANY FUTURE INCIDENTS WILL RESULT IN THE TELEPHONE REPORT BEING MADE IMMEDIATELY. A SHIPPER IN SANTA MARIA IS AN AIRCRAFT PAINT SHOP THAT HAS HAD A LONG-STANDING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY.  THIS PAINT SHOP HAD, IN THE PAST, SHIPPED AIRCRAFT PARTS AND OTHER NON HAZARDOUS ITEMS ON COMPANY FLIGHTS.  THIS PARTICULAR SHIPMENT WAS MADE IN THE ORIGINAL BOX THAT THE PAINT WAS DELIVERED IN AND THE SHIPPER BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS AN APPROPRIATE CONTAINER FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE.
