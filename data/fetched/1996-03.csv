UPON ARRIVAL AT THE LOADING SITE, THE DRIVER INITIATED THE STEPS NECESSARY TO BEGIN THE LOADING PROCEDURES. ONE STEP IN THIS PROCEDURE INVOLVES THE OPENING OF THE DRAIN VALVES OF THE VEHICLE'S SCRUBBER SYSTEM AND VACUUM PUMP ASSEMBLY IN ORDER TO DRAIN ANY RESIDUAL LIQUID THAT COULD HAVE COLLECTED IN THESE SYSTEMS FROM A PREVIOUS SHIPMENT.  THE DRIVER PERFORMED THIS STEP AND CLOSED THE DRAIN VALVE AFTER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SYSTEMS CONTAINED NO RESIDUAL LIQUID.  ONCE THE SETUP AND INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE WAS COMPLETE, THE DRIVER ENGAGED THE VACUUM PUMP IN ORDER TO INITIATE THE LOADING OF PRODUCT INTO THE TANK.  IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT APPROXIMATELY 1 PINT OF MATERIAL ESCAPED FROM THE EXHAUST STACK OF THE SCRUBBER SYSTEM ONTO THE ASPHALT CONTAINMENT LOADING AREA.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE OPERATION AND NOTIFIED BOTH THE MANAGEMENT OF CUSTOM CAPTIVE AND HIS HOME DISPATCHER OF THE INCIDENT. A CLEAN UP CREW WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE AND UPON ARRIVAL, PROCEEDED TO ABSORB ALL FREE LIQUIDS WITH SUITABLE ABSORBENT PADS.  THIS MATERIAL WAS CONTAINERIZED AND SENT FOR DISPOSAL TO A LICENSED WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITY.  A REVIEW OF THE INCIDENT INDICATED THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO MATERIAL FROM A PREVIOUS LOAD FREEZING IN THE EXHAUST STACK OF THE SCRUBBER SYSTEM.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE PRESSURE CREATED WHEN THE VACUUM UNIT WAS TURNED ON DISLODGED AN ICE PLUG ALLOWING RESIDUAL LIQUID BEHIND THE ICE PLUG TO ESCAPE FROM THE EXHAUST STACK.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE FORMATION OF AN ICE PLUG PREVENTED THE DRIVER FROM DISCOVERING THE PRESENCE OF RESIDUAL LIQUID IN THESE SYSTEMS DURING HIS INITIAL INSPECTION.  IN ORDER TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE, THE DRIVER HAS BEEN RE-INSTRUCTED TO ENSURE THAT ALL SCRUBBER UNITS ARE DRAINED COMPLETELY PRIOR TO SUBSEQUENT DISPATCH.",,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1300,,US,

WYOMING EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY RECEIVED A CALL AT 1330 HOURS NOTIFYING A SPILL, AND IN TURN CONTACTED THE SHIPPER AND THE CARRIER.  THE SHIPPER REQUESTED STATE RESPONSE TEAM BE PUT ON STANDBY.  THE TEAM CHECKED IN BY 1430 HOURS.  WE DECIDED NOT TO ACTIVATE THE ENTIRE TEAM BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT FROM HIGHWAY PATROL ON THE SCENE.  INSTEAD WE DECIDED TO RESPOND WITH TWO PERSONNEL TO ARRIVED IN LARAMIE THE SAME TIME AS THE CLEANUP TEAM FROM THE SHIPPER.  THEY ARRIVED AT 1900 HOURS AT PETRO TRUCK STOP.  THERE WAS TWO AIR/SEA CONTAINERS ON A FLATBED SEMI-TRAILER.  CONTAINER #1, ON THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER, HAD A TOTAL LOAD WEIGHT OF 9,095 LBS.  TOTAL AMOUNT OF RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL WAS 0.594 MCI.  CONTAINER #2, DIRECTLY IN BACK OF CONTAINER #1, HAD A LOAD WEIGHT OF 7.730 LBS.  TOTAL AMOUNT OF RADIOLOGICAL MATERIAL WAS 0.505 MCI.  THE LOAD ITSELF CONTAINED ONLY TRACE AMOUNTS OF U-238; TC-99; NP-237, PU-239.  WE WERE UNABLE TO DETECT ANY RADIATION COMING FROM THE OIL LEAKING OUT OF THE TRAILER OR ANYWHERE ELSE. WE ALSO DETERMINED THE LEAK IN THE TRAILER WAS COMING FROM THE SECOND CONTAINER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIGHT SIDE.  TWO OF THEIR TEAM MEMBERS SUITED UP.  THEY USED SUITS, BOOTS, AND GLOVES WITH NO BREATHING EQUIPMENT OR HOODS.  THE LOCKHEED TEAM TOOK SEVERAL  SWIPES IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND PUT THEM TO A METER AND WERE UNABLE TO DETECT ANY RADIATION. THEY USED ABSORBENT PADS AND AN OIL ABSORBENT TO CLEAN UP.  ONCE THE OUTSIDE OF THE TRAILER AND THE GROUND WAS CLEANED, THEY  PREPARED THE AREA SO THEYCOULD OPEN THE CONTAINER. THE SEAL ON THE CONTAINER WAS BROKEN AT2054 HOURS.  THE RIGHT CONTAINER DOOR WAS OPENED TO DISCOVER NUMEROUS YELLOW RADIOLOGICCAL  BAGS FILLED WITH  WASTE.  THE TEAM STARTED GOING THROUGH THE BAGS AND FOUND TWO THAT WERE RIPPED OPEN AND CONTAINED OIL. THEY REBAGGED THEM AND ADDED MORE ABSORBING MATERIALTO THE NEW BAG.  THE ORIGINAL LOADING OF THE MATERIAL WAS IMPROPER, BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH ABSORBING MATERIAL IN SEVERAL OF THEM.  CONSEQUENTLY, YOU COULD SEE STANDING LIQUID IN THEM.  ALL OF THOSE BAGS WERE REPACKAGED.   ONCE THEY HAD THE SCENE CLEANED UP,  WE CHECKED THEIR WORK  AND FOUND THEY DID AN ACCEPTABLE JOB IN CLEANING UP THE SPILL.  THE SCENE WAS CLEARED AT APPROXIMATELY 2223 HOURS.  NEXT WE BRIEFED THE TRUCK STOP MANAGEMENT TEAM AT 2333, AND WE DEPARTED FOR CHEYENNE.  WE ARRIVED AT 2400 HOURS. DEATHS AND INJURIES:  NONE REPORTED.  POTENTIAL THREAT: DAMAGE TO PETRO, INC.

HE ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS INSERTING THE TEST THERMCOUPLE INTO THE WELL HOUSING AND BELIEVED THAT THE OBSTRUCTION WAS ON THE REDUCING NUT OR IN THE WELL ITSELF.

THERE WERE NO WARNINGS ON THE RAIL CAR INDICATING THAT THE THERMOWELL WAS REMOVABLE AND COULD RESULT IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE TANK CAR.  THE SERVICEMAN REMOVED WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE A REDUCING NUT OR BUSHING AND COAL TAR PITCH SHOT OUT OF THE ONE INCH OPENING.
