The driver used a hose to remove the fuel from the tank and through partial equipment malfunction and human error the fuel was sucked out of the tank too quickly and spilled onto the ground. Approximately 50 gallons of dyed diesel fuel ran into a storm ditch along the road. The ditch was filled with water from rain in the area and the fuel ran approximately 1000 feet in the ditch. A lake is located at the end of the road but the fuel did not reach the lake. The incident was reported to the State (SCDHEC) and the NRC due to proximity to water. The driver used absorbent pads and boom at the scene initially. The spill responder arrived later that day to remove the product from the ditch via vac truck. The spill responder will remove the soil and test to ensure fuel is removed from the ground.

The UST capacity is 15017 liquid gallons.  The driver made proper connections of vapor recovery hose and product delivery hose.  The driver opened product delivery valve to first click (75 gpm flow rate).  Driver made visual inspection for leakage and found none.  Driver increased gpm flow rate to maximum flow rate of 350 gpm. Within 30 seconds of maximum product flow, driver detected product overflowing the inlet spill capture bucket.  The driver immediately stopped product flow and deployed spill containment materials onto the spilled product.  A small amount of product flowed across a portion of the driveway and across three lanes of roadway (Oracle Road).  Emergency response personnel were contacted.  The emergency response personnel rerouted motor vehicle traffic around the roadway surface that contained the product.  A HM clean up team provided driveway/roadway cleaning.    Later inspection of the UST revealed that the check valve located in the inlet fill tube appeared to be faulty.  The check valve did not open completely as product flowed down the inlet tube.  This obstruction caused the product to ""back up"" the inlet tube and spill from the top of the inlet onto the surface of the driveway.    We have made numerous phone calls to the fire department and AZ DOT to obtain and bills for services rendered.  The authorities have not provided any documents related to the response services.",The underground storage tank equipment should receive a higher level of inspection to assure that the check valve is operating correctly during product unloading into the UST.

While stowing the capped hose in the hose tray of the trailer the driver lost control of the hose causing it to become dislodged at the trailer loading valve. The resulting hose disconnection caused approximately a 30 gallon release of material from within the hose. Dispatch was notified and an in house response crew was summoned. The response crew donned the proper PPE and cleaned the released material. The associated clean up materials were containerized and disposed of properly. The Utah Department of Environmental Quality was notified. Duty operator Morgan provided report #12414.",An internal investigation was conducted and it was determined that the cause of the release was directly related to the failure of the driver to fully clear and control the hose at the conclusion of the loading process. The driver was counselled and retrained on operational procedures relating to vacuum tanker loading / unloading.

Shift Supervisor was called by security that the loaders were trying to contact Armando Arrieta to go to the middle rack and meet with them. Upon reaching the rack Armando met with Eugene Martinez, Isaac Cardenas and a contractor Francisco Lopez.  They explained to Armando that as they were loading the last two cars as one was about to get full they open up the last car and let it fill as they button up the car that just got full. They didn’t realize that the last car was close to getting full itself.  It was Francisco Lopez that first noticed the over fill and let the loaders know what was happening; they closed the valves quickly to prevent more products from spilling. Armando guessed it was about 1 bbl of product on the ground from what Armando could see. Armando notified T. Weick of the situation and he said he would have it cleaned up in the morning. Security was notified not to let the UP remove that car, also Wes Waida was notified of the spill.

AT THE SAME TIME, THE TRANSPORTER OPERATING THE VACUUM UNIT ATTACHED TO HIS CARGO TANK, BUILT UP ENOUGH VACUUM AND OPENED THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CONTAINMENT VALVES AT THE REAR END OF HIS TRAILER, TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF THE WASTE CORROSIVE LIQUID IN TO THE CARGO TANK THROUGH THE TRANSFER HOSE.     UPON THE GENERATOR/LOADER EMPTYING THE GENERATOR TANK, THE LOADER CLOSED THE DISCHARGE VALVES ON THE GENERATORS TANK AND SHUT DOWN THE PUMP. THE LOADER SIGNALED THE DRIVER THAT THE TANK WAS EMPTY. THE TRANSPORTER THEN ALLOWED THE VACUUM PUMP TO OPERATE FOR APPROXIMATELY SIXTY SECONDS OR ENOUGH TIME TO CLEAR TRANSFER HOSE OF ANY PRODUCT OR RESIDUE. THE TRANSPORTER THEN CLOSED THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY CONTAINMENT VALVES AND SHUT DOWN THE VACUUM PUMP.     THE TRANSPORTER THEN CONFIRMED THAT THE TRANSFER HOSE WAS EMPTY BY LIFTING THE HOSE TO CONFIRM THAT THERE WAS NO WEIGHT FROM THE PRODUCT OR RESIDUE REMAINING IN THE HOUSE. HE THEN CAREFULLY BROKE THE TRANSFER HOSE CONNECTION FITTING FROM THE GENERATOR’S DISCHARGE PIPE FITTING TO CONFIRM THAT THERE WAS NO REMAINING PRODUCT IN THE TRANSFER HOUSE.     UPON BREAKING THE CONNECTION AT THE GENERATOR’S DISCHARGE FITTING, THE TRANSPORTER/DRIVER OBSERVED THE PRODUCT SPILLING OUT OF THE HOSE AND IMMEDIATELY DROPPED THE HOSE INTO THE CONTAINMENT AREA GROUND SURFACE GROUND TO AVOID GETTING SPLASHED. TWENTY GALLONS OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCT OR RESIDUE ESCAPED ON TO THE CONTAINMENT AREA FLOOR OR SURFACE.","CHANGES THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE AS A RESULT OF THE SPILL INCLUDE; TRANSPORTERS ARE REQUIRED TO USE AN ADAPTER FITTING BETWEEN THE HOSE CONNECTOR FITTING AND THE GENERATOR’S DISCHARGE PIPER FITTING. THIS ADAPTER FITTING IS INCORPORATED WITH A ONE INCH SHUT OFF VALVE THAT IS TO BE OPENED PRIOR TO THE TRANSPORTER/DRIVER SHUTTING OFF THE VACUUM PUMP. OPERATION OR OPENING OF THIS ONE INCH SHUT OFF VALVE WHILE UNDER VACUUM ALLOWS AIR TO ENTER THE TRANSFER HOSE WHILE IT IS UNDER THE VACUUM, WHICH THEREBY CLEARS THE HOSE OF ANY REMAINING PRODUCT OR RESIDUE.     THE GENERATOR IS REQUIRED TO USE AN ELEVATED TRANSFER HOSE SUPPORT STAND THAT ELEVATES THE TRANSFER HOSE SEVERAL FEET FROM THE GROUND. THIS MINIMIZES THE POSSIBILITY OF THE REMAINING PRODUCT OR RESIDUE IN THE TRANSFER HOSE FROM ESCAPING.     AFTER INTERVIEWING THE DRIVER, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE IS A PROBABILITY THAT THE DRIVER DID NOT ASCERTAIN THAT THE TRANSFER HOSE WAS CLEAR OF ANY REMAINING PRODUCT OR RESIDUE PRIOR TO BREAKING THE TRANSFER HOSE CONNECTION AT THE GENERATOR’S DISCHARGE PIPE. A DECISION HAS BEEN MADE TO RETRAIN OUR DRIVER IN THE OPERATION OF A VACUUM TRAILER WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSOCIATED RISKS RELATIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND SAFETY CONCERNS FOR BOTH THE DRIVER AND THE GENERATOR PERSONNEL. THE DRIVER IS NOT PERMITTED BACK ON THIS SITE UNTIL ADEQUATE, AND ADDITIONAL TRAINING HAS BEEN COMPLETED.     AS THE RESULT OF ANY UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL AND HM-183 CARGO TANK INSPECTION AND TESTING REQUIREMENTS, THE CARRIER HAS REGISTERED THROUGH U.S DOT/FMCSA TO ENGAGE IN THE INSPECTION AND TESTING OF CARGO TANKS. THE CARRIER HAS CONDUCTED AND COMPLETED A POST-INCIDENT INVESTIGATION AND INSPECTION OF OUR CARGO TANK, INCLUDING VACUUM TESTING OF THE EXTERNAL/INTERNAL VALVES OR CAPS, VACUUM VENTS/AIR GAUGE AND DATA DISKS. THE RESULTS OF THIS INSPECTION HAS CONCLUDED THAT WHILE UNDER VACUUM DURING THE INSPECTION PROCESS THAT THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL VALVES HELD VACUUM FOR TWENTY MINUTES.

Upon arrival the morning of Monday October 19, 2015, Santa’s driver was met by a BC Exchange building maintenance employee who identified and unlocked the tank’s covered fill pipe on the sidewalk next to the 36 Center Street entrance of BC Exchange’s building.When asked by the Santa driver if the tank level was low enough to accept a full delivery from the Santa truck, the BC Exchange employee indicated that he had taken a tank level reading on the prior Friday and confirmed that the tank level was low and should be filled with the full load.  To double-check the tank level during filling, the Santa driver relied on the vent whistle located on the wall adjacent to the fill pipe.  While delivering the full 3,259 gallon load of product, the Santa driver continued to hear the confirmatory whistle (indicating remaining capacity in the tank) and observed no odors or other indications of an overfill at his location, outside the building.     After the Santa driver completed this delivery and left the site, BC Exchange employees reported they smelled oil and went into the lower parking garage to investigate, where the maintenance employee found oil coming from under the door to the room where the tank is located and entering a drain outside this utility room.  The BC Exchange Place employee called the Waterbury Fire Department, as well as Santa.  Santa called CTR, a CTDEEP-licensed spill contractor, to assist with the response to the incident. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the fuel oil product came out the pressure relief valve on the top of the tank in the utility room of the building’s lower parking garage. The relief valve and vent whistle do not appear to have operated correctly as they allowed product overflow from the relief valve with no indication of the tank’s full status at the location of the fill and vent pipes and vent whistle, where the driver would have been alerted.  The investigations also determined that the oil entering the garage drain flowed into a concrete catch basin and associated sump pump system connected to the municipal storm sewer.  The sump pump system in BC Exchange’s building is believed to activate automatically.  The storm sewers drain from Center Street to Bank and South Main Streets, into the underground culvert that flows to the outfall on the banks of the Naugatuck River.",On all future deliveries both the driver and the building maintenance personnel will verify the tank level prior to delivery. It was also recommended that an audible and visual high level alarm be installed on the tank in the fill area.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,72241,"Santa Fuel, Inc.",US,

THE DRIVER FAILED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WASH OUT CAP WAS ON TIGHT WHICH CAUSED IT TO COME LOOSE IN TRANSIT.

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT FLUSHED THE STORM DRAIN, BUT LITTLE TO NO ADDITIONAL PRODUCT WAS FOUND TO HAVE COME THROUGH THE DRAIN INTO THE BASIN. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DEPARTED THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 7:30PM, EEI COMPLETED VACUUMING APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER AND THE COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE DEPARTED AT 8:00PM. EEI DID RETURN TO THE JOB SITE TO CLEAN UP AND DISPOSE OF THE OIL-DRY ON OCTOBER 7.

He entered the round-a-bout at the top of the off-ramp with excessive speed. The excessive speed caused the tractor and trailer to roll-over onto the passenger side of the vehicle. The resulting roll-over caused the rear pocket of the trailer to breach because of crushing/abrasion/puncture. This resulted in approx. 705 gallons of diesel fuel to be released slowly onto the roadway. By the time the driver safely exited the vehicle, the County Sheriff Deputy was arriving and within a couple minutes of that, the Suamico Fire Department arrived as well. The fire dept initialized the clean-up. They called a neighboring municipality (Village of Howard) and requested assistance from their street depart that was working nearby with a front end loader and trucks of sand. They were able to contain the majority of the spill on the concrete roadway with the sand and spill booms. A small quantity (less than 50 gallons) entered a storm basin next to the roadway. Within 1.5 hours, an environmental company, SECSI based in Green  Bay arrived to continue with the clean-up. Employees from Garrow Oil & Klemm Tank Lines proceeded to pump off the fuel on the trailer into a 2nd tanker truck. This was completed within 3.5 hours. The truck was then rolled up-right with 2 large tow trucks. The tractor and trailer were then towed to our shop approx. 2 miles away. A second remediation company, North Shore Environmental Construction, based in Germantown, WI arrived within 4 hours to finish the clean-up process. They completed that process by 7 PM that evening. SECSI returned on 10/26/15 to inspect the site one last time and remove some absorbent socks left in the storm basin over the weekend. A SERTS (substance release notification report) was delivered to the Wisconsin DNR on 12/2/15 and the DNR accepted and closed it's SERTS on12/10/15.","Even though we have indented this accident/incident to be an isolated case of errant judgment by our driver of record, nonetheless, we have been accountable to the reality that maybe a gap has opened up within our safety management program. Consequently, a meeting was held with all of our professional operators to review this accident and all the component parts and persons that went to make up this incident, along with the time-line of events leading up to it. Each operator was given an opportunity to visit out-loud about any and all concerns regarding safety at Garrow Oil, and to our surprise, all of the feed back was extremely positive. We again hammered them all on the negative ramifications that can occur when excessive speed is the order of the day. A promise was put forth to all, that prior to the end of the year, the safety department would be doing a ride along with all drivers in order to reconcile skill levels and acumen. Lastly, our operators were told that the safety department would also be doing more visual inspections in the field, with the intention of observing all operators doing everything right.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,94719,GARROW OIL,US,
