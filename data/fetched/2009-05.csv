Car was shipped from local industry, Taminco, Inc., Riverview, MI.      Conrail's A. Richter, Risk Manager, contacted emergency response contractor Eagle Construction, Findlay, OH, to respond due to unavailable response from the shipper.  CR Trainmaster P. Cassettee had the car moved to isolation in the yard's R.I.P. track in the Car Shop area.  Eagle Construction responders arrived at approximately 11pm and inspected the car.    Drip originating from the top of the 4"" bottom outlet valve closure cap.  Examination of operating handle at bottom of car appeared to be in the closed position and was pinned and sealed.  Attempt to slowly remove bottom outlet cap to examine the bottom outlet cap's gasket was stopped due to steady flow of product noted.  Cap resecured tool tight, outlet area wiped down, and valve was watched for a period of approximately 15 minutes, with no further leakage noted.  Leak deemed secure at approximately 11:50pm.    As the bottom outlet valve closure cap's gasket and valve could not be examined during this response, to determine condition or presence (of gasket, or actual valve open/closure), the car is to be returned to the shipping facility for their internal inspection and/or repair.",No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Consolidated Rail Corporation,US,

Upon offloading the totes into two (2) 330-gallon totes, no free product remained. Therefore,  it is assumed that no more than 50 gallons released. Again, all free product was contained to the trailer. One (1) 55-gallon drum of absorbent pads and  PPE was generated during the cleanup, trailer was offloaded into a new trailer provided by TCS, and remaining freight was sent on. Damaged totes and  two (2) 330-gallon totes were brought to SET's facility in Glenwood, pending disposition, and return to shipper. There were no injuries or exposures  reported.","Since the release was accidental, and appears to be related to a welded seam failure, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

The car was isolated and the shipper notified. The original incident which resulted in the damage occurred at 06:58 on May 22, 2009.  The leak from GAPX 9039 was not discovered until 13:43, May 26, 2009, when a small drip was noticed by carrier personnel after the car had been moved, along several other cars, to an adjacent rail yard .  This car had been inspected and no release detected at the time of the original incident.  There was no external sign of damage to this car.       An environmental contractor, Hepaco, Inc., responded and transferred the remaining material into another rail tank car for further handling.  All released material was cleaned-up, neutralized and properly disposed of.      The car was cleaned and purged and will be moved to a tank car shop for futher inspection to determine the exact cause of the release and the extent of damage.     Two contractor employees received a minor chemical burn to the skin on their shoulder when some of the material was splashed onto their protective suits while attempting to patch the leak.  The material entered the suit through a seam.  The two were treated with a topical cream and released from a local clinic.

The residue looked like dry caustic soda.  I walked east toward the south entrance of our facility and the white residue trail continued though it was less noticeable.  I was trying to decipher if the trail led in to our facility or led out of our facility; based on the spotting on the pavement it was determined it was clear to me that this had to be a bulk load of caustic soda that departed from our facility around 4:20 am.   I called our Bulk Driver to find out if he noticed anything peculiar with his delivery.  He mentioned that as he was attempting to unload at the customer the trailer was not building air pressure required to unload the product.  He heard an air leak coming from the top of the trailer.  Upon investigating this air leak he found air escaping from a small section on the 20” man way seal.  He attempted to tighten the closure, but they were already tight.  He shut off the air, bled the remaining air pressure, and then proceeded to loosen the fasteners that secure the dome lid in the closed position.  When the air pressure in the tanker was neutral he opened the 20” man way and found the gasket had been pinched and it had not seated properly.","Based on our best estimate there is less than two gallons of product that was released.  I cleaned and neutralized with a 0.3% solution of Phosphoric acid and Water; applying the solution on the dry residual with a small (2 gallon) pressurized bottle sprayer.  There are no injuries.  There is no property damage.    There is a small section on the gasket that came out of the channel located in the lid; when the operator finished loading the trailer and closed the lid the gasket did not seat properly.  The dome securement devices were tightened and checked, however the pinched gasket was not evident.  The gasket was replaced in the dome lid.    The material handlers that load these trailers are involved in closing these dome lids; as one of their checks prior to closing the lids they are to visually inspect the gasket and ensure it is seated in the channel prior to closing the lid.    Another corrective action is the addition of a drain ball valve.  The tanker has a spill way at the top of the trailer (a rectangular elevated parameter around the manway) and at the back corners of the spill way are drains.  Attached to these drains are hoses to help direct rinse water or residue down to the bottom of the trailer.  There are two ""drains"", one on each side of the trailer and they are joined at the bottom of the trailer and joined by a ""T"" fitting.  There is now a ball valve that has been added at the bottom of this Tee.  The ball valve is to be closed while in trailer is in transit.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA Inc.,US,

The free product released to the gravel surface beneath the above ground storage tank at the facility.  Lewis Environmental Group of Royersford, Pennsylvania was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, Lewis Environmental Group applied absorbent material, oil dry, and sand to the affected area.  A vacuum truck was utilized to recover the free liquid and water, which had pooled on the ground surface surrounding the tank.  Lewis Environmental Group proceeded to excavate the impacted gravel/soil mixture, which was containerized into one (1) rolloff box, along with the spent absorbents, oil dry, and sand.  One (1) 55-gallon drum of cleanup debris/sludge was also generated during the cleanup.  Disposal will be coordinated by Lewis Environmental Group in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at an in transit storage facility pending continuing transportation.  While at this storage facility, an inspection discovered that a small amount of material had escaped from the trailer onto the parking area where the trailer was staged.  Facility personnel immediately activated the facilities’ emergency response plan and a crew was assembled to respond to the release.  IN addition, the California Department of Toxic Substance Control was notified as a courtesy but was not reportable under their rules.      Upon arrival, the response crew, utilizing appropriate personnel protective equipment entered the trailer to identify the source of the release.  Once found it was discovered that a combination package containing a 5 gallon container of a mixed acid waste was packaged within a carbon steel UN rated container.  During the course of transportation, it is believed that the inner container cracked allowing the acidic waste material to interact with the carbon steel outer container.  It is believed that the material degraded the steel and allowed approximately ½ gallon of material to escape to the floor of the van trailer and the surface upon which the vehicle was staged.  The emergency response crew re containerized the leaking container into a suitable, compatible salvage container and proceeded to decontaminate and recover all material released.

Summit Environmental, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found no evidence of a leak. Later in the afternoon, CSXT employees complained of inhalation aggravation from possible chemical exposure, and the CSXT Hazardous Materials Manager responded to the scene. Upon investigation, it was noted that some crystallized material was present around the wash out flange on the bottom of the car which was obscured by a fabricated plate and insulation between the saddles. There was no obvious or current excursion from the car, but the bolts and flange had crystalline product indicating when the product is heated, that some release may occur during the loading and unloading process and not while in a solid state. The shipper is obtaining a FRA movement approval and the car will be released back to transportation. This incident did require a special switching move.

Train #107 south bound with an estimated speed of 45 mph derailed at MP 60.5 between latitude N29 33' 59.5"" longitude W8117' 5.7"" and N29 33' 58.1"" longitude W8117' 6.0"". The reason for the derailment is under investigation.The result of the derailment caused a hazardous material released to the environment. Rail tanker TILX 110210 laded with 17,800 gallons of hydrochloric acid at 38% concentration was punctured on the lower BL corner. The hole was approximately 6""x 6"". The release of acid to the environment was estimated at 16,800 gallons. The acid soaked into the surrounding soils by the rail car and in a naturally occurring depressed low laying area. The remaining acid was salvaged and sold to Sun Belt Chemicals.The package failure was a heavy impact from another rail car striking the lower B left end of the tank car and puncturing a 6""x6"" hole in the shell. The duration for the release was estimated at 6 to 18 hours. The first responders (Flagler County, St. Johns County (lead), and Duval established control of isolation, observation, and no evacuation. The first responders made attempts to control the leak and were deterred by heavy vegetation and the position of the acid car in the matrix of derailed cars. The second attempt was made by SWS Environmental (FEC Railway's Emergency Contractor) and the counties first responders the morning of May 10th. At this point, it was determined that a significant released occurred. The final ER and remedial actions followed with assistance from FDEP and the USEPA.

Inspection of these containers by BNSF contract responders revealed no leak source. A nearby entrained like tank container UTCU 454362 (import shipment in 20 foot IM101 tank container) was identified as the odor source. Responders found a small amount of product that had accumulated at the bottom end of this container towards the valve end at a bolted support bracket. A tank breach was suspected since it appeared that product had migrated downward from the top of a welded stiffener ring that circumferences this tank container. Later, a stress corrosion crack at a weld seem at the top portion of the welded stiffener ring was identified at the leak source. All spillage that did not evaporate was wiped. UTCU 454362 was carefully moved and isolated at the intermodal facility's containment area. The product in UTCU 454362 was successfully transferred without further incident to another tank container on 5/08/09.

The area was segregated, and 2 supervisors cleaned up area with absorbant pads and stored the clean up material and damaged drum into a recovery drum. The consignee Minitube accepted the recovery drum with the rest of the shipment. The local FAA was advised.The accident was a result of a forklift error, not from any defect with the drum.    Corrective action on the part of the handling agent , Menzies Aviation, was to double skid hazmat shipments and use a pallet-jack, instead of a forklift, whenver possible. In addition the forklift driver was instructed to use greater care with the forklift , especially in regards to hazmat.","The handling agent, Menzies Aviation, made the following corrective actions :   1.

The gate guard noticed a very small wet spot under the trailer. Upon inspection by the Shift Supervisor and 2 different Qulaity drivers, it was determined that the trailer was potentially leaking from the vessel under the insulation.  The trailer had been at the truck turnaround and a small spot was found there as well.  The 2 wet spots at the turnaround and the gate were covered with absorbent and cleaned up.  The trailer was returned to the loading rack and a second trailer was brought in from Quality and the material was transloaded into the new trailer.    The trailer is only 3 years old and they did find a crack in  the barrel once they got it apart at the repair shop.

He backed his trailer into 96 door and I (Brian Prince) opened the trailer and discovered a small crate had fallen on top of a pallet of 10 pails.  One pail had been hit by the crate causing the lid to bend and break its seal.  The pails had the flammable placard on them so I then called our regional safety manager (Steve Fitzpatrick).  I then grabbed gloves and the face shield and proceeded to clean up the spill.  After picking up the damaged pail I realized about 2 of the 5 gallons had been released.","James Gator, the driver who loaded the create that fell on the pails will be retrained on our I.C.E.

After talking with Terry Cockrell, she was able to get me an MSDS on the product.

M&M Environmental Protection responded to the incident and determined that the o-ring on the vacuum breaker had rolled out of its seat and pinched in the vacuum breaker allowing product to bypass the vacuum breaker as it sloshed inside the tank. The most likely explanation for the o-ring to come out of the seat was due to an improper inspection and/or test of the vacuum breaker at the shipper facility by using excessive force (using foot or the like) to test the breaker. Had the breaker been tested by slowly and smoothly pressing on the breaker the o-ring most likely would not have been affected.  M&M replaced the o-ring and cleaned the product off of the tank car body. There was no product released to the ground.,Improved training and/or inspection procedures at the shipper facility would have prevent this incident and therefore are recommended at this time.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1478,Port Terminal Railroad Association,US,

Train #107 south bound with an estimated speed of 45mph derailed at MP 60.5 between latitude N29 33’ 59.5” longitude W81 17’ 5.7” and N29 33’ 58.1” longitude W81 17’ &0”. The reason for the derailment is under investigation.   The result of the derailment caused a hazardous material released to the environment. Rail tanker Tl1.X 110210 laded with 17,800 gallons of hydrochloric acid at 38% concentration was punctured on the lower 81 corner. The hole was approximately 6”x 6”. The release of acid to the environment was estimated at 16,800 gallons. The acid soaked into the surrounding soils by the rail car and in a naturally occurring depressed low laying area. The remaining acid was salvaged and sold to Sun Belt Chemicals.   The package failure was a heavy impact from another rail car striking the lower B left end of the tank car and puncturing a 6”x6” hole in the shell. The duration for the release was estimated at 6 to 18 hours. The first responders (Flagler County, St. Johns County (lead), and Duval) established control of isolation, observation, and no evacuation. The first responders made attempts to control the leak and were deterred by heavy vegetation and the position of the acid car in the matrix of derailed cars. The second attempt was made by SWS Environmental (FEC Railway’s Emergency Contractor) and the counties first responders the morning of May l0’.

This report of a leak was from 3302 South Eastman Road, in Longview TX.  When the HazMat team arrived there they found a small vapor leak at the back of an Airgas ammonia trailer.  The leak appeared to be coming from a 1” globe valve at the back of the trailer.  After donning the proper gear, a crew went into the hot zone where they found a small leak coming from a vapor valve at the rear of the trailer.  The valve was tightened and the leak stopped.   The total time of the incident from the time of the 1st report to the time the vapor leak was controlled was approximately 2 hours.  Because of the nature of the chemical involved and the close proximity of a restaurant, the patrons and workers were evacuated from this restaurant, for precautionary measures. The duration of the evacuation was a total of about 1 hour.  According to the HazMat team that responded approximately 5 pounds of ammonia was released to the atmosphere and no clean up was necessary.  No injuries or illness were reported.","We have review all applicable training with the Airgas driver involved with this incident.

The OEPA was notified at 17:40 hrs., and a follow-up call was made at 18:00 hrs.  Invista used an in-house response contractor that was dispatched to the scene and found the vacuum relief valve dust cover was missing and there was crystalized product on the inside of the protective housing . Contractor personnel could not replace the vacuum relief device dust cover but did decontaminate the car and performed a pressure test to ensure there were no leaks. An FRA movement approval was obtained by the customer and the car was released for transport. This incident did require a special switching move.

I then opened the valve; went and checked the fill box and went to the trailer to switch from Supreme Product to Mid-Grade product. As I was doing this, I heard a strong fluid flowing sound. I turned around and saw product flowing out of the discharge valve on the truck. I ran back and closed the valve, immediately broke out the spill kit and used it on the spilled product. I contacted the terminal for assistance, telephoned the Fire Department and shut down the station. Upon inspection of the fitting and hose it appeared that the banding material was loose and not fitting properly which resulted in hose being pushed off the fitting due to the pressure of the product flow, resulting in the spill. The Fire Department responded within 5 minutes, and inspected the scene. Fire Department personnel stated they had no concerns and departed the scene. The Fire Department contacted public works. Public works personnel waited for a supervisor to arrive at the scene. Terminal Manager arrived at scene discussed with public works personnel, solutions and actions to be taken. Public works personnel will return to scene later this afternoon to ensure proper clean up was completed. Terminal Manger contacted environmental clean up personnel, en route when terminal manger left the scene. Approximately 30 gallons of RUL was released to the ground. A minimal amount made its way into the storm water drain adjacent to the delivery area but was contained in the basin. Some product migrated into the mud around the basin and will be removed by the environmental company upon their arrival.",Ensure that all hose couplings are secure prior to making any delivery.

The load shift caused a small hole to be torn in the bottom edge of one 15-gallon drum by a protruding object.  The driver heard the load shift and immediately began looking for a safe place to pull over.  The driver exited the freeway and pulled into a large parking area.  Upon exiting the vehicle, the driver saw Muriatic Acid leaking through the bed (front side) of the cargo area of the vehicle to the ground.  The driver contacted emergency personnel (city fire/hazmat) who arrived on scene within approximately 10 minutes.  The city hazmat team applied Soda Ash to the spilled Muriatic Acid which both neutralized and contained the material.

Vehicle #2 operated by Pan Handle Eastern Pipeline Company backed into traffic from a driveway in front of the Heritage Transport vehicle.  Vehicle #1 slowed down to allow Vehicle #2 into traffic.  Vehicle #2 continued northbound on US 231 in front of Vehicle #1.  A short distance later Vehicle #2 turned on the turn signal to indicate a right hand turn.  The driver of Vehicle #1 began to slow down to approximately 45 mph when he saw the driver's intention of turning right.  As the driver of Vehicle #2 began the righthand turn the driver changed position and then made a U-turn in front of Vehicle #1.  In an effort to avoid Vehicle #2, the driver of Vehicle #1 moved to the left lane but was unable to avoid hitting Vehicle #2.  Vehicle #1 hit the left frontdoor jam of Vehicle #2 and both vehicles ended up in the ditch on the west side of US 231.  Vehicle #1 was carrying an intermodal container that contained 19,940 k of UN3432, Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Solid, Mixture, 9, PGII (PCB Remediation Waste, Sediment/Soil). After the vehicle came to a rest in the ditch, it was sitting at a 45 degree angle. See Attachment F.  Approximately 10 pounds of material were released from the intermodal container.

After the impact the tanker went out of control and overturned several times.  The transport truck and trailer came to rest on its side facing northeast across the roadway.  The cause of the dicharge was due to the trailer striking the roadway.  This caused a tear or rip in the rear portion (right side) of the trailer.  The discharge occurred after the accident.  The discharge was reported by an unknow person or passerby to the wreck scene.  Emergency crews were on the scene at approximately 5:50 pm to start to migated the spill.  The estimated time of the leak was approximatley 15 to 20 minutes.  Due to the size of the tear the product was able to flow with out restriction.  The size of the tear was approximately 8 to 12 inches.,"This unfortunate incident was due to no fault of Reliable Tank Line, LLC.

The driver was unable to turn the truck back onto the roadway.  The truck broke through the guardrail and traveled down the embankment coming to rest on its driver's side.  The front compartment (1) was gashed near the midpoint and approximately 1/2 of the gasoline in that compartment leaked out.  On the rear compartment (4) of the trailer the top dome lid sprung partway open releasing approximately 1/2 of the gasoline in that compartment.  Compartments 2 and 3 held and contained all of the gasoline they contained.
