Product started to ""fountain"" out of the fill pipe of tank #1 as product continued to flow into tank #2. Initial investigation reveals that driver neglected to replace and secure the fill cap on tank #1 after completion of delivery which allowed the pressure from filling tank #2 to back up into tank #1 casuing the product to vent out of the uncapped fill hole.

He also noticed that the rail car sump pad was overflowing onto the ground.  He immediately worked the belly valve to stop the leak.  The loader noticed a piece of red debris that was dislodged from the rail car’s belly valve.  There was approximately 100 gallons of styrene that spilled out of the rail pan and overflowed the sump and traveled approximately 150 feet in a narrow path.  The rail car sump pump had tripped electrically and did not pump when the high level indicator was activated.  Area monitoring was conducted and it was determined that full face respirator protection was required for clean-up activities.    The styrene was channeled to a trench, flushed with water to the sump and then into the slop oil tank for reprocessing.  Approximately 92-gallons of styrene were recovered.  The total amount spilled was approximately 756 pounds, which did not exceed the Reportable Quantity for styrene (CAS # 100-42-52) of 1,000 pounds.  All soil that came in contact with the styrene was excavated and will be ultimately disposed of off-site.",The cause of the leak was debris lodged in the belly valve of the rail car that prevented the valve from closing completely.  This combined with the sump pump malfunction caused the overflow.  The corrective actions that have been taken are for the Operator to make sure the belly valve is closed completely before loading starts and the Operator must check the sump pump by switching to manual mode to check for proper operation.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2050,"Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP",US,

PIPER PO BOX 445,MACOMB,IL,61455,Carrier,"On Monday 11/05/07 at 12:15 PM West Central FS, Inc experienced an anhydrous ammonia release. The location of the release was on county road N850 Adair, IL 61411, approximately 50 yards west of intersecting county road E2250. A pickup truck driven by West Central FS employee was pulling anhydrous ammonia tank A33 1 and was proceeding south on E2250 and turned right (West bound) onto N850. After making the turn the front left lug bolt that attaches the tank to the running gear sheared off and the left front lug bolt pulled loose from the running gear. This then allowed the front of the nurse tank to come down and make contact with the asphalt road on the driver’s side of the running gear. Before employee was able to stop the truck which was pulling the tank now partially on the ground the back two lug bolts broke loose from the running gear, separating it completely from the running gear. The nurse tank then rolled over on the asphalt crushing the safety cage which in turn broke off the liquid withdraw valve allowing ammonia to escape from the tank into the atmosphere. The tank came to a stop in the south ditch on county road N850 in the upright position.    The escaping ammonia was dissipating into the atmosphere at a rapid rate. The wind was blowing approximately 20-25 MPH to the Southeast. One person in a house directly east of county road E2250 on county road N850 as a precautionary measure was asked to evacuate. No other homes or buildings were down wind of the tank’s location. The accident occurred in a very rural area that is 100% cropland.    The Illinois State Police was immediately notified along with the Adair Fire Department. Both entities responded to the scene. The National Response Center was notified of the release at 12:23 PM. We were provided with report #853653 by Pundt. The Illinois Emergency Management Agency was then notified at 12:33 PM and we were provided Incident #H-2007-1486. The McDonough County ESDA office was then notified of the release at 12:44 PM. Dan Kreps was the ESDA coordinator that was notified, no incident 4 or report # was provided by employee.    At the scene the determination was made by the Adair Fire Department, Illinois State Police officer Todd Teal and West Central FS to allow the tank to continue to vent off the ammonia into the atmosphere. The escaping ammonia was blowing across cropland and not negatively impacting any humans or animals or the environment so the decision was made not to apply a water fog to the escaping ammonia to “Knock the ammonia plume down”. Also Officer Teal checked IL Rte 136 and the ammonia plume was not coming near the highway. The local road district commissioner was also notified of the release and he blocked off county roads N850 and E2250 to eliminate traffic from entering the incident area.    At Approximately 3:00 PM the ammonia ceased escaping from the tank as the pressure in the tank had equalized with the atmospheric pressure. This was evident by the predominate fr","IN SEASON SPOT CHECK OF AMMONIA NURSE THANKS WILL BE CONDUCTED TO INSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE LUG BOLTS THAT ATTACH THE NURSE TANK TO THE RUNNING GEAR ARE IN SOUND CONDITION.

The package contained broken mercury thermometers with liquid mercury and mercury contaminated debris.  When being prepared for transportation from the customer's site, the materials were placed in a plastic bag or liner and then placed in a 1G fiber box.   While in transit, the plastic bag ruptured causing a small amount of liquid to leak through the container wall.  All liquid mercury and any mercury contaminated surfaces were collected and containerized for transport to the original off-site disposal facility.",Materials containing liquid mercury should not be packaged into 1G containers with plastic bags.  A plastic 1H2 container should be used to prevent to potential for a release.

Flight arrived into gate B-27 and shipment was scheduled to depart from A-2.     Shipment consisted of Sodium Iodide I-123, inner packages consisted of 30 lead containers (3-4” in length) in one Type A Package, Yellow II shipment, 13.2 hour half life with up to 6 days of particle release.  Each inner container contained one capsule; each capsule contained Iodide salt (solid).     During ramp transport from B-27 to B-North Bag Point, package apparently fell off bag cart and was subsequently lodged underneath a cart; unknown to the driver.  Another ramp employee alerted the tug driver to the package.  Inspection revealed, the entire contents of package were released in the ramp area on B-North (30 lead containers with pop caps; each container contained 1 capsule of material).      Immediate notification was made to the Operations Control Center (OCC) who in turn contacted the corporate Emergency Response Duty Officer  (EMDO).  Based on evaluation of the scenario and the unknown location and condition of the 30 vials, the EMDO advised the operation to contact local emergency response (fire department).  The EMDO in turn contacted the shipper at the emergency response number located on the paperwork to obtain detailed information on the contents.  After this information was confirmed, the NRC was notified.  EMDO was contacted by Sidney ""Barty"" Simonton of the GA EPD Radiological Response Team inquiring on the situation and offering assistance.  Sidney ""Barty"" Simonton took point on search and retrieval.      It was determined the majority of the spill was confined to B-North NLVR between ramp 2, 3 and gate B-36.  Twenty-nine (29) containers were recovered in various states of condition from intact to crushed.  According to GA EPD, 65% inner containers were compromised (opened) with 50% of those being crushed.  Under the direction of GA EPD, Airport FD hosed NLVR and grass area to further deplete half life (product is a salt and dilution reduced the contamination risk).      HEPACO, Delta's environmental contract service, monitored the area as needed for up to 6 days 24 hours a day. Cart and bag tug were tested and no detectable radiation was found.",The requirement to secure packages of dangerous goods during all modes of transport were reviewed with Atlanta Ramp Leadership to be included in daily briefings with all personnel.

While traveling on Interstate 68 eastbound in Morgantown, West Virginia, the Slay Transportation Co. Inc. driver was involved in a fatal vehicle accident, which caused the truck to rollover off the embankment of the roadway.  The tank was damaged, which resulted in the release of approximately 180 gallons of free product to the soil along the road shoulder.  Free product was being released at approximately one gallon per minute, prior to offload and containment.  Monongalia County Emergency Management responded to assess the site.  Bayer Material Science was contacted to discuss response actions.  Weavertown Environmental Group of Carnegie, Pennsylvania was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Bayer Material Science responded to offload the damaged tanker.  Upon completion of offload, Weavertown Environnmental Group proceeded to excavate the contaminated soil from the impacted area.

Borthwick,PORTLAND,OR,97227,Shipper,"When Tarr Employees opened the trailer door of the Portland delivery truck/trailer combo they noticed a release had occurred.  The driver noticed the source of the leak was a tote. Immediately both drivers on site took action to stop the leaking material from going into the storm drain. A sealing magnetic mat was placed over the drain opening.  They had to remove one tote to gain access to the tote that was leaking. They noted that the 2 inch ball valve was almost a quarter of the way open and the 2 inch camlock fitting had come off. The valve was closed immediately. The Operations Manager, Harold Eveland, was notified as soon as the initial emergency procedures had been completed. When he arrived, he noticed that material was leaking into the catch basin despite the drain cover. He called Thermo Fluids on an emergency basis to come and vacuum the pool of solvent and water.  Corporate was notified and they contacted the WA State Emergency Mgt. who notified the Department of Ecology (DOE).  Harold also called the Regional Valley Fire Authority. They came and inspected the scene, were satisfied that correct emergency response procedures were being followed and left.  Thermo Fluids arrived and pumped out the catch basin and water being utilized to flush any solvent laying on the asphalt.  All of the leaking material (Solvent 140F) was captured by this process. Harold along with the Thermo Fluids rep checked additional catch basins in the immediate area and found no contamination from the spill. There was no evidence of product in any other catch basins/storm drains. The DOE arrived to inspect the area where the leak occurred.  They concurred that the area had been cleaned up as well as possible and there was no further contamination. They also inspected the tote that had been leaking and found that container integrity had been restored once the valve had been closed completely. Tarr then initiated a Corrective Action Report (CAR) and started the process on their fleet of totes to change all 2 inch ball valves to locking ball valves and all camlocks to locking camlock fittings.","The maintenance Manager has been directed to change out ball valves and camlocks on all totes to reflect locking capabilities.

The damaged drum leaked product from a small hole near the bottom chime of the container. The driver placed  drum on it's side to stop the leak. He then received help to place it into an over pack.,"During the incident investigation it was determined the skid that was to be placed in the front of the trailer was only 36"" in length.

Upon opening trailer at customer location, a leak was discovered.  Apparently, one (1) 350-gallon tote bin had a loose fitting safety valve, which caused the release.  Approximately 300 gallons of free product were released inside the trailer, and leaked onto the asphalt surface.  The Local Fire Department responded to contain the free product.  Hulcher Services, Inc. of Atlanta, Georgia was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Upon arrival on site, printing ink was detected within the trailer and on the asphalt surface beneath the trailer.  Hulcher Services, Inc. proceeded to apply sand to contain the free product, and used a street sweeper to recover the spent sand, and remove residual product.  The spent sand was containerized into one (1) roll-off box, to be held for disposal in accordance with local, state, and federal regulations.  There were no injuries or exposures reported.","Since release was accidental, and appears to be related to a loose safety valve, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

The tractor tanker did not suffer any actual release of the material as a result of the accident.  The tractor tanker became overturned on its site and blocked all 3 lanes of eastbound traffic for ~11 hours.  Local officials also closed down the westbound lane for around 5 hours.  Due to the traffic through the area, a local school canceled classes for the remainder of the day.  Upon notification to ERTS, we dispatched UST Environmental to the site.  Once on site it was determined by the Incident Command Officer (ICO-fire department chief) that a transfer of the material would be required prior to moving the damaged tanker.  UST personnel suited up into the appropriate PPE and began the transfer into a new tanker provided by Quality Carriers.  Due to the cold weather, the material became viscous.  Because of this, the ICO ordered that the tank be cut open so that the material could be more easily transfered.  Once the tank had been cut open, the materials were transferred into the undamaged tanker.  No release occurred as a result of this motor vehicle accident.

MaxYield employee Ryan Stokes was custom applying NH3 (Anhydrous Ammonia) on the farm owned by Jim Silliman about 3 miles North of Emmetsburg. The address of where Ryan made his calls and which was the closest to the release would be 3272 470th Aye, Emmetsburg, Iowa. This “safe zone” was at the end of Jim Silliman’ s lane located about a ‘/2 south of the release. The CAT tractor Ryan was operating is equipped with auto- steer and while Ryan was observing the application process he suddenly seen there was a cloud of NH3 vapor near the rear of the applicator. Ryan quickly turned the flow off but product continued to stream out. Thinking correctly, Ryan then turned the tractor upwind to try to get in a safe position. Since there was very little (if any) wind that evening, the exodus of product was hanging in the air and becoming overwhelming. It was going to be a challenge to escape the vapor cloud which had now encircled the cab. Ryan instinctively took evasive maneuvers with the tractor to try to pull past and away from the cloud and position the tractor correctly. He did this by shifting to higher gears to gain more speed and by making right angles to escape the heavy flow. My investigation the following morning showed that Ryan traveled about 800’ in various directions to attempt to outrun the cloud. Since the valve was pointed forward, Ryan was hoping he would get the flow to shoot another direction while he made his exit from the cab and the area. His tactic worked relatively well and he was able to then quickly stop the tractor, put it in neutral, turn off the ignition switch, and exit the cab. Ryan then ran to a nearby gravel road where he then called 911. His next call was to his supervisor Gerald Zwiefel who immediately notified me on my cell to help in finding solutions and to make the necessary notifications. I then called Ryan back to get further details so I could relay the information. Ryan said the Fire Department and Law Enforcement were now on the scene.   After getting the details as far as we knew them at the time, I then called the National Response Center at 800-424-8802 at 10:22 pm and talked with a Mr. Snowden to inform him of the release as required by law when any NH3 release is greater than 100 lb. (about 20 gal). NRC Report number:   854379. My next call was to PERS 800-633-8253 at 10:30 pm where I talked with Kevin to inform them of what we were doing up to this point. Kevin said it sounded like we had things under control and said I should call again if we run into any complications. At 10:35 I called the Iowa DNR 515- 28 1-8694 to inform them of what we had and steps that were being taken at this time. They will page the necessary people that need to be notified in their agenc","A solution to reducing repeat incidents is actually 2-part.   One, the coupler needs to be tight without chances of wire or chain getting into the threads to impede the connection. We will implement a better way to connect these plastic caps company wide. In our shop the following morning we tested this theory by hooking up a connection exactly like the one in the field. It was interesting to note that when a connection is properly made, it takes 2 ‘/4 turns to separate completely. When the coupler was tightened when jammed against a plastic cap retaining   Wire, it was separated in a 1/2 turn. This test was done only to show that the wire and/or chain could cause a problem if it was not seen, and happened to be resting in one of the thread grooves. Two, the excess flow valves need to be connected in a way which will allow them to do their job. I called Davis Equipment and they were well aware of the problem we face. Currently 2 products are being introduced into the market to help with this. Continental is designing one to be tethered to the tractor by a cable so in the event of a detachment, the line would pull the auto-shutoff in the closed position. Davis Equipment felt farmers would not be in favor of this because they do not want to be attached directly to the tank. The second device is designed by Squibb and is an electronic device which requires power to be in the “open” position. Once the power in interrupted in any way, the valve slams shut. Davis Equipment looked to be more in favor of this safety valve but also added it may be quite expensive and felt unless it was mandated by law, that it would not be accepted by the general public.   Footnote: Working with a pressurized product such as NH3 requires special attention to detail. Connections must be proper, PPE in place, etc. Any flaw in the network of equipment can result in an unfavorable outcome. We were fortunate this incident happened in the middle of the field and no injuries occurred or environmental concerns were affected   Product Lost: Estimate 410 2allon. Ryan Stokes, the operator at the time knew exactly how many acres were covered and how many gallon were left in the tanks.   No creeks, ponds, or rivers nearby. Clear skies, 40 degrees, calm winds. Chiseled soybean stubble.   This information is correct based on my observation and discussions with Ryan Stokes, Don   Haverman, and Davis Equipment.

At the conclusion of the collection event, the materials are prepared for transportation to a licensed waste management facility for disposal.  During the transportation phase of the operation, a 55 gallon container of flammable liquids developed a hole in the bottom of the drum allowing approximately 30 gallons of material to escape from the container onto the floor of the van trailer.  Approximately 20 gallons escaped from the trailer onto the asphalt roadway.  Upon discovering the release, the driver took immediate actions to prevent the continued release of the material by turning the drum over and spreading a suitable absorbent material onto the released material.  The local fire and police departments were called as was the Texas Department of Environmental Quality (RPT. # 20073969).  Clean Harbors dispatched a crew to the scene to respond to the leaking container.  While en route, the Conroe Police Department contracted a 3rd party emergency response company to initiate the clean-up process in order to open the lane of traffic that was blocked.  Please note that the roadway itself was not shut down but rather a lane of traffic.  Crews from Clean Harbors and Milstead Environmental absorbed all free liquids, containerized all spill debris and product that was released to both the roadway and the trailer floor.  All spill clean-up debris was placed into appropriate containers and sent for disposal to a licensed waste management facility.  The damaged container was also placed into a suitable salvage drum and continued to the intended waste management facility.","In order to rpevent a recurrence of this incident, the employees involved in the preparation and shipment of household hazardous wastes for shipment have been re-instructed to inspect each container before it is used to insure that there is no visible sign of damage or questinable integrity.

The shipper was notified to inspect this tank car and ensure proper securement. In the morning of 11/20/07, a shipper contract responder inspected CONX 1215. The liquid valve's closure cap was not applied. The camlock closure cap when applied prevented the protective housing cover from being fully closed. The contract responder applied a shorter pipe nipple and secured the closure cap for the liquid valve around 0930 hrs. MST on 11/20/07. During the responder's securement process, an estimated 50 gallons of product was spilled via the liquid valve fittings and the responder reported this spillage to local BNSF management.

An initial inspection of TILX 400750 revealed that the 486 psi frangible disc had partially ruptured, rather than fully ruptured. The shipper replaced the frangible disc and sent the failed disc to the manufacturer for analysis. After the venting stopped, TILX 400750 was placed at the consignee's location for future unloading. It may take 3 to 5 weeks for the remaining product to warm and elevate the internal tank car pressure to 200 psi, a level for safe unloading.

He was traveling east on FM407 then turned north on FM2264 when turning on FM2264 a tote shifted with a hose hooked up. The valve was put in a bind from the hose causing the valve to break in the threads letting the Foamatron EFP-1406 leak out. Our driver continued to drive north on FM2264 not knowing the chemical was leaking. The driver then turned into the Joe Thurman #3 lease for Devon made a circle and saw the leak trail. He then got out to check, finding the broken valve. The driver called his supervisor David Siegfried. David called Garner Environmental Services to clean up the spill. Devon called Chico Auto Parts and Service and Chico mitigated the spill on the Devon location.Chico Auto Parts and Serice mitigated the spill under the supervision of Devon. Eight (8) yards of soil was removed and taken to the landfill. Garner Environmental called TAZ Environmental and TAZ cleaned up the spill on FM2264.","After performing a root cause analysis we developed a corrective action plan consisting of the following steps:  1.Meeting with all drivers covering DOT Hazmat transportation regulation and DOT exemption 12412 highlighting the points that no hose can be hooked up to totes while in transit, and all containers must be secured to insure no movement of container is possible.  2.Driver training on DOT Hazmat transportation regulations and DOT exemption 12412.  3.Development of pre-trip check list to prevent future or similar occurrences.  4.Discuss this incident in Safety Meetings and Toolbox Safety Meetings.  5.Developed and posted Safety Alerts of the incident in all District Offices.",Yes,IBC,"Plastic, freestanding, for liquids",31H2,Yes,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,6615,"Champion Technologies, Inc.",US,

The driver was instructed to contain the material and cover with peat moss.At Approx. 1800 hours the incident was upgraded to 10 gallons of released product by a call from the local fire department to the terminal. The fire department indicated the material was contained and the vehicle could possibly been driven back to the terminal.The supervisor departed the terminal with another driver to pick up the unit. Upon arrival to the scene the incident had escalated to the local hazmat team being dispatched.The company immediately upon receipt of this information dispatched an emergency response team to clean up the release.The pails had turned over due to inadequate blocking and bracing.2 of the 5gallon pails had released onto the trailer floor due to the fall. The lids were crushed and broke open.The total release was managed in 8.5 hours. The driver was transported to a local hospital and later returned to the scene.The gymnastics event in the adjacent building was evacuated as a precautionary measure. The duration of the evacuation was 90 miutes, which would have been the conclusion of the event.Another person from the gymnastics event had left the event and returned via her parents complaining of symptoms related to the incident.

The technician replaced a rupture disc .gasket on the air release cap. The technician informed Pan AN officials that the gasket itself was missing causing a gap which allowed the product inside to escape via this space. With the installation of a new gasket, the tank car was tested by moving it back and forth.

The roll-over caused the Diesel Fuel tank to rupture spilling 300 gallons of diesel fuel.","Driver re-training.  The Driver's description of the accident was that he allowed his right front tire to run off the shoulder of the road where there was a significant drop off from the pavement.  In his attempts to steer the truck back onto the road, he lost control of the steering which resulted in the truck weight shifting and causing the subsequent roll-over.

The loader immediately stopped loading and closed the valve.,The loaders have been trained to also look at the internal valve stem to confirm internal valve is closed.

The freight wastendered to Amerijet in Jacksonville, FL (JAX) for delivery in Trinidad, W.I. (POS) Shipment was off loaded inTrinidad, W.I. and moved to customs for clearance. On 11/22/2007, we received an e-mail from our agent inTrinidad, W.I, stating a customs officer states ""I certify having examined one (1) box and found contents to be one (1)roll label unit, correct as invoiced and as entered. However various machine parts were found for which properinvoices should be submitted stating unit price for same. In addition two (2) rolls of printed labels and two (2) gallonsof Phosphoric Acid were found. Values for same are to be submitted.""When Allstates WorldCargo, Inc. received this e-mail, we immediately contacted the shipper, Swisher International,for an explanation. Swisher International's shipping department advised that they did not know anything about 2gallons of Phosphoric acid. They checked with the mechanic that packaged the shipment and he advised thatanother vendor requested him to consolidate the 2 gallons with his shipment to ship to the consignee. The mechanicadvised that he did not know the 2 gallons were hazardous. Swisher International immediately contacted the vendorwho sent the 2 gallons to them to request the proper hazardous material shipping description which is included in thisreport. There was not a spill of the hazardous material; however, it did move through the transportation systemwithout being disclosed as a hazardous shipment. (As such, for purposes of this Incident Report form, we haveconsidered the incident to have occurred in Jacksonville, FL, when the shipment was tendered to the airline, ratherthan in Trinidad, W.I., when the contents were discovered.)","Allstates WorldCargo, Inc. has contacted the shipper, Swisher International and have reviewed the requirements ofbeing a known shipper and transportation regulations of shipping hazardous materials.

They must also provide theproper shipping documentation with the shipment for all hazardous materials.For the next six months, Allstates WorldCargo, Inc. will physically open and inspect all shipments from SwisherInternational before tendering to an airline in order to prevent future occurrences described above.

The cause of this derailment was attributed to a broken rail at a field weld on the track just inside the tunnel at the west portal. An intermodal flatcar with intermodal container TRLU 635881 derailed with TRLU 635881 on its side. TRLU 635881 came to rest hanging over a steep embankment. After TRLU 635881 was moved to a safe and level location, a BNSF contractor inspected the lading inside. All eighty 55 gallon steel closed head drums inside TRLU 635881 incurred denting from derailment dynamics. One drum sustained a four inch cut at the mid-upper portion of the drum sidewall and released some product. All these drums were placed into secure overpack drums and loaded into another container for transport continuation. The spillage inside the damaged TRLU 635881 was cleaned and the small amount of product that leaked outside the intermodal container onto the ground was remediated.",No additional comments.,No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,80,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5040,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Ms. Tunge advised no injuries, no illnesses, and no waterways were involved with this incident. Kim Keeling, Manager Environmental Field Operations, was notified and responded. At 09:44 AM, Keeling advised that the pin of the handle was unsecured which resulted in the release. State and federal regulatory agencies were notified. At 1 0:32 AM, Keeling reported the securement pin for the valve handle was not sealable and bad ordered. Mr. Keeling advised the valve was wedged open previously by contact with the ground, which caused the release. Mr. Keeling stated the handle was placed back in the closed position with the pin secured temporarily until the tankcar reached its final destination where it would be off-loaded and repaired.

Environmental Management contacted Eco-Logical Environmental Services, Inc. (ELliS) an Environmental Management approved environmental subcontractor and requested that ELES respond. The ELES response team arrived on site. It was observed that the material had impacted the trailer floor and the outer edge of the trailer. The release did not impact the ground. It was observed that a pallet with six (6) 5-gallon plastic containers of resin solution were located at the rear of the the trailer. A large wooden spool that was located in front of the pallets had rolled back onto the pallet and crushed one of the 5-gallon containers. ft was observed that the spooi had been braced but the weight of the spooi broke through the bracing (inefficient blocking and bracing) A small puncture hole on the bottom of the 5-gallon container was observed. Approximately 1 gallon of resin product had been released. The release had impacted the pallet and a 3-foot by 1-foot area of the trailer floor. The containers were removed from the pallet and the pallet was cleaned. The damaged container was overpacked in a drum. The drum was labeled and placed back on the trailer. Absorbent material was then applied to the imapcted area on the trailer floor. The trailer floor and the rear (exterior) of the trailer were cleaned. The absorbent material and debris ware then placed into a 5-gallon container. The unit was then released. The 5-gallon container of contaminated absorbents and debris was transported back to the ELES facility pending disposal arrangements. On December 7,2007 the one 5-gallon container of contaminated absorbents was transported to Southwest Landfill TX, LP (Allied Waste) in Canyon, Texas for disposal.","Have communicated with Con-Way Freight in New Columbia, PA (who loaded trailer) regarding the failure to properly block the cargo.Con-Way was to take internal measures to ensure proper blocking in the future.",No,INSIDE CONTAIN,"Plastic container, no capacity or description given",CONT PLS,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,LAND SPAN HAZ,US,

While driving, on Route 350 south of Warriors Mark, PA he lost control of the tractor trailer. The trailer made contact with the guard rail, and it caused the trailer to flip onto its side. It came to rest on the birm of the road with punctures in at least the front compartment. An emergency worker who happened to be coming the other way, helped the driver get out of the wreckage. The package failure was caused by the ragged edges of the guard rail, and it is believed that the trailer had damage the entire length of the structure. The gasoline then caught fire, there was an explosion, and the heat of the fire destroyed the entire tractor & trailer. The fire lasted for approximately one hour, and the amount of gasoline that escaped the fire and went into the ground can not be determined. Warriors Mark Fire Company, PA State Police, And Huntingdon County Emergency Response team all responded to the 911 call. The driver was stabilized and transported to Altoona Hospital. The fire was controlled, and contained to an area of approximately 70 yards by 50 yards.","Through company directives and a safety meeting held on December 10, 2007 Sel-Lo Oil, Inc. has emphasized the dangers of speed, and the consequences of our liquid cargo slosh and how drastically it changes the center of gravity on our vehicles.",Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC306,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,288100,"SEL-LO OIL, INC",US,

ANDERSON,"MANAGER,TRANSPORTATION SAFETY",26220 Enterprise Court,LAKE FOREST,CA,92630,Carrier,"At approximately 1125 hours, 23 November 2007, Andrew Shea, Apria Healthcare employee, was driving west on Route N, approximately .2 miles before County Road 140th SE in Buchanan, MO. Shea was driving an Apria Healthcare 2003 Isuzu FRR box truck, MO license #587761, Oxygen placarded and marker 1073,  when he dropped the curb side wheels onto the right shoulder of the road, over corrected, skidded across the centerline, continued skidding, and ran off the left side of the road, where it struck a ditch and overturned.    In response to Shea’s report the Missouri State Highway Patrol (3 units), the Easton Fire Department and the San Antonio Fire Department responded to the scene. They proceeded to close Route N between 140th and 144th, approximately ½ mile. Upon observing a white vapor coming from the truck the troopers had contacted the Region H, Homeland Security Response Team, Saint Joseph, MO for response.    At approximately 1300 hours Shea was transported to OHS-Compcare for treatment or pain in his right side by an Apria Healthcare employee.    At approximately 1330 hours the Region H, Homeland Security Response Team arrived on the scene with two vehicles and four individuals. They drove out though a field to approach the vehicle. Stanley Crockett, Apria Healthcare Branch Logistics Manager attempted to talk with them but they refused.     They proceeded to suit up two individuals in Level A fully encapsulated suits. At approximately 1430 hours they broke open the roof of the box on the tuck and began off loading cylinders (Oxygen, compressed) and other equipment from the truck. After they finished they advised the fire personnel that until the truck mounted vessel (Oxygen, refrigerated liquid) finished venting no one could approach the vehicle.     There did not appear to be any damage to the cryogenic vessel and the “venting” was a result of the vessel being on it’s side which did not allow the road relief valve to function properly. Stanley Crockett advised them that if they were going to wait for it to vent that way it would take several hours. They would need to open the vent valve to blow off pressure. They then requested Crockett respond to the truck and tell them where the vent valve was. Upon reaching the truck they had him enter the truck and open the vent valve. At that time he examined the vessel and determined that it had not been damaged or compromised in any way. He then opened the vent valve to relieve the pressure. Within approximately five minutes the vessel stopped venting. He was then advised that they could load up the equipment that had been off loaded.    By approximately 1500 hours tow trucks had righted the vehicle and towed it from the scene and the road was reopened.    It should be noted that there was no release of hazardous materials, other then what the hazmat team had vented off.     The justification for a four man hazmat response team to a possible oxygen spill is questionable, much less, 2.5 hours at the scen",Driver safety programs will be reviewed with the drivers at this location.,No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,2688,"Apria Healthcare, Inc",US,
