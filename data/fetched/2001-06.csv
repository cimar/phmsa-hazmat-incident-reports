UPON ARRIVAL AT NARITA, THE CARGO LOADED IN AKE37658JL WAS FOUND CRUSHED AND RETAPED. 4.  JAL/JFK WAS NOTIFIED BY NARITA ON JUNE 4, 2001@ 0232L OF THIS ACCIDENT. 5.  OUR INITIAL INVESTIGATION SHOWED THIS CARGO WAS FORWARED WITHOUT IRREGULARITY FROM TIME OF      ACCEPTANCE TO LOADING ON THE AIRCRAFT. 6.  THROUGHOUT THE DAY OF JUNE 4 WE CONDUCTED A VERY EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF THE IRREGULARITY OCCURRED AT JFK.  AN INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE AGENT INCHARGE OF MAKING SURE THIS CARGO WAS LOADED IN THE CONTAINER TO BE LOADED ON THE AIRCRAFT.  HE CLEARLY STATED     THERE WAS NO IRREGULARITY.  THE CARGO WAS LOADED WITHOUT INCIDENT. 7.  THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED ON JUNE 5 AT JFK TO DETERMINE IF ANYONE SAW A D.G. IRREGULARITY ON JUNE 2, 2001.  ANOTHER INTENSIVE INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE AGENT INCHARGE OF LOADING THIS D.G. THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE PRESENT DURING THIS INTERVIEW.  AGAIN, THE AGENT ADVISED THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO IRREGULARITY. 8.  ON JUNE 6, 2001 JAL/JFK CONTACTED RADIAC ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO SIGN OF ANY D.G. IRREGULARITY AT JFK, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE WAREHOUSE IS SAFE.  NYC PUBLIC HEALTH WAS ALSO CONTACTED TO MAKE A CHECK OF THE WAREHOUSE.  A VERY DETAIL CHECK OF THE WAREHOUSE WAS MADE WITHOUT ANY SIGN OF ANY RADIOACTIVE CONTAMINATION. 9.  ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 6 ANOTHER INTERVIEW WAS MADE WITH THE AGENT INCHARGE OF LOADING THIS D.G. INTO THE LD3 CONTAINER.  INTERVIEWS WITH OTHER STAFF IN THE WAREHOUSE WERE ALSO CONDUCTED.  ONE OF THE WAREHOUSE STAFF HAD COME FORWARD AND ADVISED OF SOME SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY HE SAW ON THE EVENING OF JUNE 2, 2001.  WITHOUT INFORMING THE AGENT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOADING THIS D.G. INTO THE LD3, ANOTHER INTERVIEW WAS MADE WITH HIM.  HE AGAIN ADVISED THE D.G. WAS LOADED WITHOUT IRREGULARITY. 10.  ABOUT A HALF HOUR LATER, THE BUILD-UP AGENT CAME INTO MY OFFICE. PLEASE NOTE THIS IS THE EVENING OF JUNE 6, 2001.  HE SEEMED VERY NERVOUS. I BROUGHT OTHER WITNESSES INTO THE OFFICE.  THE AGENT ADMITS HE MISTAKENLY RAN OVER THE D.G. WITH  A FORKLIFT.  HE RETAPED THE PIECE AND LOADED IT INTO THE LD3 CONTAINER.  I ASKED HIM TO GIVE ME A SIGNED STATEMENT HE DID. 11.  ON JUNE 7 ANOTHER SURVEY OF THE WAREHOUSE WAS MADE BY NYC PUBLIC HEALTH.  THE WAREHOUSE WAS FOUND TO BE SAFE.  THE BUILD-UP AGENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOADING OF ALL CARGOES ONTO PALLETS AND INTO STRUCTURAL CONTAINERS.  HE MAKES SURE ALL CARGOES ARE PROPERLY COUNTED AND THE PALLET/CONTAINER IS PROPERLY WEIGHED AND TAGGED FOR WEIGHT'N BALANCE PURPOSES.  HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE D.G. ARE CORRECTLY LOADED WITHOUT ANY IRREGULARITY. ACTION TAKE TO PREVENT A SIMILAR D.G. INCIDENT A DOUBLE CHECK WILL NOW BE MADE FOR ALL D.G. LOADED ONTO PALLETS OR IN A STRUCTURAL CONTAINER.

SITE DESCRIPTION- ON  JUNE 15, 2001 AT APPROXIMATELY 10:20 A.M. A CIP/OXY PRIVATE FLEET DRIVER WAS DELIVERING A ^3500 GALLON T/T LOAD OF 50% SODIUM HYDROXIDE SOLUTION TO GRIFFIN LLC LOCATED AT 12701 ALMEDA RD., HOUSTON, TX.  THE DRIVER, MR. CLIFTON FOREMAN (EMPLOYED BY TRANSPORT DRIVERS, INC.), WAS MAKING HIS SECOND DELIVERY OF THE MORNING.  THE WEATHER WAS PARTLY CLOUDY, 93 F, WIND SE @ 20 MPH.  THE UNLOADING TANKS AND PRODUCT LINES AT GRIFFIN ARE LOCATED BEHIND THE MAIN WAREHOUSE ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE BUILDING.  THE TRANSFER AREA HAS A PARTIAL CONCRETE PAD AND IS ENCLOSED ON 3 SIDES BY CONCRETE RETAINING WALLS SURROUNDING PRODUCT STORAGE TANKS.  THE TRANSFER AREA HAS A SAFETY SHOWER AND HAS BEEN RECENTLY EQUIPPED WITH A SMALL AIR OPERATED SUMP PUMP TO REMOVE STORMWATER FROM THE CONCRETE PAD.  PRIOR ACTIONS TAKEN AND DEVIATIONS.  THE DRIVER PULLED INTO THE AREA AND BACKED THE TRAILER INTO THE UNLOADING AREA.  NO GRIFFIN OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE IN ATTENDANCE OR ASSISTED IN TRANSFER PREPARATION PROCEDURES.  UPON DISEMBARKING FROM THE TRACTOR MR. FOREMAN PUT ON SOME OF HIS PPE TO DO THE TRANSFER AND PROCEEDED TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER.  THE TRANSFER HOSE OWNED BY GRIFFIN FOR THE PRODUCT TRANSFER IS APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET LONG AND PERMANENTLY CONNECTED TO THE PRODUCT PIPING.  SOP CALLED FOR THE DRIVER TO BACK THE TRAILER SUFFICIENTLY FAR ENOUGH INTO THE AREA TO ATTACH THE PRODUCT HOSE.  IN DO SO, THE DRIVER ENTERED AN AREA WITH LITTLE ROOM FOR MOVING AROUND PIPING. THE DRIVER HAD DIFFICULTY OBTAINING PROPER CAMLOCK FITTING ALIGNMENT BECAUSE THE HOSE LENGTH WAS INSUFFICIENT.  SOP ALSO STATED THE DRIVER WAS TO ATTACH THE HOSE TO THE TRAILER OUTLET FITTING, OPEN THE TOP AIR VALVE, CONNECT PLANT AIR SUPPLY HOSE TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER, AND PRESSURIZE THE TRAILER TO APPROX. 25 PSIG.  THE DRIVER, BY HIS OWN ACCOUNT, DEVIATED FROM SOP DURING ATTACHMENT OF THE HOSE BECAUSE THE SUMP PUMP RAN DRY DISTRACTING HIM.  THE DRIVER STATED HE STOPPED FROM CONNECTING THE PRODUCT HOSE TO SHUT THE PUMP DOWN TO PREVENT DAMAGE.  MR. FOREMAN STATED HE DOES NOT REMEMBER BEING COMPLETELY SURE THAT THE HOSE CAMLOCK FITTINGS WERE COMPLETELY STRAIGHT AND CLAMPED IN PLACE.  THE HOSE CLAMPS WERE NOT SECURED.  ACCIDENT SUMMARY.  THE DRIVER STATED HE PARTIALLY OPENED THE EXTERNAL VALVE BECAUSE IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO OPERATE WITH PRODUCT PRESSURE APPLIED.  THE DRIVER THEN OPENED THE INTERNAL HYDRAULIC VALVE. THE CAMLOCK FITTING ON THE HOSE CAME LOOSE FROM THE TRAILER FITTING ALMOST INSTANTLY AND STRUCK MR. FOREMAN IN THE CHEST AREA KNOCKING HIM BACKWARD OVER THE RETAINING WALL TO HIS NORTH.
