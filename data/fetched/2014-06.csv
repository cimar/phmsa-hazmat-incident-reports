Flange stud bolt nuts on the liquid valve's mounting flange that were found less than tool tight were also tool tightened. All other valves and fittings were found secure. Non-evaporated spillage on the side shell and around the manway nozzle was wiped There was no ground impact from the spillage. Intact shipper seals were replaced by TIS seal 5201 at the manway closure and TIS seal 5202 at the protective housing cover. Response was concluded by 1045 hrs.

As part of their loading procedure the driver has to stop and take two samples to verify the water content in the oil is low enough.  Both samples came back above the authorized amount.  Driver was supposed to call in to his dispatcher when this happens.  He failed to do so.  Then the driver made the command decision to pump the oil back into the customer's tank.  At most well sites this wouldn't be an issue but at this location the tank happened to be a live production tank meaning it is continually filling.  As the driver pumped the oil from his trailer back into the customers tank the tank began overflowing.  Everything went into a containment area at this tank 'battery'.  USES was hired to come out and collect the contaminated soil in the containment area and clean the outside of the customer tank.,"This driver was fairly new to this type of business.  Driver has been shut down for future loads and is going to be spending time with one of our OSR's (Operations Safety Representatives) to go over the various sites and how they can differ, then reinforce our strict loading procedures and consequences if they aren't followed, and lastly a skills demonstration test to validate that the driver got the message and can perform the job tasks without incident.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,6000,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

The responders closed the liquid valve and secured its camlock closure cap by 1245 hrs. PDT, 6/04/2014 which ended any further commodity release from this fitting.    Contract responders were called-in for ground spill remediation and these responders reported over 2000 linear feet of stained ballast in the yard track from GROX 132050's commodity release while it was in motion. Impacted ballast and soils were excavated and the excavated site was treated with microbial bio-stimulate to remediate any remaining traces of spilled commodity. The excavation site was backfilled with native soils and topped with clean ballast. On 6/05/2014, contract responders degreased and pressure washed all spillage from GROX 132050.

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders immediately inspected GAMX 6537 and observed liquid commodity intermittently being expelled from GAMX 6537's reclosing pressure relief valve (which is indicative of a volume overfill condition). GAMX 6537 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard with containment placed under GAMX 6537 while awaiting commodity reduction. Contract responders removed approximately 1500 gallons from GAMX 6537 into a tanker truck for ultimate delivery to the consignee. Also included in that scheduled delivery was the spilled commodity captured in the containment receptacle that was placed under GAMX 6537. Measured commodity outage in GAMX 6537 was 2 inches before commodity reduction and 10 inches after the commodity reduction. After the reduction, no further commodity release was observed from the pressure relief valve. All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure. The spillage on GAMX 6537 was wiped, degreased and pressure washed. Observed ground spillage was excavated and the excavation site was treated with microbial bio-stimulate to remediate any remaining traces of spilled commodity. The excavated site was backfilled with native soils and topped with clean ballast.

This damage sustained to SGAX 1068 necessitated transfer of the commodity within SGAX 1068 into another suitable tank car.   On 6/10/2014, the contract responders assigned to make this commodity transfer were engaged in a pre-transfer assessment of SGAX 1068 when they noticed a commodity odor emanating from SGAX 1068 and commodity staining around SGAX 1068's manway nozzle and on its side shell. Further inspection into SGAX 1068's manway securement revealed that the manway gasket was missing. A new manway nozzle gasket was installed and SGAX 1068's manway closure was properly re-secured and sealed. Also, the liquid valve's closure plug was found less than tool tight with this valve in the closed position. The responders' tool tightened the liquid valve's closure plug. Intact shipper seals numbered 9700856 and 9700857 were replaced by seals numbered 872372 and 872378.

The conductor switching the tank car was slightly splashed on his ears and neck area with the released material.  The conductor decontaminated the area with water and refused any additional medical treatment.  The car was isolated and the shipper, Honeywell International was contacted via CHEMTREC report number 2014-0624-00277.  HEPACO, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found the cause of the release was due to a misaligned fill hole cover gasket.  The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to Honeywells representative Dennis Evan at 440-708-8202.  Contractor personnel properly aligned the gasket, secured the fill hole bolts/nuts with a wrench and decontaminated the container.  The leak was secured and the car was released to destination.

Investigation of the odor source resulted in finding tank car UTLX 27532 emanating a commodity odor in the railyard. UTLX 27532 was cordoned-off in the railyard and all switching operations ceased. Authorities recommended an evacuation of two business entities adjacent to the railyard, but the evacuation was not fully implemented due to their normal business closure time was imminent. One employee from the Lafayette Utilities System (LUS) complained of inhalation exposure and was taken to a local medical facility for examination and was released afterwards.   Inspection of UTLX 27532 determined the reclosing pressure relief valve (PRV) was venting and was the odor source. Responders placed a capping kit over the PRV to seal off commodity vapors. Afterwards, UTLX 27532 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard further away from the neighboring community. UTLX 27532 continued to be monitored. The probable cause of the PRV vent was commodity overloading of UTLX 27532. Air monitoring was initiated and continued through-out the commodity transfer process with no unacceptable air quality issues found in the railyard and the adjacent/nearby residential and business communities.   On 6/06/2014 contract responders arrived to set-up and begin transfer of the commodity from UTLX 27532 into two other suitable railcars. The commodity transfer began at 1230 hrs. CDT and stopped at 1930 hrs. CDT due to impending darkness per the request from the in charge Louisiana State Police representative. On 6/07/2014 the transfer of the commodity resumed at 0645 hrs. CDT and was completed by 1630 hrs. CDT without further incident. These two receiving tank cars were forwarded to the shipper facility at Lake Charles, LA. On 6/08/2014 all chlorine vapors were removed from UTLX 27532 and scrubbed into totes of 20% caustic solution. After pressure within UTLX 27532 was 0 psi and then a vacuum condition noted, UTLX 27532's PRV was removed and replaced with another suitable PRV.",The shipper has initiated corrective action with procedural changes to ensure rail cars are not overloaded.,Yes,TANK CAR,,105J500W,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,200000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Upon realization of the release the driver contacted his dispatcher who initiated an in house response. The response crew donned the proper PPE and remediated the impacted area by deploying the appropriate absorbent material.

As the drum came down on the dock the bottom of the container split open approximately nine inches releasing an estimated 15 gallons of material.  The driver estimated the container dropped approximately 3-5 inches from the rear of the trailer to the loading dock.  The spilled product was immediately cleaned up with absorbent and pig pads and placed into an overpack recovery drum that was returned to the shipping site.  The Univar driver cleaned the spill with no assistance from the customer or an outside agency.,The supplier of the product was informed of the incident.  They completed an investigation that included contacting the drum manufacture (Grief).  They reported no other similar incidents with this product or container type.

Contract responders inspecting CGTX 30461 reported the leak source was at the base of the liquid valve that was loose on its threaded connection onto its mounting flange's pipe riser. Also, the liquid valve's applied thread sealant appeared old with signs of degradation. The valve's threaded area was cleaned and new PTFE pipe thread sealant was applied. The liquid valve was then properly tool tightened on its threaded connection. The vapor valve was also removed and its threaded area was cleaned with new pipe thread sealant applied. The vapor valve was re-applied on its threaded connection and tool tightened. CGTX 30461 was pressurized to 15 psi by inserting compressed nitrogen and no further leakage from the liquid valve fitting was observed. All other valves and fittings were inspected and found secure.

Fisher has reported to us when contacted about this valve, that they no longer recommend this valve for transport vehicles, although no recall was in place. A communication from Fisher to transport owners, transport test and repair facilities  would seem to be in order.  As of the date of this follow up report, 01/22/2015, Fisher has issued a voluntary safety recall on these valves used in transport vehicles.

The specific facts of the accident are not known.  The accident caused the Demeter Transport truck to lay over on its side.  This caused the tank on the Demeter Transport truck to rupture leaking approximately 1000 gallons of liquid fertilizer onto the roadway and soil on the side of the highway.    US Environmental Services were called to the scene to perform the clean up of the spill.  They excavated 280 cubic yards of soil from the shoulder of the highway and took it to Eagle Pass Municipal Landfill for disposal.  At the time of clean up the soil was PH'd and verified it was neutral and not acidic.    The roadway was pressure washed prior to the excavation.

Cause of the release was due to an improperly secured manway cover.  Inspection by response personnel revealed the manway nozzle gasket to be in poor condition and mis-positioned on the manway nozzle.  1 swingbolt in the 4 o'clock position was not in place, and when properly positioned and tightened, the swingbolt at the 6 o'clock position fell from place.  Upon proper placement, and tightening of remaining 7 less than wrench tight swingbolts, the release was minimized to a minor drip and contained within a portable tub.  Further inspection of the car revealed that the manway cover was not impacted or struck resulting from the car rolling onto its right side.  Upon rerailing of the car, there was no further release of product.  On 7-10-14, remaining product in the damaged car was transferred into tank car GAMX 5520 for further handling by the shipper.  Responding environmental contractors recovered released product with the use of a vacuum truck, and excavation of product saturated soil.","Conduct proper pre and post inspection of car upon completion of loading or unloading, to ensure all valves, fittings and closures are in a closed and secure condition preventing release of liquid, vapor or gas while car is in transportation.",Yes,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,75000,Union Pacific Railroad,US,

June 30, 2014: While vessel was enroute to the USA, the Master reported leakage from container KKTU 7468640 onto the hatch over.  July 9, 2014: Container KKTU774358 (belonging to the same cargo interests) and stowed on top of the first container was also noted leaking which spilled on top and side of the lower container.  Measures taken by the Vessel included:  • Use of drip trays were used to collect the continuous slow drip of liquid.  Approximately 1.5 liters was collected in the drip trays, however, a more substantial amount leaked on the deck and was noted on the hatch cover that the containers were stowed on and on the deck nearby.    •The Vessel ensured there was no heat source, cordoned off the area and crew members were not let close due to the inhalation hazard.    •Incident details were recorded by the Vessel as SOP    USCG issued a Safety Order which was later rescinded.  USCG required the leaking containers be discharged as 1st US Port of Call at Maher Terminals in Newark, NJ after reviewing and approving a Response Plan drawn up by Gallagher Marine (QI).    All actions (July 9-11) upon discharge were approved by the USCG who mostly were in attendance.  Cargo was transloaded into other ocean containers upon clean up.     The Surveyor noted the solid crystals at ambient temps, is hydroscopic and apparently absorbed moisture from the air in transit from high humidity and temperature variations causing some of it to liquefy, as it is soluble.  The liquid flowed out of the NON-WATER TIGHT bags IBCs (13H4).  When the  liquid evaporated later over a period of days, the remaining residue in white powder form was left on the deck and hatch covers.      1.5 Liters (collected in drip trays, HOWEVER, a larger quantity was released onto the Vessel.  Vessel did not provide estimated amount though.","The surveyor advised that it appears the Insufficient Packing was a direct cause of the leak, which could have been prevented if the product had been shipped in plastic drums, for example.",No,IBC,"Plastic, coated with liner, for solids",13H4,Yes,,,,ZZ,,,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,30000,"""K"" Line America Inc.",US,

A vehicle operated by Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc was en route from the shipper’s location to the intended waste management facility.  During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop at a 10 day transfer facility for the purpose of consolidating less than truck load quantities on a single transport vehicle for continued transportation. During the transfer operation, the over-pack drum was discovered to be reacting causing an escape of  approximately 5 gallons.  The contingency spill plan was effected.  All proper notification was made.  The local Fire Department was notified and was on site so as to ensure no further reaction.  In-house response team suited up using proper personal protection equipment, removed the drum from the truck, and placed it in a containment area.  With the material stabelized and identified as Hydrochloric Acid, it was then overpacked into a suitable over-pack drum.  All areas of the truck, drums and surrounding area were neutralized and decontaminated.    In addition, all clean-up debris were collected and placed into am appropriate salvage drum. Once completed, the container was marked, labeled, secured and then placed onto a trailer for continued transportation.","A Management Team Investigation was conducted.  We retested the drum and found it did not contain Malonic Acid (as designated by the generator, Allied Building), rather Hydrochloric Acid.  The profile was immediately expired and we contacted the generator.  We went back to the generator to educate and discuss the fact that SKS was acting on generator knowledge and that all must be certain of what is being packaged and prepared for transport. And if the generator is uncertain then we need to have appropriate samples pulled to determine up front what will be disposed of.  We also conducted training and counseling sessions with the Field Representative, the Market Sales Specialist and the Customer Service Manager on how a drum of this nature should be handled and addressed before picking it up in the future. Part of the retraining was proper drum handling procedures as well as overpacking a drum.  This training was also conducted to the whole branch to make sure it was stressed with all associates who handle these types of situations.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,14013,"Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc",US,

A GEC EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED MATERIAL LEAKING FROM THE BALL VALVE GASKET AT 1900 ON 06-22-14. THE EMPLOYEE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE SUPERVISOR ON CALL AND BEGAN TAKING STEPS TO CONTAIN THE SPILL USING ABSORBENT PADS. ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES RESPONDED AT ONCE, EACH OF WHICH HAS BEEN TRAINED TO, AT LEAST, THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TECHNICIAN LEVEL AS DEFINED AT 29 CFR 1910.120(Q)(6)(III).WORKERS ISOLATED THE EQUIPMENT. IN ADDITION, TEAM MEMBERS CREATED A DIRT BERM AND CATCH POND TO PREVENT THE PRODUCT FROM ENTERING THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. INSPECTION OF THE LEAKING UNIT RESULTED IN THE DETERMINATION THAT THE GASKET BETWEEN THE TANK AND THE REAR AIR-ACTUATED VALVE FAILED, CAUSING THE SPM TO LEAK OUT AND TO EXPOSE EQUIPMENT PARTS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE ACID. THE LEAK WAS INITIALLY SLOWED BY TIGHTENING THE AFFECTED BOLTS CONNECTING THE REAR VALVE TO THE TANK. EQUIPMENT TO TRANSFER THE REMAINING PRODUCT FROM THE LEAKING TANKER WAS LOCATED AND MOBILIZED TO THE SITE. AT APPROXIMATELY 01:30 ON 06-23-14, THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT ARRIVED ON SITE AND THE REMAINING PRODUCT WAS TRANSFERRED INTO TT-219. THE TRANSFERRED MATERIAL WAS DELIVERED TO THE CONSIGNEE'S DESIGNATED LOCATION ON 06-23-14. REMEDIATION BEGAN IMMEDIATELY UPON ACHIEVING CONTAINMENT. THE LIQUID IN THE CONTAINMENT AREA WAS NEUTRALIZED USING AN ACTIVATED CAUSTIC SODA MIXTURE THEN PUMPED INTO TOTES (275-GALLON PORTABLE TANKS). SOIL IN THE AREA WAS ALSO NEUTRALIZED USING A POWDER FORM OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CAUSTIC SODA MIXTURE. AFFECTED SOIL WAS THEN REMOVED AND PLACED IN TEN (10) 25 YARD ROLL OFF BOXES. EQUIPMENT AND SURFACES WERE DECONTAMINATED WITH WATER THAT WAS ALSO CONTAINERIZED FOR TESTING TO ENSURE NON-HAZARDOUS PROPERTIES. PPE WAS PACKAGED FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.   SOIL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM THE CATCH POND AND DOWN GRADE AREA: ONE WAS TAKEN FROM EACH OF THE FOUR SIDES, ONE FROM THE BOTTOM, AND MORE EVERY 20-30 FEET FROM THE CATCH POND AREA IN THE DIRECTION OF POTENTIAL RUN-OFF FOR 150 FEET. ALL SAMPLES WERE EVALUATED AND DETERMINE TO BE UNCONTAMINATED BASED ON PH RESULTS OF A NEUTRAL NATURE. CONFIRMATION SAMPLES WERE SENT TO A CERTIFIED LABORATORY FOR EVALUATION.  THE HOLE WAS LINED WITH POLY TARP AND BACKFILLED WITH 1’ LIFTS. ONCE CONFIRMATION SAMPLES WERE RETURNED AS ACCEPTABLE, BASE MATERIAL WAS ADDED TO MATCH EXISTING GRADE. ALL CONTAMINATED SOIL AND MATERIALS IS CURRENTLY BEING CHARACTERIZED AND PROFILED FOR DISPOSAL INTO A PROPERLY PERMITTED TSDF.
