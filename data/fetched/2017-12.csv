They discovered a 275 gallon IBC leaking from the valve area. The material was transferred into a new tote. The leaking tote was found to have a crack in the hub where the valve mounts to the IBC tank. The emptied leaking tote was then  cut up and placed with the clean up debris into 4 55 gallon poly drums. The spilled acid was neutralized, absorbed and cleaned up and the debris placed into the poly drums mentioned before.

The driver and company technician both donned the correct personal protective equipment and repacked the paint cans loaded within this leaking CYB into a new UN rated CYB, taking care to check the individual paint can closures, making sure the cans were placed upright and secured from movement, and added the appropriate absorbents to the bottom of the box as a protective measure. All waste materials generated from the cleanup were placed inside the new CYB, including the leaking package.     The leaking CYB was found to contain inner paint cans that were not tightly closed, and was also found to have a small puncture (of an undetermined origin) in the liner. No absorbent had been used while originally packaging.     This was reported to the State of CT DEEP on 12/04/2017 at 13:51 EST, report #201706302.","At the time this package was placed into transportation, there was no evidence of a release or package integrity issue. We have contacted the generator, and asked them to take greater care in packaging this waste paint material, paying special attention to the each paint can closure, the orientation of these cans within the cubic yard box, and the use of absorbents at the bottom of each box. We have also asked the generator to ask its personnel to take greater care when placing these cans into the cubic yard box,  so as not to cause any tears, abrasions, or punctures to the inner liner.",No,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc.,US,

This happened inside a box van, and only the floor of that trailer was impacted; no soil, water, or asphalt were affected. An emergency response crew was summoned. This crew, wearing the correct personal protective equipment, found the drum to have a small pinhole near the bottom chime, which suggests interior corrosion or and off specification waste stream. The crew over packed the leaking drum into a UN rated salvage over pack drum, along with all the waste generated from the cleanup of the trailer floor. The drum continued onto to its final destination without further incident.     The release did not meet the reporting requirements for the State of Ohio.","At the time this package was placed into transportation, there was no evidence of a release or issue. We  have asked the generator to investigate the possibility that this waste stream was off-specification.

There was minimal traffic on the road. No ice present & dry road conditions. Driver described product surging after he'd come out of a curve. He explained that the truck was swaying side to side causing him to drift into another lane. As he began to drift into another lane he turned his wheel to correct the direction of travel; the truck responded and he attempted to correct the action again. He explained that the truck began to head towards a guard wall which protects traffic from going into the Jones Falls Stream. Upon seeing the direction of travel he stated that he applied the brakes, thus resulting in him losing control of the vehicle. Phillip was taken to Sinai Hospital 2401 West Belvedere Ave. Baltimore, Maryland where he was seen by Tara L. Ong MD. Phillip sustained no injuries and was provided a note stating that he could return to work 12/29/17. The DriveCam footage was retrieved from truck 1043 and reviewed. The footage displayed Phillip dozing off behind the wheel. The vehicle began to drift towards the guard wall, and Phillip overcompensated his attempted recovery which caused the rollover. Phillip clocked in at 06:10 am on Tuesday 12/26/17. Phillip did not work Sunday 12/24/17 and did not work Monday 12/25/17. The product released into the Jones Falls Stream in being collected at 1901 Falls Rd. Baltimore, MD. This area was selected by the heads of MDE and ACE Environmental to provide the least amount of contact with the public and to minimize environmental harm.

As driver was navigating down Murphy Road in Belton, SC the driver allowed the truck to travel off of the road edge on the right side, causing the truck to track off of the roadway and result in an overturn. The driver immediately notified 911 which responded. The driver then notified his Safety Officer, which immediately dispatched a remediation crew. The tank was leaking out of a crushed vapor valve, which the fire department placed a pan under to collect the leak until remediation crew could arrive. Remediation crew cut two 4"" holes in the side of the tank to allow pumping out of the product in the tank. Once the drill broke the seal of the tank, the product started to leak but was caught by the drain pans. Once the vehicle was pumped completely out, the truck was turned back over and towed away. The environmental crew excavated a small area where the soil was contaminated, tests were conducted to make sure all product was removed, and then the excavation was backfilled and restored to its original condition. COmplete remediation was completed 12/28/2017.","This incident was attributable to driver error.

Driver secured drums and IBC to wall with ratchet straps at approximately 48"" level off floor. location was near front of trailer.    Driver then made multiple pickups over a 3 to 4 hour span, proceeding towards home terminal. At last pickup 60 minutes from home terminal, he noticed that chemical smell in trailer had increased, but was still in tolerable range, which is not out of the norm with these moves.     On arrival to terminal, strong, irritating, chemical odor was detected immediately upon opening of rollup door, and there was liquid of unknown origin on floor at rear. Supervisor on duty immediately contacted me, I then provided guidance to remove trailer from door and place in yard to minimize exposure. Specific instruction was given to place unit away from storm drains or unpaved areas. Shop personnel was prepared to place dirt and absorbent materials on the asphalt, as well as having containers ready to catch any significant leakage from trailer. These steps were not necessary, leakage from trailer itself was negligible.    EPS of VT was contacted, they have a facility on same street as ours, and they had staff on scene in approximately 60 minutes. They contained the material, then cleaned and neutralized residue in trailer. Material in damaged IBC was transferred to an intact vessel. EPS moved all waste material from site on manifest 009844284.    EPS discovered that ratchet mechanism of strap used to secure IBC to vehicle twisted inward, allowing stamped-steel edge of mechanism to chafe/cut into IBC at a height of approximately 48"" from floor. Material in IBC above that height then leaked through slice.    Duration of leak is unknown and appears to have slowed significantly once vehicle motion stop. We believe material loss to be less than 15 gallons.","Guidance given to driver in regards to using protective material, such as cardboard, a wooden pallet that pulls mechanism away from IBC, or utilizing blocking/bracing vs strap when the above methods are not possible.",No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,7961,Land Air llc,US,

Berner driver coming out of the curve did not have ample time to avoid the truck in the roadway (no lights on disabled truck) and tried to avoid him and left roadway into median where truck rolled over in median causing material to leak out. Notifications were made immediately to appropriate authorities (NRC, Florida state warning point, SWS Cleanup). Approx. 2700 gallons of Gasoline and Diesel fuel were released.",It is not known for certain but from the information received it was alleged that the driver who's truck crossed travel lanes and rolled over into the northbound lanes had put his truck in cruise control (drivers words) and lost control. It is our fear that the driver may have fell asleep. I do not know that to be certain but it is my fear.

At the time of the interior inspection the unit was not actively leaking. Cargo inspection revealed a mix load of palletized 55 gallon drums and 5 gallon  containers stowed two rows wide one layer high. The load was secured with two plies of tyguard, laminated wood blocking at the rear two pallets, with a DID airbag applied inbetween the centerline void as a form of secondary securement. A pallet of 5 gallon containers placed at the nose section of the unit has collapsed to the left side, falling onto the adjacent pallet spilling approximately 3 ounces of product onto the adjacent pallet.

During rerailing operations at approximately 0950 on 12/22/17 it was discovered that a small amount of product, approximately 1 gallon, had leaked from the liquid valve body.  The cause of the leak was damage incurred during the derailment as the car rolled partially onto its top, cracking the valve body.  Environmental contractor Clean Harbors was dispatched to assist with cleanup and remediation.  Car sustained significant damage and its contents will be transloaded and the car will be cleaned and dismantled.","Cause of derailment is under investigation.

Driver reported preparing load paperwork for transportation, inspecting the loaded containers of materials from the rear of the trailer, and ensuring load securement bar was in place.  The driver departed the facility at approximately 1730EST and encountered slow/sporadic traffic on Highway 59.  The driver reported that as traffic began to clear, another vehicle merged into his lane and slowed down, resulting in a deceleration event to avoid collision.  The driver reported feeling load movement and seeing a mist near the trailer mud flap.  The driver immediately pulled to the emergency shoulder to investigate, contacted the emergency telephone number from the shipping document (Clean Harbors), placed out emergency triangles, and place absorbent pads where material was dripping from the trailer.  The driver then notified Neier, Inc. parties of the incident and confirmed there were no waterways or drainage systems impacted by the event.  The driver remained in contact with Clean Harbors Emergency Response after initial notification call at 1730.  Response crew arrived at the incident scene at 2000 to investigate and respond to leaking material.  The crew reported multiple drums had fallen off of the pallets, 4 drums were punctured and leaking, and a presence of standing liquid in the trailer.  The leaking drums were over-packed and standing liquid from the trailer was pumped back into one of the drums.  The trailer was cleaned and reorganized.  The impacted concrete/dirt was cleaned/removed and contained in a drum, along with used sorbents, pads, and materials.  The response crew reports completion of scene clean up at 2300.","After the trailer was opened and inspected by the response crew, the Neier driver reported that there were large gaps/open spaces between packages near the middle and front of the trailer although there was not in the rear of lead near the load securement bar.  This indicates additional load securement bars should have been placed near the gaps to further secure the drums on the pallet(s), or that the packages should have been loaded closer together to prevent containers from shifting within the trailer during transit.  Proper visual inspection of containers and ensuring proper load securement was discussed with the Neier drive.  Additionally, the shipper began using multiple securement straps throughout the load, in addition to the rear load securement bar.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Neier, Inc.",US,

At 1215 ET, an M.C. Tank driver of Truck #2547 was unloading at a customer location when he was inadvertently sprayed (estimated 1 pint to 1 quart released) with UN2582 Ferric Chloride (material being unloaded), the driver immediately took off the impacted clothing and placed them in the truck and left the site. During driving, the driver felt light-headed and dizzy, pulled over, contacted 911 and the driver has been transported to the hospital. The driver was on I-95 around exit 25 in Philadelphia, PA. HEPACO arrived on site and removed impacted clothing from the truck and a relief driver continued on transport of the material.     On December 27, 2017 at 0822 ET, M.C. Tank requested HEPACO return to the holding yard (located at 3201 North Delaware Ave in Philadelphia, PA) contractors go to the holding yard for the trailer and clean up a residual spill from the trailer that is in puddles and a Catch basin at the yard. HEPACO returned to site and it appears that the tanker released an estimated 10 Gallons of Ferric Chloride material due to a leak in the valve of the tanker. Team secured the release and changed the valve on the trailer and set up the area to have a transfer be performed into a new trailer.     On December 28th, HEPACO returned to site and performed the transfer into a relief trailer. During the transfer operation, another estimated 5 Gallons released to the asphalt of the transfer yard.

He was using between 28-30 PSI when the spill occurred. He stated that his hoses were vibrating like they were empty so he went inside to check the receiving tank and that is when he discovered that product was pouring out of the top of the customer’s tank. His first response was to close the shut-off valve on the tank but could not because of the product spilling around that area. He then went to the trailer and shut the valve which stopped the leak.,Awareness messages have been sent to our entire fleet of drivers reminding them to never exceed 15 PSI for any unload following this incident.

The release occurred in a concrete containment area; no soil or water sources were impacted. A field service crew wearing the correct personal protective equipment was dispatched to over-pack the drum into a correctly rated UN salvage over-pack drum. The waste generated from the cleanup was also placed in the over-pack drum. This drum continued to its final destination without further incident.     It was determined that drum did not have a visible UN rating, and the pinhole that caused the release was likely due to internal corrosion, deterioration, or incompatible waste.     This release fell below the State of Ohio reporting threshold.","The driver who picked up this drum was given retraining on package inspection, with an emphasis on checking for a visible UN specification on packages containing hazardous materials.

IT WAS A USED TWO COMPARTMENT TANK, THAT WE JUST ACQUIRED FROM THE PURCHASE OF KENNY STRICKLAND INC. WE MOUNTED IT ON A NEW 2019 KW CHASSIS. THE TANK WAS TRANSFERRED FROM AN OLD OUT OF SERVICE TRUCK, THE TRANSFER WAS PERFORMED BY EMPIRE TANKER REPAIR, THEY TRANSFERRED THE BODY AND PERFORMED ALL THE TESTING. THEY PERFORMED A 5 YEAR VKIP AND DID ANY REPAIRS TO BRING IT INTO COMPLIANCE (INVOICE ATTACHED) AND ALSO PERFORMED THE ANNUAL LEAK TEST FOR ARB. ALL THIS WORK WAS DONE ON 10/27/17, PLUS THEY CERTIFIED THE TEST FOR THE COLTON SHELL RACK ON 11/2/17. ON 12/22/17, THE TRUCK WAS TRANSFERRED FOR OUR EL CAJON SHOP TO OUR CALIMESA YARD TO BE PUT INTO SERVICE. OUR DRIVER WENT TO COLTON COMMUNITY RACK ON SOUTH RIVERSIDE AVE, TO LOAD A FULL LOAD CLEAR ULS CARB DIESEL. HE LOADED HIS TRAILER AND THEN THE TRUCK. THE TRUCK TANK HAS TWO COMPARTMENTS, HE LOADED THE REAR COMPARTMENT FIRST AND WAS FINISHING THE FRONT COMPARTMENT WHEN THE LEAK WAS FOUND. HE STARTED LOADING THE FRONT COMPARTMENT, WHEN HE NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A LEAK COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK UNDER THE FRONT COMPARTMENT. HE STOPPED THE PUMP AND WAS LOOKING UNDER THE TRUCK, TRYING TO SEE WHERE THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM. HE NOTIFIED THE TERMINAL OPERATOR AT KINDER MORGAN, THEN HE CALLED HIS DISPATCHER ON CALL. THE TERMINAL OPERATOR CAME TO OVER HELP. WE COULDN’T FIGURED OUT WHY THE TANK WAS LEAK, WHEN IT WAS JUST CERTIFIED BY EMPIRE TANKER REPAIR FOR SERVICE. WE CONTACTED DALE MARCHANT, THE OWNER OF EMPIRE TANKER FOR HELP. OUR DISPATCHER AND FLEET MGR. WERE IN CONTACT WITH THE OPERATOR JACOB HORNSBY FROM KINDER MORGAN, ON WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND HE SAID, DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT, WE’VE MADE THE NECESSARY “BARE BONES” REPORTING. ONCE DALE FROM EMPIRE TANKER SHOWED UP, HE DETERMINED THAT A PLUG WAS LEFT OUT AFTER THE TESTING WAS DONE! AT THAT DALE, TOLD SOCO AND KINDER MORGAN, THAT HIS COMPANY WAS TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND WOULD COVER ANY COST OR FINES. ON 12/27/17, A FOLLOW UP CALL WAS MADE BY OUR COO TO KINDER MORGAN AND WAS TOLD TO ASK FOR GENE (909-877-2141). GENE SAID THEY WERE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH EMPIRE TANKER AND NOTHING ELSE WAS NEED FROM SOCO.","FIRST OF ALL, I WISH THE KINDER MORGAN OPERATOR WOULD HAVE TOLD ME, I NEED TO REPORT THE SPILL TO THE NRC. I’M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE MAKING THAT CALL. WHEN IT COMES TO KINDER MORGAN, THEY HAVE VERY STRICT RULES IN PLACE AND IF WE DON’T FOLLOW THEM, WE CAN BE KICKED OUT FOR A SET AMOUNT OF TIME. SO, WHEN THE OPERATOR TELLS US THAT HE’S GOT IT HANDLED, I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL TAKEN CARE OF, BUT NOW I KNOW THAT’S NOT THE CASE. IN FUTURE, IF SOMETHING EVER HAPPENS LIKE THIS AGAIN, I WILL BE SURE TO REPORT IT MYSELF.     SECOND OF ALL, WE TRUSTED THIS CERTIFIED SHOP (EMPIRE TANKER REPAIR) TO PERFORM THE PROPER TEST AND CERTIFY THE TRUCK WAS READY FOR OPERATIONS. THIS SPILL WOULD HAVE OCCURRED, NO MATTER WHERE THE FIRST LOAD WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE, WE’RE JUST GLAD IT WAS IN A PLACE THAT HAD TOTAL CONTAINMENT AND NOTHING LEFT THE PROPERTY, ALSO, WE ARE GLAD THAT THIS INCIDENT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON A PUBLIC STREET, WHERE THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A BIGGER PROBLEM.

The part was trucked from Orlando Airport (MCO) to TPA where it was decided it was no longer needed as another means was developed to repair the aircraft.  Efforts were then made to expedite the part to back to JetBlue.  Since the part had been transported by truck from Orlando, it was identified as non-hazardous by ground with no Hazmat paperwork or markings to indicate that it was hazardous.  Therefore the Store Materials Logistics Specialist (MLS) who was new to the position made the erroneous determination that the part was new and therefore contained no fuel.  The MLS was focused on expediting the part to American Airlines in Charlotte (CLT) for processing to return to JetBlue.  As a result, the fuel unit was shipped on American Airlines Flight 1810 undeclared.

The offloading was then resumed without further incident.","Upon return of the cargo tank to the plant, the maintenance team completed a 5 why investigation. The crossover valve which is where the leak was noted,  is a 1” cam-tite valve which should be in the closed position during offloading. In order for this valve to leak through the stem while closed it would require a double failure. The valve would have to leak past the ball seat and also through the stem seals. The valve was found to have the wrong size nut clip installed. This issue has been identified previously, and there are corrective actions currently in place to address it on all 15 affected trailers.

Leak test of unloading hose did not identify any leaks. After several minutes of offloading, wisping of HF vapors were seen originating from the unloading hose of the cargo tank. Unloading ceased, and hose was inspected. A small gash was discovered in the hose approximately 30-31 inches from the flange on the end of the hose that connects to the hard pipe.  Another off-load hose was brought to the location to successfully unload the cargo tank.  The damaged hose was rinsed with water and a soda ash solution. Blind flanges were installed and hose was secured in the hose trough for the trip back to the plant. Upon close examination of the Resistoflex hose and root cause analysis by the plant reliability team determined the following:   • The hose was cut apart to view all the layers.  The inner Teflon liner had a pinhole opening.  The inside of the outer carcass had splayed cracking as if a blunt force had been applied.  The outside of the carcass had the visible split or gash. • At the point of the gash, there is an open space between the cargo tank and bumper whereby road debris could possibly be kicked up and strike the hose.   • The team attempted to recreate the damage on another similar hose and could do so only with extreme force using a mallet.  Attempting to cut the hose with a box cutter also failed. • Temperatures at the time were unusually cold.  However, the location of the gash was near the hard pipe connection.  This point is away from the points of the hose which are normally twisted and otherwise manipulated.  If there were failure due to extreme temperature, it would have been at those points.  Additionally, the hose is rated to -20°F and has not otherwise failed due to temperature extremes.","The resulting corrective actions from the RCA process are:  • Replace current Resistoflex hoses with HFIPI industry approved Resistoflex steel over steel, Teflon lined hoses.  Hoses are on order and will be replaced as cargo tanks return to plant. • Bolting a shield to the trailer to cover the open space so the hose won’t be struck by road debris.  Shield installation will occur on planned maintenance scheduled for the cargo tank. • Procedures will be modified to include hand-over-hand visual inspections of hose prior to shipment and prior to unloading.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Honeywell,US,
