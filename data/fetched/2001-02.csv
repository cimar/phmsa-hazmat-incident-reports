THE ENGLAND DRIVER WAS GOING UP THE BLUE MOUNTAIN PASS (CABBAGE HILL) VERY SIMILAR TO THE GRAPEVINE.  THE BAROMETRIC PRESSURE FORCED SOME PARAQUAT OUT OF THE TOP OF ONE OF THE 20 TOTES.  THE REASON DISCOVERED HOW THE POISON WAS RELEASED WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT SOMEONE PRIOR TO SHIPPING REPLACED A TOP DISPENSING VALVE WITH AN UNAUTHORIZED VALVE.  AS A RESULT THE IMPROPER VALVE WAS OPEN AND ALLOWED THE SIPHON TO TAKE PLACE AS THE TRAILER WAS PULLED UP THE PASS. THE DRIVER WAS UNAWARE OF THE SPILL.  A CITIZEN CALLED THE STATE PATROL. THE STATE PATROL PULLED OVER THE DRIVER AND LOOKED AT THEIR FREIGHT BILLS. THE STATE PATROL CALLED THE ONTARIO FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THE I-84 FREEWAY WAS SHUT DOWN FOR APPROX. 4 HOURS.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT LOOKED AT THE CHEMICAL AND CALLED STEVE RITCH ENVIRONMENTAL.  STEVE REQUESTED LINEHAUL TO HAVE A CLEAN ENGLAND TRAILER PULLED TO THE ODOT SAND SHED (MILE POST 268 WHERE THEY COULD SWING THE FREIGHT.  PASCO PULLED OUT A CLEAN ENGLAND EMPTY TRAILER TO THE SITE.  STEVE AND HIS CREW HAD ON FULL PPE.  THEY PLACED THE DRY FREIGHT INTO THE CLEAN ENGLAND TRAILER.   ANY WET OR CONTAMINATED FREIGHT WAS PLACED ON PLASTIC SHEETING ON THE GROUND.  AFTER THE ORIGINAL WET TRAILER WAS EMPTIED SOMEONE PULLED IT TO A TRUCK WASH TO BE DECONTAMINATED.  ALL THE RINSE WATER WAS CAPTURED IN 55 GALLON DRUMS, CURRENTLY SITTING IN BAKER CITY. AFTER THE CLEAN UP WAS COMPLETED, THERE WAS A GUARD SERVICE HIRED FOR THE ODOT SAND SHED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM THE POISON.  THE SERVICE WAS PAID 45.00/HR FOR APPROX. 40 HOURS.  THERE WAS HIGH WINDS THAT KEPT BLOWING OVER THE FREIGHT THAT WAS STACKED ON THE GROUND.  FOR SAFETY REASONS ALL THE FREIGHT WAS MOVED TO A SECURED AND PROTECTED YARD IN BAKER CITY.  SINCE THE CLEAN TRAILER WAS NOW CONTAMINATED FROM TAIL LOADING ON THE WET FREIGHT, ENGLAND HAD TO PULL ANOTHER CLEAN EMPTY TO BAKER CITY.  (NOTE:  STEVE RITCH ALSO OWNS A TOWING SERVICE AND ENGLAND HAS AN ACCOUNT WITH HIM)  STEVE REPORTED TO THE DEQ AND THE OREGON HEALTH DEPARTMENT THAT THE CAUSE OF THE SPILL WAS FROM THE WRONG VALVE BEING INSTALLED ON ONE OF THE TOTES.  JOHN KURK WAS THE PERSON IN CHARGE FROM THE ONTARIO FIRE DEPARTMENT.  HE HAS 4/5 ROLLS OF PHOTO TAKEN ON THE SCENE.  STEVE ALSO HAS APPROX. 4/5 ROLLS OF 35 MM PHOTOS TAKEN SO FAR.  I HAVE COPIES OF A FEW KEY SHOTS SHOWING THE B/O VALVE AND THE DAMAGE TO OTHER FREIGHT AND EQUIPMENT.  STEVE STATES HE HAS MANY PHONE HOURS LOGGED WITH OUR LINEHAUL DEPARTMENT, SEVERAL HOURS WITH OREGON DEQ MIKE RENZ, AND ADDITIONAL HOURS TO BE CHARGED TALKING WITH OREGON HEALTH DEPARTMENT, ONTARIO FIRE DEPARTMENT INCLUDING THE MANUFACTURE CENJENTA (DON PAULSON-CHEMIST) THE SHIPPER AGRILIANCE WAS ALSO CONTACTED AND THEY REQUESTED ALL 20 TOTES BE DELIVERED BACK TO THEIR WAREHOUSE.
