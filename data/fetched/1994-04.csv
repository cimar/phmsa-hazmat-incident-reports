THE DRUMS WERE BANDED (6) EACH TO A WORD PALLET. LATE IN THE EVENING ON 4/12/94 N & M TRANSFER DOCK PERSONNEL HAD REMOVED THE SKIDS OF THESE DRUMS FROM THE ORIGINAL PICK UP TRAILER.  THE DRUMS WERE PLACED ON THE DOCK FOR LOADING AT A LATER TIME.  AT 01:40AM ON WEDNESDAY A DOCKMAN BEGIN LOADING THESE SKIDS ON TO A TRAILER.  AFTER LOADING THE LAST SKID THE DOCKMAN BECAME AWARE OF AN ODOR AND A MIST COMING FROM THE TRAILER.  IN A VERY SHORT WHILE THE VAPORS AND ODOR BECAME QUITE STRONG.  I WAS NOTIFIED OF THE SPILL AT 02:00 A.M.  AFTER CHECKING THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE GUIDE WE AGREED TO NOTIFY CHEM-TREC WHICH WAS LISTED ON THE SHIPPING PAPER AT THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE NUMBER.  CHEMTREC, THEN, IN TURN, NOTIFIED THE SHIPPER.  AT APPROXIMATELY 0300 AM THE SHIPPER CALLED OUT TERMINAL AND ADVISED OUR PERSONNEL TO ENTER THE TRAILER WITH NEGATIVE PRESSURE RESPIRATORS AND LOCATED THE LEAKING CONTAINER.  THEY ADIVSED US THAT AFTER WE LOCATE THE LEAKING CONTAINER WE SHOULD PLACE IT IN A RECOVERY DRUM.  THE N&M FOREMAN COULD NOT LOCATE THE DRUM BECAUSE EACH PALLET CONTAINED DRUMS THAT WERE BANDED TOGETHER, MAKING IT HARD TO DETERMINE WHICH DRUM WAS THE LIGHTEST AS A RESULT OF THE LEAKAGE.  BY 3:30AM THE LEAKING DRUM HAD BEEN LOCATED.  IT WAS FOUND TO HAVE CONTAINED A PIN HOLE LEAK ON THE BOTTOM OUTSIDE RING, WHICH WE BELIEVED WAS CAUSED BY A NAIL PORTRUDING FROM THE PALLET THAT THE SHIPPER HAD LOCATED IT ON. THE SPILLAGE INVOLVED THE COMPLETE LOSS OF 15 GALLONS OF HYDROCHLORIC ACID FROM ONE POLYETHYLENE DRUM.  IT IS MY RECOMMENDATION THAT ALL POLYETHYLENE DRUM HAVE RE-INFORCED BOTTOMS SO THAT ALL PORTRUDING OBJECTS, SUCH AS NAILS, AND FLARED TRAILER WALLS, CANNOT PENETRATE AND CAUSE SPILLAGE.

(""CWM""), 2301 WEST BROADWAY ROAD, PHOENIX, ARIZONA, WHICH IS PERMITTED FOR THE STORAGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARIZONA HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT ACT, AZT050010180. CWM, 1704 WEST FIRST STREET, AZUSA, CALIFORNIA WAS THE IMPORTER OR RECORD. THE WASTE WAS SHIPPED ON A UNIFORM HAZARDOUS WASTE A MANIFEST, DOCUMENT NUMBER 00735. CHEMICAL DISPOSAL WAS THE TRANSPORTER, AZT050010008. AS THE VEHICLE (TRACTOR TRAILER) WAS BEING UNLOADED ONE OF THE FORKS OF THE FACILITY FORKLIFT PUNCTURED THE BOTTOM OF A PLASTIC WOVEN BAG CONTAINING HAZARDOUS WASTE (PROPER SHIPPING NAME: ""RQ"" WASTE ENVIRONMENTALLY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SOLID, N.O.S. (LEAD)). THE WASTE WAS CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS DUE TO THE TOXICITY CHARACTERISTIC FOR LEAD (D008). THE FORK STRUCK THE CONTAINER DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE WOODEN PALLET UPON WHICH THE CONTAINER HAD BEEN PLACED. THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE PALLET, WHICH WAS NOT VISIBLE FROM THE ENTRY POINT OF THE FORKLIFT, HAD COLLAPSED CAUSING THE BOTTOM SECTION OF THE CONTAINER TO PROTRUDE. WHEN THE FORKS WERE PLACED UNDER THE FRONT PORTION OF THE PALLET AND EXTENDED FORWARD THE CONTAINER WAS PUNCTURED. THE FORKLIFT OPERATOR CEASED MOVEMENT OF THE CONTAINER AS SOON AS HE REALIZED THAT ITS INTEGRITY HAD BEEN BREACHED. FACILITY PERSONNEL THEN CONTACTED THEIR SUPERVISOR WHO IN TURN CONTACTED THE EMERGENCY COORDINATOR. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE RELEASE, THE CONTAINER, INCLUDING THE DAMAGED PALLET, WERE PLACED ON PLASTIC SHEETING OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND THE SPILL AREA. APPROXIMATELY TWO (2) POUNDS OF MATERIAL WAS RELEASED ONTO THE FLOORING OF THE VEHICLE AND AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF MATERIAL WAS RELEASED INTO THE FACILITY GRAVELED YARD AT THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE. THE MATERIAL CONTAINED LESS THAN 1% LEAD, THEREFORE A REPORTABLE QUANTITY OF MATERIAL WAS NOT RELEASED. THE MATERIAL RELEASED ONTO THE VEHICLE FLOORING WAS COLLECTED AND PLACED IN A PLASTIC BAG WHICH WAS THEN PLACED IN A STEEL 55-GALLON DRUM. THE VEHICLE FLOORING WAS DECONTAMINATED WITH A DETERGENT SOLUTION. THE SOLUTION WAS ABSORBED WITH PAPER TOWELING. THE FORKS OF THE FORKLIFT WERE DECONTAMINATED IN A SIMILAR MANNER. ALL TOWELING WAS PLACED IN A PLASTIC BAG AND STEEL DRUM ALONG WITH THE RELEASED MATERIAL. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN MOVED TO ALLOW THE FACILITY TO ADDRESS THE MATERIAL RELEASED ON THE GRAVELED AREA. THE VEHICLE AND FORKLIFT DECONTAMINATION WAS COMPLETED BY 09:30. ALL VISIBILY AFFECTED AREAS OF GRAVEL AND SOIL WERE COLLECTED. IN TOTAL APPROXIMATELY TWENTY (20) POUNDS OF GRAVEL AND SOIL WERE EXCAVATED. THE MATERIAL WAS PLACED IN A PLASTIC BAG WHICH WAS THEN PLACED IN A STEEL 55-GALLON DRUM.

ONCE REALIZING THEY MAY HAVE A POTENTIALLY TOXIC INHALATION HAZARD, THE CREW WENT ON OXYGEN. UPON ARRIVAL AT CLEVELAND, THEY TAXIED THE AIRCRAFT TO THE FEDERAL EXPRESS RAMP WHERE CLEVELAND AIRPORT'S CRASH FIRE RESCUE TEAM WAS AWAITING THEIR ARRIVAL.  THIS CREW DEBRIEFED THE CREW AND STARTED REVIEWING THE DANGEROUS GOODS FLT MANIFESTS.  ADDITIONALLY, THEY WERE GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT THE HAZARDS.  SOME 2 1/2 HOURS LATER, THEY BOARD THE AIRCRAFT.  WITHIN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME, THEY HAD DETERMINED THAT THE ODOR WAS NOT COMING FROM THE AIRCRAFT'S DANGEROUS GOODS CONTAINER.  THE CRASH FIRE RESCUE TEAM WAS UNLOADED CHECKING INSIDE EACH OF THE AIRCRAFT'S FREIGHT CONTAINERS. IN POSITION 7, THE PROBLEM PACKAGE WAS LOCATED.  THE PACKAGE WAS BUTYL SULFIDE WHICH IS NOT LISTED BY NAME AS A DANGEROUS GOOD.  ADDITIONALLY THE MSDS WAS EVENTUALLY OBTAINED WHICH DID NOT IDENTIFY ANY HAZARD WHICH WOULD DIRECTLY CLASSIFY THE MATERIAL AS A DANGEROUS GOOD.  THE MSDS DID IDENTIFY THE MATERIAL AS A CONT ""STINCH"" EMITTING MATERIAL.  EASTMAN DID NOT REGULATE THIS MATERIAL AS A DANGEROUS GOOD.  HOWEVER, CHEMICAL PRODUCT LINE WAS PURCHASED 1/1/94 BY FISHER SCIENTIFIC WHICH ARE THE CURRENT OWNERS OF ALL EASTMAN CHEMICAL PRODUCTS.

THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL VALVES WERE SHUT, STOPPING THE FLOW. THE STORM DRAIN WAS CLOSED SO THAT NO PRODUCT WAS RELEASED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE EXTERNAL VALVE ON COMPARTMENT #4 WAS PARTIALLY FROZEN WHEN IT ARRIVED. THE OPERATOR ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THIS VALVE TO GET PRODUCT OUT FOR THE DRUM FILL. WHEN HE COULD NOT GET ANY PRODUCT OUT, HE CLOSED THE EXTERNAL VALVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, CLOSED THE INTERNAL VALVE, AND CONNECTED THE HOSE TO COMPARTMENT #1. AS THE TEMPERATURE INCREASED, THE EXTERNAL VALVE ON COMPARTMENT #4 THAWED AND ALLOWED PRODUCT TO COME OUT OF IT. THE INTERNAL VALVE FAILED COMPLETELY. FACTS LEARNED: 1.  50% CAUSTIC SODA FREEZES AT 54 DEGREES F. 2.  TEMPERATURE WAS A FACTOR.  3. THE INTERNAL VALVE FAILED. 4.  THE EXTERNAL VALVE WAS PARTIALLY FROZEN.  5.  TIME/MANPOWER WAS A FACTOR. 6.  ALTHOUGH THE ATTACHED INVENTORY REPORT INDICATES A MAXIMUM LOSS OF 215 LBS., IT IS BELIEVED THAT 100-150 LBS. WERE SPILLED BASED ON: A. VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE AREA  B. 1:1 DILUTION OF CITRIC ACID  C. DRUM FILLING VARIANCES  7.

THE SECOND DRUM MEASURED 6 TI, CLOSELY CORRESPONDING TO THE STATED 5.5 TI. DR. PARKER IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE SHIPPER, TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND THE PHOENIX, ARIZONA CASFO PURSUANT TO 49 CFR 175.31. HE INSTRUCTED THE PHOENIX RAMP TO HOLD THE SHIPMENT IN A SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER OF THE SHIPMENT, SINCE THE 16TI DRUM COULD NOT BE FURTHER TRANSPORTED UNLESS IT WAS PERFORMED UNDER EXCLUSIVE USE CONDITIONS. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH SPECTRATEK SERVICES, THE RECIPIENT, TO TAKE DELIVERY OF THE DRUMS AT THE FEDERAL EXPRESS PHOENIX RAMP AND EITHER TRANSPORT THE PACKAGE UNDER EXCLUSIVE USE CONDITIONS, REPACKAGE OR OVERPACK THE DRUM. SPECTRATEK SERVICES TOOK DELIVERY OF THE PACKAGE ON SATURDAY, APRIL 30, TRANSFERRED THE SHIELDED INNER CONTAINER IN THE DRUM TO ANOTHER PACKAGE, AND TRANSPORTED IN THEIR OWN VEHICHLE AS A PRIVATE CARRIER. SPECTRATEK SERVICES REPORTED ON MAY 2, 1994 THAT THEY HAD INSPECTED THE PACKAGE AFTER RECEIPT, MEASURED 13 TI ON THE PACKAGE, AND HAD DETERMINED THAT LEAD SHOT, WHICH PROVIDED ADDITIONAL SHIELDING WITHIN THE CAVITY OF THE SHIELDED INNER CONTAINER HAD APPARENTLY SHIFTED DURING TRANSPORT, THEREBY REDUCING THE SHIELDING IN A GIVEN DIRECTION AND INCREASING THE RADIATION LEVEL AND TI. A COPY OF THE DOT 7A TYPE A PACKAGE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE MAINTAINED PURSUANT TO 49 CFR 173415(A) HAD BEEN INITIALLY REQUESTED FROM THE SHIPPER AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SUPPLIED BY THE RECIPIENT, SPECTRATEK SERVICES, SINCE IT WAS THEIR PACKAGE.
