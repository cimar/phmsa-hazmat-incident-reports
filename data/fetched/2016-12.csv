The WLE yardmaster notified myself, John Vergis Environmental Officer for WLE.  I came to the yard to investigate and found vapors coming from the vacuum relief device. I removed seal #1383723 from the lid of the housing and I took the tamper proof cap off the device and tried to manually operate the valve in order to get it to re-seat but it would not.  I could not get it to stop leaking.  I made a report to Chemtrec who in turn contacted the shipper, Markwest.  They dispatched their Emergency Responder, SunPro.  They came out and with my help, took the faulty valve off the car.  When we took the valve off and looked at the rubber seal on the valve. I noticed that the rubber seal was swollen as if the rubber material was not compatible with the material in the car.  The rubber seal was not damaged, it was just swollen causing it to not seal properly.  Sunpro installed a new vacuum relief device and then bubble tested the car with Nitrogen.  The car passed a 30 pound test and then car was then released for service.  New seal # 1380517 was applied to the housing of the car.","When devices are applied to the car, compatibility of gaskets needs to be checked.

Emergency Stop Devices (ESD's) were activated shutting down the delivery of Compressed Natural Gas to the trailers. The Eliot Fire Department was summoned per protocol. Xpress Natural Gas Engineer and Safety Director arrived on scene. After investigation of the trailer, it was discovered that compressed natural gas had somehow seeped between the inner composite cylinder and the liner. Since the gas was under pressure, the ""popping"" noises were being made as the trapped gas evacuated through the liner, dissipating into the atmosphere. The cylinder was isolated and vented slowly to fully empty.

There were no casualties and no environmental impact requiring remediation.  Upon completion of the inspection and repair, the car was released for movement to destination for unloading.  Quantity of release of 1 cubic foot is an estimate based on reports from response personnel.",All cars must have a complete inspection of gaskets and closures prior to departure.

When they investigated, they noticed a drip coming from the bottom outlet valve.  They called the WEL Brewster Dispatcher who in turn called myself, John Vergis, WLE Environmental Officer.  I called Specialized Professional Services out of Washington, PA to go look at the car.  When they arrived, they saw that the gasket between the internal ball valve portion of the bottom outlet valve, and the valve nozzle was leaking. This is a bolted, flanged connection.  They tried to tighten the mounting bolts but they were already tight.  The gasket was defective.  They installed a Haz hammock under the car to contain any drips until further action was taken. I contacted Chemtrec who in turn put the shipper, Markwest in touch with me.  We determined that the car needed to be transloaded and that the gasket would need to be replaced.  The car was transloaded on 1-3-2017.  Repairs were completed on the car on 1-17-2017 and the car was released for transportation.

AT 4:30 P.M. NOT REALIZING THE MISTAKEN ADDRESS, DRIVER DID FIND BASEMENT TANK FILL PIPE AND VENT PIPE LOCATED ON OUTSIDE FOUNDATION WALL OF HOUSE.

LOCATION AND INITIATED OFF-LOADING OF THE NO. 2 DYED DIESEL INTO THE FILL PIPE AND INITIATED THE OFF-LOADING PROCESS INTO THE BASEMENT FUEL OIL TANK. DRIVER STATED IT WAS A COLD AND WINDY DAY, BUT THAT HE COULD FEEL AIR VENTING FROM THE VENT PIPE AND FELT DELIVERY WAS PROCEEDING PROPERLY. WHEN THE PRE-SET AMOUNT OF 540 GALLONS WAS DISPENSED THE PUMPING UNIT ON TRUCK SHUT DOWN AND AT THAT TIME DRIVER BECAME CONCERNED THAT HE MAY HAD A TANK OVERFILL AS THE PRE-SET AMOUNT OF 540 GALLONS WAS SO CLOSE TO THE NOTED 550 GALLON CAPACITY OF TANK(S) TO BE DELIVERED INTO. DRIVER THEN LAID HIS HOSE/NOZZLE ON GROUND AND ATTEMPTED TO LOOK INTO RESIDENCE BASEMENT WINDOWS TO SEE IF HE COULD OBSERVE ANYTHING THAT COULD LEND TOWARD A TANK OVERFILL OR ALIKE. DRIVER KNOCKED ON RESIDENCE DOORS AND WAS UNABLE TO GET RESPONSE FROM RESIDENTS. DRIVER CALLED INTO HIS CIRCLEVILLE. OH DISPATCH OFFICE AND SPOKE WITH LYKINS FACILITY MANAGER AND VOICED HIS CONCERNS. MANAGER RESPONDED TO SCENE AND WITH DRIVER AGAIN KNOCKED ON DOORS OF RESIDENCE WITH NO RESPONSE. MANAGER GOT ON-LINE VIA HIS SMART PHONE AND BY ADDRESS OF 4640 CRUMLEY ROAD WAS ABLE TO LOOK UP A PHONE NUMBER FOR RESIDENT AND THEN CALLED THE RESIDENT, WHO THEN DID ANSWER THE PHONE CALL AND UPON REQUEST CAME TO DOOR. MANAGER ASKED RESIDENT TO CHECK THEIR BASEMENT MAKE SURE IF THEIR BASEMENT TANK MAY HAVE BEEN OVERFILLED AND IF ANY FUEL HAD BEEN SPILLED. RESIDENT THEN ADVISED THERE WAS NO LONGER A TANK CONNECTED TO THE FILL PIPE, THAT WAS STILL IN-PLACE ON THE BACK WALL OF HOUSE, AS HE, THE RESIDENT, HAD PERSONALLY REMOVED THE FUEL TANK FROM BASEMENT A COUPLE OF YEARS PRIOR BUT HAD LEFT THE FILL AND VENT PIPES IN PLACE AND NOT DISABLE. RESIDENT CHECKED BASEMENT AND OBSERVED FUEL ON THE FLOOR AREA OF THE BASEMENT. RESIDENT ALLOWED OUR MANAGER AND DRIVER TO ENTER AND OBSERVE THE BASEMENT AREA AND IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT FUEL OIL WAS IN BASEMENT AREA OF HOUSE. MANAGER THEN PLACED CALL INTO LYKINS CORPORATE OFFICE AND ADVISED SAFETY DEPARTMENT OF THE SPILL INCIDENT. LYKINS SAFETY PERSONNEL THEN ADVISED MANAGER TO PLACE CALL TO 911 AND REPORT INCIDENT TO LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEN PLACED CALL TO OHEPA (SPILL INCIDENT REPORT ID 3 1612-23-2346//0); PLACED CALL AND SECURED SUPERIOR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES (SES) FOR INITIAL RESPONSE AND ALSO COORDINATED WITH LYKINS INSURANCE CARRIER TO SECURE SERVICES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT WITH SHIELD ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, INC.
