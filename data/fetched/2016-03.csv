Tank was re-inspected at or around 8:15am and still found to be leaking and repair was not possible after a bolt was found to be missing connecting the main rear port to the tanks rear underside. Tank owner stated that a repair technician was enroute. The repair technician arrived and stated the repair was beyond his scope. Tank owner and shipper then stated another tank and repair technician was enroute to repair the leak and transfer the product.

The car was isolated and the Shipper, Chemtrade Logistics was notified via CHEMTREC, report 2016-03-10-00180.  A CSX Emergency Response contractor, Sunpro - Schererville, IN branch office, was dispatched to the scene.  Upon inspection it was determined the sulfuric acid appeared to be leaking from the liquid line cap and that the railcar was pressurized to 9 psi.  SUNPRO depressurized the railcar and removed the liquid line cap.  The project manager noted that no threading tape or leak dope was present on the liquid line.  The response team affixed threading tape onto the liquid line opening and reinstalled the cap.  SUNPRO utilized fresh water and absorbent pads to neutralize and recover the spilled sulfuric acid from the exterior of the railcar.

The release during the loading process occurred due to an open cleanout valve on the top of the product filter housing.     Carrier arrived and operations began the loading process at 15:33. At approximately 15:45, GP operations became aware that the formaldehyde solution was flowing from the open cleanout on the filer housing. The loading process was aborted, and the area cleaned of spilled material, which was diluted and reclaimed for further use in the production process.     Once the incident had been resolved, the loading process with the carrier was completed without further incident. Due to the spill exceeding the RQ, notifications were made to NRC, SERC and LEPC. This follow-up report was prompted due to the process equipment failure being a part of an active cargo tank loading operation. Other than the carrier delay, there was no impact to the carrier or the package with this incident.","The prompt implementation of the facility spill response procedures helped minimize the extent of the release. To prevent recurrence of a similar release, the Columbus plant is planning to replace the secondary valve on the filter assembly with a spring loaded valve which requires it to be physically held open to safely release pressure prior to opening and accessing the filters for cleaning.

The release occurred during the loading of a copper filter cake rolloff (F006 Hazardous Waste). The container had been removed from the building to load for transport. When lifted to a 45 degree angle to load onto the truck, liquid from inside the rolloff leaked out through the door. Enpro personnel (the Carrier) responded immediately by blocking off the nearby sewer drain and lowering the rolloff; minimizing the volume that reached the environment.  An estimated 200-300ml reached a stormwater catch basin (which does not discharge offsite). Enpro's quick action prevented the release from exceeding the CERCLA RQ.    The emergency response team arrived at the scene to clean up the spill using absorbent pads and granular absorbent material.  The catch basin was also pumped out into a container using a submersible pump.  The content of the container was inspected and remaining liquid was removed from the rolloff and placed into drums.  Waste generated from the cleanup was disposed of as hazardous waste.",GLOBAL FOUNDRIES has updated their procedures for this task to implement better checks for the presence of free liquid in the roll off prior to offering the material for shipment in commerce.  These checks will be performed throughout the process of filling the container and a final check immediately prior to removal of the container from the building for loading.

Upon investigating, it was determined to contain three articles containing poly-chlorinated biphenyl contaminated oil. The articles were not secure within the IBC and tipped over while in transit. This caused oil to be released from the articles and approximately one pint was release onto the steel lined truck floor. The spilled oil was absorbed with clay absorbent which was then added to the IBC. In addition, the surface area of the spill was decontaminated with diesel fuel and swipe tests were analyzed to determine the area had no residual PCB contamination.","In order to prevent a reoccurance of this event, the field personnel received additional training on appropriate packaging for articles containing polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated oil.

THE RESPONDERS THEN CHECKED THE ADJACENT DOWNSTREAM STORM WATER BASIN, ON THE EXTERIOR OF THE DOCK, AND IT HAD A PH OF 7.  IT DID NOT APPEAR THAT ANY MATERIAL HAD BEEN RELEASED TO THE STORM SEWER.    THE RESPONDERS CALLED IN A VACUUM TRUCK TO EMPTY THE DOWNSTREAM BASIN, THE DOCK BASIN AND TO REMOVE THE LIQUID IN THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER.    UPON DONNING PPE AND ENTRY INTO THE TRAILER, THE RESPONDERS NOTED THAT LIQUID HAD ACCUMULATED IN THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER.   THEY WORKED AT SCRAPING UP SOLID PRECIPITATE FROM THE TRAILER FLOOR.

ALL SEALS WERE STILL INTACT THAT WERE INSTALLED PRIOR TO THE CONTAINER LEAVING ORIGIN (DOUGLAS, WY). IT APPEARED THE SHIFT IN THE LOAD DURING TRANSIT CAUSED ENOUGH PRESSURE ON THE LID SEALS TO ALLOW LEAKAGE THROUGH THE SEALS. AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WAS NOTED THAT THE CONTAINER WAS FILLED ABOVE RECOMMENDED LEVELS AND THE MATERIAL WAS MORE LIQUID THAN THE PACKAGE WAS DESIGNED FOR.     AT APPROXIMATELY 094 HOURS THE RSO ALLOWED THE LOAD ONTO THE PROPERTY. THE STATE WAS AWARE OF THE LOADING COMING ONTO PROPERTY. THE MAIN REASON FOR THE LOAD COMING ONTO THE PROPERTY WAS THAT RAIN WAS STARTING TO FALL AND WASHING SOME OF THE MATERIAL OFF OF THE CONTAINER AND ONTO THE GROUND. IN ORDER TO PREVENT A LARGER CLEANUP, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO GET INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA.     THE AREA ON US HIGHWAY 191 AND THE EFRI ENTRANCE WAY, WAS WASHED AND MY CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS DUG UP AND TAKEN INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA, AND THEN OUT OF CELL 3.

ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT, UPON APPROACH TO THE SITE OF THE ACCIDENT, THE DRIVER LEFT THE ROADWAY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD. IT APPEARS THAT THE DRIVER WAS ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THE TRUCK ON THE ROAD, BUT AFTER COMING BACK ON THE ROAD THE TRAILER OVERTURNED, CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE TANKER THAT RESULTED IN A SPILL AND SUBSEQUENT FIRE. THE TRUCK AND TRAILER BECAME IMMEDIATELY ENGULFED IN FLAMES. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINED EXACTLY WHERE THE FUEL CAME OUT OF, AS THE CARGO TANK WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED IN THE FIRE. THE BEST WE CAN DETERMINE, THE TANK OVERTURNED ROLLING TO THE RIGHT AND GOUGES OR TEARS IN THE SIDE OF THE TANK LED TO THE LEAKAGE. WE WERE UNAWARE THAT THE TRUCK BELONGED TO APC UNTIL SC STEP CONTACTED OUT OFFICE. FIRE CREWS RESPONDED OUT OF BELTON, ANDERSON COUNTY, AND DONALDSON CENTER. THE FIRE WAS PUT OUT BY USE OF FOAM. IT IS UNKNOWN HOW LING GASOLINE SPILLED OUT OF THE TANKER, HOWEVER CLEANUP EFFORTS REVEALED THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT DID ACTUALLY SPILL THAT WAS UNBURNED. DUE TO THE LANDSCAPING AND CONTOUR, ALL OF THE SPILL WAS CONTAINED IN AN AREA OF APPROX. 5,000 FT. APC HIRED A CLEANUP CONTRACTOR WHO IMMEDIATELY (AFTER THE FIRE WAS OUT ) VACUUMED UP THE STANDING PRODUCT/WATER THAT WAS VISIBLE ON THE GROUND. THE CLEANUP CREW EXCAVATED THE ENTIRE AREA OF THE RELEASE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS, WITH THE EXCAVATION RANGING FROM 1 TO 16 FEET IN DEPTH. THE EXCAVATION WAS BACK-FILLED WITH FRESH FILL DIRT AND TOPSOIL, AND WAS SEEDED AND STRAWED TO COMPLETE THE EXCAVATION. ONGOING EFFORTS WILL INCLUDE A SINGLE  MONITORING WELL TO DETERMINE IF ANY EFFECT ON GROUNDWATER. EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT THE EAST MAJORITY OF THE CONTAMINATED DIRT WAS REMOVED, AND THE MONITORING PROCESS WILL BE SHORT.","AFTER REVIEW BY SC HIGHWAY PATROL, SC START TRANSPORT POLICE AND FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DRIVER SIMPLY RAN OUT OF THE ROADWAY AND FAILED TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.
