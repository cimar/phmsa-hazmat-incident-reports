THE RAILCAR CONTENTS (APPROXIMATELY 25,00O# PHENOL) WAS THEN PUMPED TO A RECYCLE TANK.  DURING THIS TIME, AN ESTIMATED 60 GALLONS OF PHENOL ESCAPED FROM THE LEAK POINT ONTO A FULLY CONTAINED CONCRETE AREA.

THE RAILCAR BOTTOMS VALVE WAS LATER INSPECTED AND FOUND TO HAVE A DAMAGED GASKET AT THE SEAL FOR THE BOTTOM SUPPORT RING OF THE VALVE MECHANISM.  THIS WAS REPLACED AND THE RAILCAR PRESSURE TESTED PRIOR TO ANY FURTHER LOADING.  AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT, KCI HAS ADDED A PRESSURE TEST PROCEDURE TO ITS PRODUCT BENZENE, PHENOL, AND PLASTICIZER RAILCAR LOADING PROCEDURES.

THE SAFETY EQUIPMENT WHICH WE USED WORKED, PREVENTING ANY SPILL INTO THE AIR.  AFTER THE TANK HAD BEEN RIGHTED, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TANK WAS BASICALLY UNDAMAGED. IN ORDER TO GET THE TANK BACK INTO TOWN FOR FURTHER CHECK UP, WE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE TO PLOW APPLY WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE TANK.  THIS WAS DOME WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENTS.  AFTER CLOSE EXAMINATION I DETERMINED THAT I WOULD REPLACE THE SAFETY POP OFF VALVE AND BOTH FILL VALVES.  THE REASON FOR THIS WAS BECAUSE I DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT THE ROLL BAR LOOKED LIKE.  I DECIDED AT THAT TIME TO REPLACE THOSE ITEMS. NEXT I MOVED THE AD TANK TO THE LOADING AREA AND HOOKED THE AD TANK UP TO THE PUMP AND PUMPED OFF ALL THE REMAINING LIQUID INTO THREE TANKS.  JUST TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE THAT THERE WAS NO LIQUID LEFT IN THE TANK.  UPON COMPLETION OF THIS I CRACKED OPEN THE SMALL BLEEDER VALVE ON TOP OF THE TANK.  I ADJUSTED THIS VALVE TO THE POINT THAT I COULD COMPLETELY WALK AROUND AND WORK ON THE TANK WITHOUT MY NH3 MASK FOR PROTECTION.  EVIDENTLY MY PERSONAL TOLERANCE FOR THE SMELL OF ANHYDROUS IS A LOT GREATER THAT MOST PEOPLE.  I FEEL BADLY FOR WHAT HAS TAKEN PLACE SO FAR, BUT I CANT STRESS ANY MORE STRONGER THAT I BELIEVED WITH ALL MY HEART AND SOUL THAT I DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT.  I JUST PLAIN UNDERESTIMATED OTHER PEOPLES TOLERANCE FOR NH3.  THE ONLY THING BEING RELEASED WAS TANK PRESSURE AND NOTHING BEYOND THAT.

AS THE CONTAINER WAS PLACARDED FLAMMABLE, IT WAS MOVED TO A TRAILER STORAGE LOT #16 AND ISOLATED PENDING INSPECTION. AS MANAGER COOPER WAS IN LAS VEGAS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL TRANLOADING SERVICES (ETSI), THE RAILROADS HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CONTRACTOR, TO INSPECT THE CONTAINER. INSPECTION DEVELOPED THE LEAKING COMMODITY TO BE THE LISTED PETROLEUM DISTILLATE. AFTER OBTAINING A MSDS FROM THE SHIPPER, MONSANTO, THE REAR DOOR SEAL, MONSANTO 77952, WAS REMOVED TO INSPECT THE INTERIOR LADING . UPON OPENING THE REAR DOORS, OBSERVED 3 EACH 2X6 HORIZONTAL BULL BOARDS ACROSS THE BACK OF THE LADING, POSITIONED IN THE SIDEWALL SLOTTED DOOR POST. THESE WERE EVENLY SPACED WITH THE UTILIZATION OF SEVERAL 3 FOOT VERTICAL PIECES NAILED TO EACH CROSS MEMBER. DIRECTLY BEHIND THE LUMBER WAS A SINGLE PIECE OF 4X8 FOOT PLYWOOD, PLACED ON END, AND ONLY PROTECTING THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LADING. THERE WERE 2 EACH LARGE D.I.D. INFLATABLE BAGS ON END BETWEEN THE LUMBER/PLYWOOD AND SEVERAL LARGE SECTIONS OF 6 INCH CORRUGATED HONEYCOMB FILLER MATERIAL, WHICH SEPARATED THE LADING OF DRUMS. THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDED PRACTIVE FOR DOUBLE STACKED LADING OF DRUMS, AND IS NOT AN APPROVED METHOD PER THE BUREAU OF EXPLOSIVES, PAMPHLET 6C FOR THE SECUREMENT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FOR TRANSPORTATION. ** DUE TO THE CONFIGURATION OF THE DOUBLE STACKED DRUMS, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WITHOUT OFF LOADING THE ENTIRE CONTENTS. ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE WITH APL, THE RAILROADS SHIPPER OF RECORD, TO AUTHORIZE THE TRANSLOAD OPERATION AND PROVIDE A BACK UP CONTAINER. DUE TO THE BASE CONSTITUENT OF THE PRODUCT BEING XYLENE, IT WAS DECIDED TO PLACED THE LADING INTO ANOTHER CONTAINER FOR MOVEMENT TO THE CONSIGNEE, AND THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER WOULD FOR MOVEMENT TO THE CONSIGNEE, AND THE ORGINAL CONTAINER WOULD BE MOVED TO APL'S M&R GROUP FOR INSPECTION AND DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THE FLOOR WOULD REQUIRE REMOVAL OR JUST CLEANING OF THE RESIDUE IMBEDDED IN THE WOOD FLOORING. ** APL PROVIDED EMPTY CONTAINER APLS 286343, WHICH WAS GROUNDED ADJACENT TO THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER, AS THERE IS NO LOADING DOCK TO WORK FROM WITHIN THE INTERMODAL FACILITY. ** THE OPERATION REMOVED THE DRUMS, WHICH WERE INSPECTED PRIOR TO LOADING INTO THE SECONDARY CONTAINER.
