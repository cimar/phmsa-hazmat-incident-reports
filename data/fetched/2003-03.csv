CSXT HAD DELIVERED THE RAIL CARS TO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES' CARE AND CONTROL SEVEN (7) DAYS EARLIER.  THE TANK CARS WERE NO LONGER IN TRANSPORT.  PROVIDENCE ENVIRONMENTAL TENDERED THE WAYBILL TO CSXT ON FEBRUARY 10, 2003.  THE BILLING INFORMATION, FROM PROVIDENCE, INDICATED THAT THE TANK CARS: GATX91466, GATX91503, GATX91526, GATX91532, GATX98031, GATX98032 AND GATX98033 WERE OFFERED FOR TRANSPORTATION AS AN EMPTY NON HAZARDOUS RAIL CAR.  THE CARS WERE DELIVERED BY CSXT TO PROVIDENCE ON FEBRUARY 28, 2003, ONTO TRACK OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY PROVIDENCE.  IN RESPONSE TO CHIEF WALLACE'S INQUIRY, CSXT IMMEDIATELY INVESTIGATED THE CAR CONTENTS, SHIPPER AND PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO ASSIST THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. ACCORDING TO CHIEF WALLACE,  THE RAIL CARS WERE ""SMOKING FROM THE TOP"" BUT HAD NO PLACARDS OR MARKINGS AND TAPE HAD BEEN APPLIED OVER THE AREA WHERE THE PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION NAME WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN STENCILED.  AS SOON AS CSXT DETERMINED THE MOVEMENT HISTORY AND CONTENTS OF THE CAR, THAT INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED TO CHIEF WALLACE.  CSXT UTILIZED CHEMTREC TO ASSIST IN MAKING CONTACT WITH THE SHIPPER, PROVIDENCE ENVIRONMENTAL OF COLUMBIA, SC.  CHIEF WALLACE DECIDED AS A PRECAUTION TO EVACUATE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN (11) NEARBY RESIDENTS UNTIL THE RELEASE WAS SECURED. NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED BY ANY OF THE RESIDENTS.  CSXT INFORMED PROVIDENCE OF THE COMMUNITIES' CONCERNS, THE POTENTIAL RISK TO THE COMMUNITY AND INSISTED THAT THEY RETURN TO THE SITE PROMPTLY TO PROPERLY SECURE THE RAIL CARS.  AFTER THE PERSISTENT URGING OF CSXT,  PROVIDENCE DISPATCHED REPRESENTATIVES TO THE LOCATION AND SECURED THE OPENINGS USING PLASTIC AND TAPE.  UPON FURTHER CAR RECORD MOVEMENT TRACING HISTORY OF OUR DATABASE, CSXT WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE CARS WERE PREVIOUSLY BILLED TO RESCAR IN RAINS, SC, AS RESIDUE TITANIUM TETRACHLORIDE.  ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT, MARCH 7, 2003, PROVIDENCE HAD APPARENTLY INITIATED A ""CLEAN AND PURGE"" OPERATION ON THESE RAIL CARS.  THEY USED A CRANE TO REMOVE THE PRESSURE PLATES ALONG WITH THE VALVE ASSEMBLIES ON EACH OF THEE CARS. ACCORDING TO PROVIDENCE STATEMENTS, THE CRANE WAS RENTED AND IN AN EFFORT TO SAVE MONEY, THE DECISION WAS MADE BY PROVIDENCE TO REMOVE ALL OF THE PRESSURE PLATES/VALVE ASSEMBLIES AT THE SAME TIME.

TIM THEN STARTED OFF LOADING THE TRUCK AND SENT THE BELLY HAZ CONTAINER DOWN THE BELT TO THE BELLY WORKERS ROBERT VORHOLY AND RICHARD COUKART. THEY PROCEEDED TO PULL SEVERAL CONTAINERS AROUND THE A/C TO LOAD. ONE OF THESE CONTAINERS WAS THE BELLY HAZ WHICH CONTAINED THE LEAKING SHIPMENT. RICH OPENED THE CONTAINER AND BEGAN PLACING FREIGHT AT THE OPENING OF BELLY 3/4 TO BE STACKED BY ROBERT WHO WAS INSIDE LOADING THE FREIGHT. THEY PLACED APPROXIMATELY 10 PIECES OF ASSORTED HAZ INTO THE A/C BELLY ALL CLASS 9 OR CLASS 6 PIECES. WHEN RICH NOTICED THAT A RING OF LIQUID FORMED AROUND THE ONE BOX SITTING ON THE BELLY OPENING. RICH PULLED THE PIECE BACK OUT OF THE BELLY OPENING SO THAT ROBERT COULD GET OUT OF THE A/C. ROBERT STEPPED INTO THE LIQUID WHEN EXITING THE BELLY, AND RICHARD PLACED THE BOX ON THE RAMP. THEY WENT FOR THE RAMP LEAD, JEFF GALLAGHER,TO REPORT THE INCIDENT. RICHARD TOLD JEFF ABOUT THE LEAKING SHIPMENT AND ROBERT SECURED THE AREA. ROBERT NOTIFIED THE MECHANIC, FLIGHT CREW, AND OTHER RAMP WORKERS. JEFF ARRIVED AND CHECKED THE AIRBILL, WHAT TYPE OF HAZ, AND GRABBED THE SHIPPERS DECLARATIONS FOR THE BELLY HAZ CONTAINER. JEFF CONTACTED ME AT THE ABH HUB FOR ADVICE. I TREVOR STEIGERWALT-ABH RAMP SUPERVISOR, TOLD JEFF TO CONTACT THE HAZ HOTLINE IMMEDIATELY AND FOLLOW THE ERCC FLIP CHART OF HAZ SPILLS UNTIL I CAN MAKE IT TO THE RAMP. I THEN INFORMED MY AREA MANAGER, DAVE KILLION OF THE SITUATION AT THE RAMP AND DEPARTED THE ABH HUB AT 0335. UPON ARRIVING AT THE RAMP AT 0355, JEFF HAD ALREADY CONTACTED ILN FLIGHT CONTROL, AND WAS BACK ON THE PHONE WITH THE HAZ HOTLINE. I QUICKLY STARTED INTERVIEWING THE RAMP WORKERS TO GET THEIR VERSIONS OF THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE SPILL. I SPENT MORE TIME WITH RICHARD COUKART, ROBERT VORHOLY, AND TIM TOMEK ALL WHO WERE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH FINDING THE HAZ SPILL. I WANTED TO KNOW IF THEY WERE FEELING ANY EFFECTS OR SYMPTOMS FROM THE CONTACT WITH THE SPILL. AT 0415, I INSPECTED THE SPILL AREA TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING WAS SAFE AND SECURE. I THEN DETERMINED THAT ONLY TRACE AMOUNTS OF THE 6.1 LIQUID ACTUALLY CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE INSIDE OF BELLY 4. RICH SET THE HAZ IN THE DOOR OPENING AND IMMEDIATELY SAW SOME OF THE LIQUID DRIPPING OUT OF THE CORNER OF THE BOX. HE NOTED IT AS A FAUCET DRIPPING, HOWEVER, THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX WAS ALREADY SOAKED FROM THE HAZ LEAKING ITS CONTENTS ONTO THE CONTAINER. THE CONTAINER ITSELF SEEMED TO BE WELL LOADED ORIENTATION ARROWS UP AND PROPERLY BLOCKED/BRACED. AT 0435, I CONTACTED ILN HAZ HOTLINE TO BRING THEM UP TO SPEED REGARDING THE A/C AND ALSO FIND OUT AN ETA ON THE SPILL RESPONSE TEAM DONNIE OSBORNE FROM THE HOTLINE INFORMED ME 1 HOUR AND THE HMHTTC WAS THE TEAM RESPONDING.

AT THE ROYSTER-CLARK FACILITY LOCATED ON COMMERCE STREET IN FRANKLIN, KENTUCKY.  APPROXIMATELY 4,000 POUNDS OF ANHYDROUS AMMONIA WERE RELEASED TO THE ATMOSPHERE FROM A 1,000-GALLON NURSE TANK DURING A HOSE CHANGING PROCEDURE.  AS THE EMPLOYEE WAS PREPARING TO DEPRESSURIZE THE WITHDRAWAL HOSE, HE WAS INTERRUPTED AND DISTRACTED BY OTHER EMPLOYEES AND A CUSTOMER.  AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH THE EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMER, THE EMPLOYEE TURNED BACK TO THE NURSE TANK AND PROCEEDED TO REMOVE THE HOSE.  AFTER TALKING WITH THE OTHER EMPLOYEES AND THE CUSTOMER, HE FORGOT TO BLEED THE PRESSURE FROM THE HOSE.  HE DID NOT NOTICE THE OPEN WITHDRAWAL VALVE AND SAWED INTO THE HOSE CAUSING THE CONTENTS OF THE NURSE TANK TO RELEASE.  THE EMPLOYEE IMMEDIATELY TRIED TO CLOSE THE WITHDRAWAL VALVE BUT FOUND THE VALVE HAD BEEN DAMAGED AND THE VALVE STEM WAS BENT.  THE BENT STEM PREVENTED THE VALVE FROM BEING CLOSED. A CALL WAS PLACED TO THE 911 DISPATCH AND THE FRANKLIN FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED AND SET UP A WATER FOG AND ATTEMPTED TO CLOSE THE VALVE.  ALL ATTEMPTS TO CLOSE THE VALVE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AND THE CONTENTS OF THE TANK WERE ALLOWED TO DISSIPATE TO THE ATMOSPHERE. FIVE FACTORIES LOCATED IN THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BEHIND THE ROYSTER-CLARK FACILITY WERE EVACUATED FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS.  THE FACTORIES EVACUATED WERE BONDED FIBERS INC., TYCO ELECTRONICS CORPORATION, PRINTERS INC., PETROFERM CONTRACT SERVICES INC., AND SILGAN PLASTICS CORPORATION. THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE LOCAL 911 DISPATCH AT APPROXIMATELY 11:35 A.M.  CST.  THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS CONTACTED AT APPROXIMATELY 12:05 P.M.  CST AND THE STATE EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER AT APPROXIMATELY 12:15 P.M.  CST. CLEANUP AND REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES: ABOUT 4,000 GALLONS OF WATER WERE SPRAYED AT THE VAPOR CLOUD.  MOST OF THE WATER REMAINED ON THE SURFACE OF THE ROYSTER-CLARK LOT.  A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER RAN OFF SITE DOWN A SMALL DITCH.  AT THE REQUEST OF THE KENTUCKY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, ABOUT 30 GALLONS OF WATER WERE REMOVED FROM A SMALL DEPRESSION AT THE END OF A CULVERT.  THE WATER WAS PLACED IN DRUMS AND STORED IN CONTAINMENT AT THE ROYSTER-CLARK FACILITY.  THE WATER WILL BE LAND APPLIED.  IN AN EFFORT TO RECOVER SOME OF THE WATER FROM THE COMPANY LOT, A SUMP PIT DITCH WAS OPENED AT THE BASE OF THE HILL BELOW THE AREA WHERE THE WATER FOG WAS USED. THE PIT HAS BEEN MONITORED AND NO WATER HAS ACCUMULATED.  THE PIT IS NOW READY TO BE CLOSED. ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT: EMPLOYEE FAILED TO FOLLOW COMPANY PROCEDURES AND PERFORMED A LINE BREAKING PROCEDURE WITHOUT FIRST REMOVING PRESSURE FROM THE LINE. CONTRIBUTING CAUSES: A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE TO THE INCIDENT WAS THE DISTRACTION CAUSED WHEN THE EMPLOYEE STOPPED TO TALK WITH THE OTHER EMPLOYEES AND THE CUSTOMER.

THE SHIPMENT HAD BEEN PACKAGED BY THE SHIPPER USING APPROXIMATELY FIVE LBS OF DRY ICE AS A COOLING MEDIUM.  THE SPECIMEN VIALS CONTAINED BRAIN MATTER FROM BIRDS THAT WERE BELIEVED TO BE INFECTED WITH THE WEST NILE VIRUS.  THE VIALS WERE FURTHER OVERPACKED INTO A PLASTIC BOX WHICH WAS PLACED INTO A STYOFOAM SHIELD.  THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY WAS THEN PLACED INTO AN OUTER FIBERBOARD BOX.  APPARENTLY THE SHIPPER PLACED THE DRY ICE INTO THE PLASTIC BOX AND SEALED IT.  THE BOX WAS NOT MANUFACTURED TO VENT INTERNAL GASES SO CONSEQUENTLY THE DRY ICE SUBLIMATED TO THE POINT WHERE THE PRESSURE BUILT UP IN THE PLASTIC BOX TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT CAUSED THE BOX TO RUPTURE WHICH IN TURN CAUSED THE TWO ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF PACKING TO FAIL AND TO ALLOW THE RELEASE OF THE SPECIMEN MATERIAL.  THERE WERE NO EXPOSURES OR INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT.
