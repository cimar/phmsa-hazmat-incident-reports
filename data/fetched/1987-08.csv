THE LABEL WAS DISCOVERED ON THE INNER CONTAINER BY ONE OF EMERY'S REPACKAGING PERSONNEL. HE WAS IN T HE PROCESS OF RECOUPING THE OUTER FIBERBOARD BOX WHEN HE DISCOVERED THE INN ER METAL PAIL HAD A SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTIBLE LABEL ATTACHED. THIS IS WHEN THE AREA WAS EVACUATED AND THE APPROPRIATE PERSONNEL WAS NOTIFIED OF A POSS IBLE HAZ-MAT SSPILL. APPEARS THE REASON FOR THE SPILL WAS THE RESULT OF A L OOSE FITTING CLOSURE ON THE INNER RECEPTACLES. MICHAEL A. MASSIE ON 8-13-87 WE HAD A RECOUP IN MODULE D. WE ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 0340.
