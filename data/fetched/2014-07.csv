This tank was a non dot HDPE storage tank. This tank is not used for transportation purposes according to the consignee. It is strictly a storage tank that hypochlorite is stored in before being used in accordance with MSDS recommended usage for pool water treatment. The driver connected delivery hose and started the offloading process. After off loading roughly 200 gallons into the consignee storage tank, spillage became visible. The driver immediately closed off all valves on the CTMV. After climbing around the consignee's storage tank he found the tank adapter that is used for offloading from the storage tank into the consignees smaller containers was leaking profusely. Within minutes the contents of the tank leaked onto the consignee's private property. The driver secured the scene and notified the customer and Poolsure management team of the spill. Shortly after the customer bermed the area and developed a plan for clean. After Poolsure management arrived on scene and gathered data the driver was released from the scene by Poolsure management team. The consignee agreed to privately handle the remediation in accordance with MSDS recommendations.",Poolsure will no longer supply this customer with hypochlorite solution unless a containment is used even though the containment for this storage amount is not required by law.

I was told that the car was leaking from the manyway as it was sitting still. I called Chemtrec at 0845 to make the initial spill notification.  MarkWest in Denver, CO contacted me at 0900 hrs. to discuss.  Rick Kline from the MarkWest plant that loaded the car called me at 0915 to see what was going on.  I told him of the situation and he said he was going to contact his Emergency Response Contractor to come look at the situation.  I arrived on scene at 1010 hrs.  When I approached the car I noticed a 4 foot wide stream of product running down the car onto the ground.  The liquid was coming from the ""Bread Box"".  I climbed the car to investigate and find that the Sample line valve inside the Bread Box Dome was in the fully open position and that the valve plug was not installed.  I shut the valve, reinstalled the plug and released the car back into service at approximately 1035 hours.  According to the MarkWest facility, when the car was loaded, it had 13 inches of outage. I checked the car after it was secured, and the guage read 17 inches of outage.  The Emergency Response Contractor arrived at the same time as I did and started to dig a ditch on either side of the rail and install absorbent boom in the ditch to catch any product that may migrate out after a rain event.  Ohio EPA was also notified and a report number was issued.  The ditches and absorbent boom that was installed will be monitored for a minimum of three weeks or until it is determined that no more product, if any, will seep from the road bed.",A more thorough securment procedure needs to be followed before a car is released for shipment.,Yes,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,8000,Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway,US,

The responder reported that the BOV's operating handle's retaining pin had broken with its remnants hanging from the pin retention chain. The unpinned BOV operating handle moved downward into a slightly open position. This opened the BOV and the accumulating commodity seeped out at the threaded connection of the bottom outlet valve's closure cap (BOC). The responder closed the BOV by moving the BOV's operating handle to the closed position and installed a bolt with nut fastener to hold the BOV operating handle upward in the closed position.

The employee tried to make the left hand turn at an excessive speed. The speed caused enough side force on the totes to enable their weight to overcome the weight and stability of the trailer. The result was the gooseneck trailer lying on its side along with the totes. The totes leaked approximately 150 gallons of HCL onto the ground thru the top vents before the emergency response team arrived to stop the leaks and begin cleanup. The emergency response team transferred the HCL inside the leaking totes into an empty tote, and transport truck provided by Veolia.

As he was looking for a location to pull over to investigate, he noticed liquid dripping from rear of the truck (~3:40 PM). The truck was immediately stopped and secured in the street (going Northbound on Ashland approaching the corner of Roosevelt). Based on the Drivers statements, and the vehicle inspection shortly thereafter, it appears the tote was secured using a E-Track Ratchet Style Strap on the passenger side rear. A drum dolly was stored near the front of the compartment which appears to have come loose and punctured the IBC bottle in two locations. Both punctures are located on the back side of the tote (opposite of the valve), and were found to matched up with the handles of the drum dolly. One hole located on the bottom corner (~2 inches)and the other being a tear (~10 inches) mid-way up the center (between the cage bars).Based on the size and location of the pictures, the IBC would have completely empties in a few minutes. The Police and Fire Department arrived within minutes to secure the area. SET Environmental was dispatch to address the vehicle decontamination, neutralization and cleanup activities (i.e. street). The truck was towed away around 11:00 PM allowing them to clean the concrete road underneath (Job completed ~12:00 AM). When the truck was returned for inspection, it was noted that the E-Track was pulled away from the truck wall having with a small tear/crack in the metal fastening location. The ratchet strap and clips appear otherwise intact (simply pulled out from the point of attachment).","The incident appears to be two fold. Firstly, the E-Track breaking free from the truck wall causing the strap to brake free. And secondly, a drum dolly that was not properly secured. As the truck is relatively new (~ 2 years old) an inquired will be made to the manufacture regarding the design/materials selected. As for the Driver's accountability, securing all products and equipment remains a daily point of focus.",Yes,IBC,"Composite, with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids and a steel outer packaging",31HA1,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,2614,Acid Products Company Inc.,US,

The frangible disc was replaced in kind. GATX 5915 was cordoned-off awaiting contract responders arrival to neutralize and clean the commodity spillage from GATX 5915's shell and a small area of ground impact around GATX 5915. The response contractor utilized a soda ash/water solution to neutralize ground impacted ballast, ties and soils. Impacted ballast and soils were excavated and placed into two disposal drums which were earmarked for appropriate disposal. The excavated site was backfilled with native soils and clean ballast; and graded to duplicate surrounding profiles. Spillage on GATX 5915 was neutralized and pressure-washed.

He asked David Schultz, Jacksonville Plant Manager, if rail car TILX110418, sitting outside of the Jacksonville facility fence, was Allied’s railcar (Jacksonville facility receiving the railcar). David answered yes. At this time per Mr. Barefiel’s instructions, both walked to the railcar to determine what was leaking from the railcar as Mr. Barefiel indicated he visually noted a leak. Upon arriving at the car that was presently stored on the rail road property, David also visually noted the leak as sodium hypochlorite was leaking from the top of the railcar. David instructed David Mason, Allied employee, to grab tools and then climb up the railcar to see what was leaking. David broke seal # 0002366 and visually inspected the railcar under the manway dome.  He noted that the three inch liquid line flange (product side) was leaking. Two of the bolts were determined to be finger loose and two were wrench tight. Using a wrench, David then tightened up the two loose bolts wrench tight as well as double checked the other two bolts to ensure they were tight. Upon immediately tightening the finger loose bolts, the sodium hypochlorite leak was mitigated.   David Schultz then called Ron Zeigler, Allied Regional Operations Manager, and reported the incident to him.   David Schultz then talked to Matthew Borchert from FEC (environmental compliance) office# 904-279-3277 cell# 904-600-2288 he said that since the rail car TILX110418 was still in there custody that FEC would take care of clean up.","UPON INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TWO BOLTS WERE FINGER LOOSE DIRECTLY RESULTING IN THE LOST OF BLEACH FROM THE RAILCAR.

There were no injuries, but the vehicle was towed.   The roadway was closed for approximately 4-hours.    Based on evidence from the accident, and a witness statement, the driver apparently decided to stop the vehicle on the shoulder.  He planned on walking across the street to his personal vehicle which had broken down on his way to work, and was parked on the opposite side of the road roughly 50 feet from where the accident occurred.  The driver apparently slowed the vehicle (confirmed by the vehicle’s tracking system) to less than 10 mph, and pulled it partially onto the roadway’s shoulder which was 4-ft wide, but soft due to recent heavy rainfall.  The shoulder apparently gave away causing the vehicle to roll over to its passenger side.    9-1-1 was notified, and the carrier was also notified.  The carrier dispatched a spill responder to the scene due to the proximity to the Piscataquog River (roughly 1200 feet).  A tow truck uprighted the vehicle. Approximately 3-5 pounds of ammonium nitrate leaked from the cargo bin during the process of moving the vehicle to an upright position. The carrier also dispatched a crash specialist, who arrived that evening and investigated the accident the next morning.     The incident was determined to be caused by driver error, pulling off the hard roadway on to the shoulder.","As a result of this accident, the carrier will do the following:    1. The driver's employment with the carrier was terminated.    2.  The carrier prepared and sent out an announcement to all of its terminals to be posted for 30 days, an alert concerning the incident/acciden and reminding all drivers of the dangers of moving a vehicle on the shoulder of rural roadways.    3.

Driver retrieved sample from the unloading valve. After, he proceeded to top of tanker, opened the manway and retrieved the sample from the top of tanker. Driver closed dome lid but did not secure it with the hold downs. After some time, the receiving person at Customer advised that the sample had failed due to cloudiness and the load was being rejected. Driver called and advised the office of the rejected load. He was then instructed to return to the plant. Driver failed to secure the dome on top of tanker. Driver left the customer and approached the intersection of S. Creek and Amnicola where he had to stop for a red light. The light changed to green. As he turned onto Amnicola Hwy, he noticed the material out of his mirrors running down the side of tanker. He pulled to the side of the roadway and stopped. He called the Univar Chattanooga Dispatcher (Chris Frazier) and advised him of what happened. The Dispatcher advised me (Robby Brewer, Branch Operations Manager) of the spill.   I arrived as well as Chattanooga Fire Dept at which time the road was shut down. Marion Environmental was called for cleanup. The entire road was closed until 1200 and then half was opened to allow traffic to flow both directions with one lane instead of normal 2 lanes in each direction. Marion finished the cleanup around 1630.  The tanker was brought back to Univar and weighed for loss of material. The difference in the gross weights from when tanker was loaded and return to the plant was 200 pounds.",Retrain and review procedures with driver,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5025,,,

This was the first transfer into tank car UTLX 14238, as the residue/empty car arrived and was spotted at the terminal back on 7/3 located on track #5.  Within a minute of starting the transfer, the transfer operator detected a very heavy odor of spent acid in the area.

The Operator notified office personnel of the spill and other personnel responded to the incident scene with spill containment supplies (sand; absorbent).  Terminal personnel then deployed spill pans under the stream and gathered some buckets and more spill pans to capture as much of the product as possible.  By 14:40 hrs Terminal personnel made notifications of said incident to TRANSFLO, Savage and DuPont along with dispatching a hazmat/environmental response crews (Pettit Environmental; EMS) to remediate the area and stop the tank car leakage.

SAFETY & EMPLOYEE RELATIONS,2280 Cassens Drive,Fenton,MO,63026,Carrier,Driver noticed a leak and pulled over on the northbound exit ramp to I35 at exit 45. Local authorities had driver move to Ritchie Brothers Facility.  Leak appeared to be from a valve area under the back of the trailer.  Load was transferred to another trailer without further incident.  Approximately 95 gallons of product leaked out but contained. Environmental contractor hired to clean-up and remediate the scene.  Trailer was internally washed and returned to St. Louis for inspection.,"It was determined that the upper internal mounting flange gasket that bolts to the sump had failed.

Investigation:  Trailer 4803 had just loaded at Eastman and the driver had come by the terminal for the shop to look at a tire on the trailer.  While the shop was looking at the tire, they noticed a small drip of liquid was dripping from the underneath the tank near the axle.  The drip was about 10-15 seconds per drop.  The product was MIBK which evaporates almost immediately.  They immediately placed a bucket underneath the leak to capture it from hitting the ground.  The product evaporated as soon as it hit the bucket due to the leak being so little.  The shop notified Jaime in dispatch and she immediately called Eastman Fire Department.  They came over to investigate and evaluated by the Fire Captain that the trailer would be safe to move back to the plant so they could unload number 5 compartment on this tank.  Once the compartment was empty at Eastman, we were instructed to clean that compartment and deliver the other 4 compartments of product to the customer in New Jersey on 8/31.  The tank was pulled from service as soon as it returned to Kingsport.  It was then cleaned and sent to Polar Service Center for them to investigate the cause of the leak.    Polar Service Center discovered small crack in the barrel located in front of the tandem where the channel ring jumps across the heater panel.  This is the highest stress area on a tank trailer due to the twisting and turning.  This is very common in compartment trailers regardless of the make and year it was manufactured.","Action taken to prevent reoccurrence:  The trailer is still in the shop being repaired.  They are lifting #2, #3 & #4 jacket sheets from the rear, the outriggers on either side of the channel ring at front of tandem.  Then remove the air tanks for access and remove section of belly pan, remove cross member and section of channel ring and pad, repair cracks in shell and install a 14 gauge pad over heater panel.  This pad will be 3 inches longer than pad when it was manufactured.  They will then install new cross member and 2 outriggers.    Then to spread the stress on this area, the following items are also being completed.  The area between #2 and #3 rings from rear above tandem sub frame needs to be enclosed.  The section, they will install laps the tubular frame on the outside and runs up and at the top where there is a bend or approximately 45 degrees to reduce the stress where it is welded to the vessel.  These are skip welded at 4” on 4” all the way around on each side of the tandem frame.    Polar Service Center in Spartanburg has been doing this type of repair for 4 years and have not had any units returned for repairs for this section of the tank.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,,,

He was traveling North in the inside lane of the 1170 block of SH 146.  A service body truck was slightly ahead of the our tractor trailer in the outside lane.  The other vehicle decided to make an unsafe U-turn, which was in front of our tractor/trailer.    PeroxyChem driver swerved to try to avoid the vehicle, but was unable to avoid hitting the other vehicle on its' side. PeroxyChem tractor/trailer ended up swerving into a ditch on other side of the road. As the vehicle rolled over, the cab struck a telephone/utility pole. Law enforcement arrived on-scene and shut down both sides of Hwy 146. Other response agencies also arrived. The hydrogen peroxide slowly leaked out the trailer vent assembly until the trailer was uprighted late in the evening. After re-scaling the trailer it was determined 198 gallons were released.     PeroxyChem Driver had to be cut out of the cab by the Mont Belvieu Fire Department (MBFD). PeroxyChem driver was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, and was subsequently released a short while later. The driver of the other vehicle appeared to be unharmed.  The other vehicle driver received a citation for ""Turned When Unsafe"".  PeroxyChem Pasadena personnel responded.",Due to the fact the incident was cased by an unsafe action by the other vehicle driver (Unsfae U-Turn directly in front of our tractor trailer) for which he received a citation from the police officer we do not have any recommendations at this time.,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC312,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,108250,PeroxyChem LLC,US,

High Street; Suite 200,Pottstown,PA,19464,Other-Facility Contracted Oper,"At approximately 8:34am, a release of approximately 334 gallons of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (UN 1301; Class 3 - Flammable; PG II), for shipper CELANESE Ltd, occurred at the Charlotte East terminal during a tank car (CELX 23036) to tanker trailer (Tidewater Transit Trailer #1192) transfer utilizing 3"" Platform Pump PLP 2135 with meter and vapor balance.  The release occurred via the rear discharge valve of TWT trailer #1192.  Operator Philip Darby failed to identify that the trailer's rear valve was not closed or capped during the truck/trailer inspection, following the trailer wash.  Terminal personnel attempted to dam and dike the immediate area, but approximately 20 gallons of product escaped over the berm located on the east side of track 9 and impacted the ground on the property directly adjacent to the terminal.  The Charlotte Fire Department was called and responded as a precaution.  EMS and representatives from Mecklenburg County also responded to the scene following the release.  Carolina Environment Response Team (CRT) arrived and cleaned up the area of the spill located on the asphalt. They filled six 55-gallon drums with absorbent material used to soak up the VAM and left the site. SWS Environmental Services was than dispatched by TRANSFLO to finalize the clean up effort. SWS excavated the affected soil and filled two 20 yard roll-off containers which are currently located onsite. The 6 55-gallon drums filled by CRT were dumped into the roll off containers for disposal. The clean up was completed at 6:00pm and the gathered material profiled/manifested for disposal.  No storm drains were impacted as the Gate Valve was immediately closed once the release was realized.","The involved operator was disciplined via two day suspension and a coaching counseling/re-training session was conducted where a commitment was obtained to ensure that trailers are thoroughly inspected prior to initiating a transfer, by walking around the entire transport and ensuring that vehicle is roadworthy, clean dry odor free or previous contents compatible with the scheduled transfer, can safely contain the lading and all valves and outlets are closed and capped.

THE SHIPMENT WAS TENDERED TO ALASKA AIRLINES IN NEWARK, NJ, AND ARRIVED IN FAIRBANKS, AK ON ALASKA FLIGHT 123 ON JULY 8, 2014. THE ALASKA MASTER AIR WAYBILL NUMBER WAS 027-11578626.

THE CARGO ON HOUSE BILL H280047117 WAS TENDERED TO EXPEDITERS BY TRIANGLE DISTRIBUTION ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS AS PART OF AN 11 LOT WEIGHING 101 POUNDS TOTAL. BECAUSE OTHER CONSIGNMENTS WERE SHIPPED AT THE SAME TIME, IN TOTAL 62 CARTONS WERE SHIPPED ON PALLETS. TRIANGLE TENDERED THE GOODS AS ""APPAREL/MERCHANDISE,"" AND DID NOT DECLARE THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. SINCE AN APPAREL SHIPMENT DID NOT REQUIRE IT, JV TRANSPORTATION DISPATCHED A DRIVER WITH NO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRAINING TO PICKUP THE GOODS. FOR THIS REASON, AND THE FACT THAT THE CARGO WAS ON PALLETS, THE DRIVER DID NOT NOTE THE LIMITED QUANTITIES MARK. THE CARGO WAS NOT RECEIVED IN EXPEDITERS' WAREHOUSE, BUT WAS TENDERED DIRECTLY TO ALASKA AIRLINES IN NEWARK BY JV TRANSPORTATION ON BEHALF OF EXPEDITORS. BECAUSE CARGO WAS AT NO TIME IN THE DIRECT POSSESSION OF EXPEDITERS, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR EXPEDITORS TO SEE THE LIMITED QUANTITIES MARK ON THE PACKAGE. THE PACKAGE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE ANCHORAGE CARGO HANDLING FACILITY BY ALASKA AIRLINES PERSONNEL. THERE WAS NO PACKAGE FAILURE OR UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS.","AMERICAN EAGLE HAS DISCUSSED THIS UNDECLARED HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SHIPMENT INTERNALLY, AND WILL CONDUCT A DANGEROUS GOODS MEETING WITH ITS DEPARTMENT HEADS OF SUPPLY CHAIN TO DISCUSS FUTURE SHIPPING NEEDS, AND DEVELOP A PLAN FOR CLASS 9 MATERIAL AS IT PERTAINS TO DIRECT TO STORE SHIPPING FROM TRANSLOADING FACILITIES SUCH AS TRIANGLE DISTRIBUTION.

This caused our unit to be pushed to the right into the soft dirt shoulder of the roadway. The driver could not recover at this point causing him to roll over onto the units top. The truck and trailer came to rest over a concrete v ditch that caught all of the oil from the truck and the amount that was released from the trailer. The truck tank had no release of product. The trailer was holding until 4 hours into the accident when a small amount started to leak on to the ground through the pressure vent near the dome. This release continued until the product was completely pumped out of the unit. The product that leaked onto the concrete ditch was diked and vacuumed by an outside company. All dirt that was contaminated was picked up and hauled away in labeled barrels. The concrete that had fuel released onto it was steam cleaned and vacuumed up as well.,We have made it mandatory that all drivers must drive with two hands on the wheel at all times.

THE CARGO ON HOUSE BULL H280047045 WAS TENDERED TO EXPEDITORS BY TRIANGLE DISTRIBUTION ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN EAGLE OUTFITTERS AS PART OF AN 8 LOT WEIGHING 104 POUNDS TOTAL.

SINCE AN APPAREL SHIPMENT DID NOT REQUIRE IT, JV TRANSPORTATION DISPATCHED A DRIVER WITH NO HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRAINING TO PICK UP THE GOODS. FOR THIS REASON, AND THE FACT THAT THE CARGO WAS ON PALLETS, THE DRIVER DID NOT NOTE THE LIMITED QUANTITIES MARK. THE CARGO WAS NOT RECEIVED IN EXPEDITORS' WAREHOUSE, BUT WAS TENDERED DIRECTLY TO ALASKA AIRLINES IN NEWARK BY JV TRANSPORTATION ON BEHALF OF EXPEDITORS. BECAUSE CARGO WAS AT NO TIME IN THE DIRECT POSSESSION OF EXPEDITORS, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR EXPEDITORS TO SEE THE LIMITED QUANTITIES MARK ON THE PACKAGE.

THE HARDENED, COOLED MATERIAL WAS THEN REMOVED FROM THE SITE AND TRANSPORTED TO A WASTE FACILITY.",THIS SPILL OCCURRED DUE TO OUR DRIVER SPEEDING IN A CURVE.  THE DRIVER WAS TERMINATED AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION AS FAILURE TO SLOW DOWN AND OBEY THE SPEED LIMIT WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE SPILL.

He applied the brakes causing the drums to brake free from the rope holding the drums in place. A vehicle behind the tractor/trailer noticed there was something leaking from the trailer and he pulled up to Gene to advise him of the leak. Gene pulled over and verified the leak, at which point he called emergency responders and his supervisor to the scene.The drum was secured with a 1/4"" poly rope with 1,100 Ibs per sq inch tinsel strength (per manufacturers specs),wrapped five (5) times around the drums, blocked and braced with other freight. When the brakes were applied to avoid hitting the deer, the rope snapped allowing the drum to slide off the pallet cracking the bottom of the drum.The duration of the release and clean up was approximately 12 hours long.","Recommendation and action taken, load hazardous materials freight in the nose of the trailer, purchase and use athicker 1/2"" nylon rope with a greater tensile strength due to the force from a sudden stop.",Yes,DRUM NON-METAL,"Fiber drum, cont1 for solids, cont2 for liquids",DRUM FBR,No,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,2,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,12137,MOUNTAIN VALLEY EXPRESS CO INC,US,
