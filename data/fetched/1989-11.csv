THE LOADER MADE A DECISION TO USE AN UNAUTHORIZED COMPRESSOR. THIS COMPRESSOR APPARENTLY WAS OF GREATER POWER THAN THE APPROVED COMPRESSOR AND WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH A PRESSURE GUAGE. THIS APPARENTLY RESULTED IN EXCESS PRESSURIZATION OF THE RAIL CAR. ON DETERMINATION THAT SUFFICIENT PRODUCT HAD BEEN TRANSLOADED TO THE TRAILER, THE LOADER, WHO WAS ON THE GROUND, INSTRUCTED THE ASSISTANT ON TOP OF THE RAIL CAR TO CLOSE THE VALVE. ON APPLYING PRESSURE TO CLOSE THE VALVE, THE VALVE BROKE. PRODUCT UNDER PRESSURE IN THE RAIL CAR WAS FORCED OUT OF THE UNRESTRICTED VALVE OPENING. AMOUNT LOST:   IT IS ESTIMATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 6,000 GALLONS OF PRODUCT WAS LOST. THIS IS DETERMINED BY GUAGING THE RAIL CAR. REMEDIAL ACTION TAKEN:  FOUR SEASONS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES WAS CALLED IMMEDIATELY AT TIME OF SPILL AND WERE ON THE SCENE IN APROXIMATELY FOUR HOURS. THE FERRIC CHLORIDE WAS CONTAINED, COLLECTED AND REMOVED.  A COPY OF THE CLEAN UP COMPANY'S ACTIVITY REPORT IS ATTACHED. PREVENTIVE MEASURES PLANNED:  1. EMPLOYMENT OF THE LOADER HAS BEEN TERMINATED FOR FAILURE TO FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PROCEDURE. 2. THE UNAUTHORIZED COMPRESSOR HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE PREMISES.  ALL LOADER HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PROCEDURE AND TO USE ONLY AUTHORIZED EQUIPMENT. 3. A STAINLESS STEEL OR OTHER METAL VALVE WITH APPROPRIATE LINING IS BEING SECURED FOR USE ON THE RAIL CAR.
