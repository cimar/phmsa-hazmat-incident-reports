Inspoection of release indicated a UTLX 902455 loaded with Methyl Methacrylate, inspection of the top valve arrangement indicated a ""weeping"" of the material was coming from a connection with a Cam Lock Cap covering this item. On removal of the Cam Lock a ""4"" Dry Break Fitting was discovered to have product weeping from the spring area of this fitting which is mounted as one unit on the Top Ball Valve body. As the material weeped from the mentioned area it was noted material was evaporating as quickly as it was weeped. Since the materials needed to repair were not available in house. Chemtrec was contacted who in turn had a representative from Rohm and Haas Chemical Co.contact the Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis (TRRA) and in turn Rohm and Haas dispatched their Emergency Response group from Louisville Ky. Om arrival their inspection revealed there was material trapped between valve body and the 4"" Dry Break Fitting. At this time the car was depressurized and the trap material placed back into the car. The duration of the release on TRRA was approximately 14hrs","Since this is the first time involved with this type of fitting it is very possible while the car was being loaded and the loading process was completed the loader perhaps closed the top body valve prior to prior to diconnecting the 4"" Dry Break Fitting thus trapping material between the valve body and the 4"" Dry Break Fitting which allowed the material to weep.

BNSF and contract responders inspected UELX 78039 finding the leak source at the bottom outlet closure cap (BOC). Responders also noted that the bottom operated BOV's operating handle was pinned in a closed position but was mobile, which may have allowed the valve to open slightly. The responders tool tightened the BOC one full turn and inserted a wooden wedge against the valve's operating handle to keep it from moving from the closed position. Afterwards, no further product drips were observed and all spillage evaporated. The BOC gasket was not inspected. Response was concluded by 0910 hrs. CDT, 6/01/2010.

While conducting a pre-trip inspection prior to moving the trailer, it was discovered that material had leaked from the trailer onto the ground where the trailer was staged.  Facility personnel activated the in-house spill response team to address the incident.  Using appropriate personnel protective equipment, the response team entered the trailer and identified a 55 gallon non-bulk package leaking from the seam of the container.  Facility personnel isolated the container and placed it into a suitable salvage drum.  In addition, contaminated soil was removed from the trailer parking area and placed into containers for disposal.  Clean fill was spread over the affected area and returned to its normal condition.  The trailer floor was decontaminated and all material generated from this activity was also containerized for disposal. The salvage drum containing the damaged container along with all material generated in the response activities were loaded onto the trailer and sent for disposal at the intended waste management facility.","At the time the container was accepted for transportation there was no evidence of leaking or damage.  Upon examination of the container during the spill response activities, it was noted that the container used was rated for solids and/or inner containers.  The driver that inspected the container will be re-trained on the container inspection process to insure that container markings are viewed to insure a suitable container was selected.

KIRK HIGBIE,DIRECTOR OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL,8934 Manchester St,Houston,TX,77012,Carrier,"At approximately 2350 hours on Sunday, June 13, PTRA train crew 280 notified the Trainmaster that tank car UTLX 649778 was leaking product from the dome area when the car was moved during normal switching in the yard.  Upon discovery, Valero Marketing and Supply in Houston, TX was called to determine the cause of the leak. The local shift supervisor arrived on scene and determined that product was leaking from the ""vent pipe"" and was probably an overload. This was not the case. On Monday morning the PTRA Safety Director inspected that car and deterined that the cause of the leak was a defective vaccuum relief valve. Since no product was actively leaking or contacting the ground the car was moved into track 210 next to the access road where repair crews could replace the vaccuum relief valve.  We contacted Valero Marketing and Supply in San Antonio to request that they send a crew out to repair the care. After several calls Valero contracted ULTX rail car repair services to repair the car. UTLX Rail Car arrived on scene Tuesday, June 15 at 8:25 AM. They inspected and replaced the manway gasket and replaced the vacuum relief valve. It was determined that the vaccuum relief valve had a broken spring and was not closing thus allowing product to spray down the side of the tank car when moved. Less than one gallon of product was released.

Non-clear liquid drops were also observed emanating from the bottom outlet closures. Apparently, CSXT 259565 sustained water incursion either prior to loading, during loading or enroute. The water gravitated to the bottom of the interior hoppers and mixed with dry product forming a diluted mineral rich watery mixture that seeped through the closed outlets. Some of this mixture dried on the exterior bottom outlets forming white crystalline stalactite type formations. A shipper contractor cleaned this dried material from the bottom outlet structures, capturing the material in receptacles and this material was later returned to the lading. The top hatchways were inspected and deemed secure. Response was concluded by 1700 hrs. PDT, 6/07/2010.   Later, while CSXT 259565 was still at the repair facility, it was again reported oozing a thick liquid mixture from this hopper's bottom outlets. On 6/10/2010, the same response contractor cleaned this material from the bottom outlets. The bottom outlets were then sealed with 'Plug N Dike' sealant and over sealed with duct tape to ensure a water tight barrier. Afterwards, no further liquid leakage was observed and CSXT 259565 was released to proceed to its destination. This response was concluded by 1730 hrs.

The State Police was notified, but their Trooper John Daryies did not respond and was advised by phone. The shipper was contacted and actively responded with KCS to this incident. The defective bottom outlet valve causes this package to be a DOT non-complying hazmat package and will require an FRA one time movement approval to deliver this car to home-shop for repair to the BOV.

The load then was taken to the intended waste disposal facility.","An investigation found that the load had apparently gotten wet from the rainwater due to a leak in the tarp.  This caused the material inside to get wet and heavy and shift when the box was lifted.  The tarp leaked due to the fact that while sitting in the yard, the tarp is subjected to rainwater collecting on top and also harsh sunlight, causing the deterioration.  The rolloff boxes are intermodal type boxes where the tarp fits flat.  If the boxes could have bows placed in them to angle off the rainwater, this problem would not have occurred.

While making a delivery to Tidewater Supply Co. approximately 200-400 gallons of product were released.  Apparently the release was the result of a fitting on the outlet of the Tidewater Supply Co. tank, cracking and failing.  The product filled the containment area, resulting in the containment area overflowing.  The free product  impacted a nearby drainage ditch.  Liquid Cargo, Inc. dispatched Miller Environmental Group of Smyrna, Delaware to perform an investigation of the site.    Miller Environmental Group arrived on-site and completed PH testing on the drainage ditch and nearby pond and the results were neutral.      Tidewater Supply Company will coordinate additional site remediation as required.","Since the release was accidental and may have been the result of a fitting on the outlet cracking, no actions have been taken to prevent recurrence.

The material is described by waste profile as ""Sodium Carbonate Contaminated with Cyanide,"" 100% solid.  The constituents are listed as Sodium Carbonate (99.9-100%), with up to 0.002% cyanide contamination.  The waste material was manifested for disposal at the Clean Harbors facility in El Dorado, AR, and was held at the Bridgeport, NJ, 10-transfer facility awaiting outbound shipment.  On the morning of Wednesday, 6/16, 2 of the 21 cubic yard boxes were found to have moisture on the outside of the containers coming from inside the boxes during daily facility inspections.  Local Clean Harbors emergency response personnel donned the proper PPE and transferred the material to drums and packaged for disposal all portions of the original containers.  During the transfer of material, they noted moisture in the material (similar to a hard-pack snow, little to no free liquid).  The remaining 19 containers were fully inspected on all outer surfaces for any signs of exterior moisture and the containers were then opened to confirm that there was a liner in place and the material didn't exhibit any form of moisture as found in the failed containers; all 19 containers were found to be in good condition.  All material was shipped on 6/18/10 including the drummed material, debris created from the repacking and the original 19 uneffected containers.","With the possibility of moisture in the waste material, it was determined upon consultation with Apollo Metals that all future packaging should be in drums to prevent any possible compromise of the container.",No,IBC,"Fiberboard, for solids",11G,Yes,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,0,2,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,5000,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

The responder also reported a strong odor emanating from within this container and observed a wet spot atop the container floor. The intermodal flatcar with JBHU 246339 aboard was set-out from the train for a detailed inspection. A BNSF contractor working on site was contacted to ascertain and remedy any possible leak source within JBHU 246339.  The contractor reported finding a palletized 5 gallon poly drum had leaked some contents via its capped bung hole.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Transammonia, Inc, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report# 2010-06-17-00199).  Eagle/SWS, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found product vapors coming from the vapor valve which was slightly open and the vapor valve plug was out.  The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Ms. Angie King (813-261-0600).  Eagle/SWS personnel closed the vapor valve and installed the valve plug wrench tight.  The leak was secured and the car was released for transport.

Due to the presence of a strong odor, the dockworkers were instructed to stay away from the trailer until I had contacted Chemtrec to determine if it was safe for us to clean up. They cleared us to do so. Upon restacking of the jugs, it was discovered that only a minute amount of liquid had escaped from one of the screw on caps. The jug was set upright and the cap secured.

He had taken one of the two drums into the Central Heating Plant and was on his way in with the second drum.  Upon getting to the garage door, the drum dolly got hung up on the lip of the garage floor.  Driver pushed it back and then pulled it hard to get the drum dolly up on the lip.  The drum bounced on the drum dolly and then tilted slightly and then ended up puncturing the drum on the lower side.  Driver immediately had the reciever help him get drum off of the drum dolly and flipped on side to stop the spillage.  All the spillage (approximately two gallons) was contained on a concrete floor.  The local fire department responded and under direction of the shipper cleaned up the spilled material.  Customer kept all the product and the cleaned up material.  Due to material being a poison, the markings were not able to be obtained off of the drum.  Additionally, it is not known 100% if the feet of the drum dolly were not properly placed under the drum or if the bouncing or another item (such as a bolt on drum dolly) actually punctured the drum.","Drivers are trained in use of drum dolly and other freight handling equipment.  When the driver realized he was having an issue getting the second drum over the concrete lip, for whatever reason, he should have obtained assistance to both steady the drum and to push it up and over the lip.  To push and then pull it harder to get it over the lip risk injury and obviously a greater risk for an incident.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Plastic drum,DRUM PLS,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Pitt Ohio Express, LLC",US,

He was bleeding off the pressure through the bottom bleeder valve and was standing down-wind.  He evidentally did not bleed all the pressure off so when he uncoupled from the valve a light mist sprayed up under his face shield and got on his face.  He was wearing all of the proper personal protective equipment except he wasn't wearing his goggles as we require.  None thankfully got in his eyes.  It did get on the skin on his face.  Because the mist was so light he said he didn't take it as a real concern and finished disconnecting, drove to the nearest truck stop, entered the bathroom and found that his face was bright red and that he was out of breath.  He notified us and we immediately had him contact an ambulance to come bring him in for evaluation.  He was given an inhalor and some topical creme.",In this example nothing failed from an equipment perspective.  This falls back on driver training.  He has been brought back in and interviewed.  He was then run through Performance Enhancement Training outlining our personal protective equipment requirements as well as the proper procedures for unloading.  Standing downwind was not the right choice.

A CSXT conductor was splashed with product but did not require or seek medical attention, as he showered and returned to work. The car was isolated and the shipper, Illinois Corn Processing LLC (subsidiary of MGP Ingredients) was notified via CHEMTREC (Report #2010-06-15-00224).   Environmental Products + Services Inc. (EP+S) of Vermont, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene to make repairs.  Upon arrival, EP+S representatives found 3 manway cover bolts were less than hand tight, 2 bolts on the liquid line flange were less than hand tight and the manway cover gasket had deteriorated.  The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Dan Nolan (913-426-5457).  EP+S personnel tightened the manway cover bolts and the bolts on the liquid line flange tool tight.  EP+S did not have the correct size replacement manway cover gasket and cut one to fit.  The leak was secured and the car was set aside for the shipper to replace the manway gasket.    This incident did require a special shipping move.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder's detailed inspection revealed the product was being expelled from the liquid valve's threaded pipe connection and was evaporating on the side shell. The liquid valve was in the closed position. The responder reduced internal pressure within TILX 199866 via the vapor valve and the product release subsided. The responder removed the liquid valve's handle allowing the responder to tool tightened the threaded liquid valve by almost two full turns. Securement was completed by 1700 hrs.

The ARR crew reported to the BNSF that UTLX 201054 was leaking product from the top fitting area. BNSF responders placed absorbent pads to catch the product drips that were slowly dripping off both sides of UTLX 201054's tank shell. The product leak source was from the liquid valve's threaded connection. A BNSF contract responder checked the internal pressure and product outage within UTLX 201054. The pressure was measured at 5-8 psi with 6 1/2 inches of product outage. The internal pressure was reduced via the vapor valve which ended the product release at the liquid valve connection. The liquid valve was in the closed position and the contract responders removed the liquid valve finding no thread sealant on the threaded connection. All threaded connections were cleaned and new Teflon sealant was applied to the threaded area. The liquid valve was then resecured. Spillage on the side shell of UTLX 201054 was decontaminated with a degreasing agent. Intact seal removed numbered 2573122 and replaced with seal numbered 477313. Response was concluded by 1915 hrs.

The truck pulled into a truck stop for a brief time at exit 4 near Vinton, LA. A walk around inspection was performed by the driver. He got back on the road heading west. About 25 miles, later a call was received on the CB alerting the driver of smoke coming from his trailer. The driver stopped the truck and saw a fire at the trailer driver side front axle inner tire from the 9 to 2 o'clock position. The fire spread throughout the back-end axle system. A fire extinguisher was used without success. A call was placed for fire equipment to be sent to the scene. 2 fire trucks and a backup water truck provided the necessary capacity to extinguish the fire and wet down the cargo tank. There was no failure of the tank, valves or hoses. No leaks resulted. However, the damage from the fire was such that integrity testing on the tank will be done and all the piping will probably be replaced.It is believed the fire was initiated by excessive heat created by a failure in the braking system. This failure led to a partial brake drag not noticed by the driver (more likely if only one brake is dragging). Heat was created by the friction of the brake liner and the brake drum. The brake drum, which sits inside the inner tire (where the fire was initially noticed), created enough heat to eventually ignite the tire.Brake drag can be caused by several factors. Unfortunately, most of the evidence for this was burned in the fire. Possible component failures that could cause brake drag that were not able to be ruled out are:- Brake Chamber middle seal leak. (HIGH),- Partial activation and sticking of Hand Brake. (MED),- Service Brake Valve leak through. (LOW)","The MC412 cargo tank utilized in Hydrogen Fluoride service did not fail which is a testimony to the effectiveness of the package as designed. Based on the possible causes shown above, the following will be implemented:CAUSES CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Brake Chamber middle seal leak. (HI) Add change out on 5 year PM.

THE SCHIBER DRIVER, WHO HAS BEEN WITH SCHIBER TRUCK DO. FOR APPROXIMATELY 3.5 YEARS, ARRIVED AT RHODIA WITH A LOAD OF APPROXIMATELY 3600 GALLONS OF MOLTEN SULFUR AROUND 9PM.  THE DRIVER PROCEEDED TO PREPARE HIS TRAILER FOR UNLOADING AND WHEN HE WENT TO THE REAR OF THE TRAILER TO START ATTACHING THE UNLOADING HOSE HE FOLLOWED PROCEDURES BY FEELING THE CAP OF THE UNLOADING VALVE AND DETERMINED IT TO BE WARM, BUT NOT HOT.  WHEN HE STARTED TO REMOVED THE CAP, SULFUR BEGAN TO FLOW OUT OF THE VALVE.  HE TRIED TO PUSH THE CAP BACK ON BUT WAS UNABLE TO.  AT THIS POINT HE TRIED TO CLOSE THE UNLOADING VALVE, BUT IT WAS ALREADY IN THE CLOSED POSITION AND HE DETERMINED IT MUST HAVE BEEN BOUND UP.  HE THEN RAN TO THE EMERGENCY PHONE AND HAD THE OPERATOR BRING A PIPE WRENCH WHICH HE USED TO TRY AND CLOSE THE VALVE THE REST OF THE WAY BUT WAS STILL UNABLE TO.  AT THIS POINT THE DRIVER NOTICED THE TRAILER WOULD GASP FOR AIR PERIODICALLY AS THE DOME LID WAS STILL IN THE CLOSED POSITION WHICH IS ALSO IN THE WRITTEN PROCEDURES.  DURING ONE OF THESE BRIEF MOMENTS, HE WAS ABLE TO RECONNECT THE CAP TO CONTAIN THE REST OF THE LOAD.  ONCE THE DRIVER WAS EVENTUALLY ABLE TO CAP THE DISCHARGE VALVE AND STOP THE FLOW OF SULFUR HE THEN CONTACTED SCHIBER TRUCK COMPANY AND NOTIFIED THEM OF THE SPILL.  A SCHIBER TRUCK CO. REPRESENTATIVE CAUGHT A FLIGHT TO CHICAGO EARLY THE FOLLOWING MORNING TO MEET WITH RHODIA AND DISCUSS THE SPILL WHICH HAD ENTERED THE STORM DRAIN BY THE UNLOADING AREA AND RAN UNDERGROUND THROUGH THE STORM DRAIN SYSTEM.  AN OUTSIDE COMPANY WAS HIRED IN TO CLEANUP THE ENTIRE SPILL.  IT WAS FIRST DISCOVERED UPON INVESTIGATION THAT THE VALVE GEARS WERE WORN AND WHICH IT HARD TO CLOSE.  ONCE THE VALVE GOT INTO A BIND THE SHEAR PIN BROKE FROM THE DRIVER TRYING TO CLOSE IT SO HARD.  THIS BROKEN PIN GOT IN BETWEEN THE GEARS AND MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CLOSE.  ONCE THE DRIVER GOT THE PIPE WRENCH HE TURNED IT SO HARD THAT IT BROKE THE HANDLE AND PUT IT IN A FREE SPIN, AT THIS POINT THE VALVE WAS USELESS AND HAD TO REMAIN IN THE POSITION IT WAS IN WHICH WAS ALMOST CLOSED, BUT STILL ALLOWED SULFUR TO FLOW THROUGH IT.  IT WAS ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THE VACUUM CREATED BY THE SPILL RUPTURED THE VENT DISC ON TOP OF THE TRAILER ALLOWING AIRE TO BE INTRODUCED TO THE EQUATION.  THIS INCREASED AIRFLOW CAUSED A GREATER FLOW OF SULFUR TO EXIT THE TRAILER AND DELAYED THE GASPS FOR AIR.  THESE DISCS ARE IN PLACE TO PREVENT OVER PRESSURIZATION OF THE TRAILER AND DESIGNED TO BREAK IF TOO MUCH AIR IS INTRODUCED TO THE TANK.  IN THIS CASE, THE RAPID SUCTION EFFECT THAT WAS EXPERIENCED CAUSED THE DISC TO BREAK AS WELL.  HAD THIS DISC NOT RUPTURED THE TRAILER WOULD HAVE GASPED FOR AIR MORE FREQUENTLY AND THE DRIVER WOULD HAVE MOSTE LIKELY BEEN ABLE TO MINIMIZE THE SPILL.  THE DRIVER WAS GIVEN TWO DAYS OFF WHILE WE INVESTIGATED THE SPILL TO DETERMINE","AFTER REVIEWING THE INCIDENT, SCHIBER TRUCK CO. HAS DECIDED TO BEGIN MOUNTING A THERMOMETER ON ALL UNLOADING VALVES SO THAT THE DRIVERS WILL BE ABLE TO TELL IF THERE IS PRODUCT BEHIND THE CAP.  THIS SHOULD PROVE TO BE MORE ACCURATE THAN USING YOUR HAND TO FEEL THE CAP.  IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THERE IS PRODUCT BEHIND THE CAP, THE LOAD WILL NOT BE UNLOADED, BUT RATHER DROPPED AT THE YARD TO HARDEN AND THEN PUT ON STEAM TO UNLOAD WITH ALL VALVES AND HOSES ALREADY IN PLACE.  IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT RHODIA COULD HAVE LESSENED THE EXTENT OF THE SPILL BY USING DRAIN COVER MATS THAT MANY FACILITIES USE TO PREVENT THIS EXACT SAME INCIDENT.

The crew on a BNSF train in a nearby siding confirmed via a roll-by inspection that the suspect train had entrained UTLX 951443 (DOT 112J400W tank car) emanating a vapor from a top fitting. Train was stopped and held at Catale, OK for inspection by hazardous material responders. BNSF contract responders reported that the pressure relief device (PRD) had allowed product to escape and that the product vapor release had ebbed after the product's auto-refrigerating process occurred. The responders successfully applied a capping kit to fully enclose and seal off the PRD. FRA Movement Approval FRA-0620001V was received to transport UTLX 951443 to the next rail terminal (Tulsa, OK) for product transfer and PRD replacement. UTLX 951443 arrived at the BNSF Tulsa railyard without further incident. On 6/22/2010, BNSF contract responders off-loaded product within UTLX 951443 into tanker trucks. After UTLX 951443 was unloaded, responders flared-off remaining product inside UTLX 951443. The failed PRD had a broken stem at the lower threaded portion of the stem shaft. The PRD spring, follower and the broken bottom stem shaft piece with associated nut hardware still attached were fished out from the bottom of the empty tank. Later on 6/22/2010, a shipper contractor installed a replacement PRD onto UTLX 951443.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected PPRX 29400 and detected a slight product odor at ground level next to  PPRX 29400. Also, product vapor hissing was audible at the manway closure. The manway securement bolts were tool tight and the manway gasket seal was suspected as the pathway of the product vapor release. PPRX 29400 was then carefully moved and isolated in the railyard. On 6/29/2010, BNSF contract responders were called to assist in stopping the vapor release. The responders reduced the internal pressure (measured at 5 psi) via the vapor line in order to inspect the manway gasket. The manway gasket was found to be in a deteriorated condition and falling apart. A new manway gasket was applied and the manway was resecured. The closure plug on the vapor line was cleaned, new thread sealant applied and resecured. Afterwards, no further product odor or vapor release was detectable. The responders returned the next morning (6/30/2010) to recheck PPRX 29400. Internal pressure within PPRX 29400 was still holding at 0 psi and no product vapor was detectable on the air monitoring devices utilized (4 gas/PID). The new seal applied to the manway cover was numbered 477317 and the new seal applied to the valve housing cover was numbered 477319. The side specification stencil on PPRX 29400 indicated that the last tank qualification was completed in the year 2005 and next due in 2015.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,12005,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Driver trouble shot electronic equipment but still could not create pressure at the fueling nozzle. After additional investigation, driver observed that there was a rupture in the hose beneath the truck from the pump to the discharge meter. The rupture was approximately 3 inches long adjacent to where the hose is connected to a factory manufactured fitting. At that point the driver shut down truck and pump and secured the area to keep all personnel from the area until proper response people arrived at site.

CELLUCCI,"VICE PRESIDENT, TRANSPORTATION COMPLIANCE",42 Longwater Dr,Norwell,MA,02061,Carrier,"A shipment containing polychlorinated biphenyl debris (transformer carcasses and bushings) was offered for transportation via rail.  During the course of transportation, the rail car was received at Clean Harbor’s Clive, Utah facility where the material was transferred from the rail car into dump trailers for the final leg of transportation activities (the intended waste management facility is not rail served).  At the conclusion of the transfer operation where the material was moved from the rail car into the dump trailers, residual liquid that was not identified at the time of initial loading or transfer escaped from the transformer carcasses onto the contained vehicle loading area.   Facility personnel immediately initiated a response action that involved the containment and collection of all material released from the transport vehicle.  All material that was collected was placed into suitable non bulk packages along with all clean –up debris.  The affected area was decontaminated and all decontamination medial was containerized for disposal as well.  Once the clean –up was complete, facility personnel re secured the dump trailer and this vehicle, along with all clean-up debris were transported to the intended waste management facility where it was disposed of.","A review of the incident identified that cause of this incident can be attributed to small amounts of residual liquid remaining in individual transformer carcasses and which escaped from the transformers and mixed with the debris being transported for disposal.  Once the rail car was unloaded, this residual liquid pooled on the bottom of the dump trailer where it escaped from the rear seal of the cargo carrying portion.      In order to prevent a recurrence, the shipper of the material is investigating the preparation and loading of this particular shipment as it was supposed to only container fully drained transformers and related debris.  Appropriate corrective actions will e taken to insure that any debris sent for transportation is free of all residual liquids.  In addition, the facility that prepared the dump trailer for continuing transportation has reviewed the incident with the loading personnel and has reviewed the steps necessary to properly secure an end dump.  One suspected contributing cause of this incident was a rear door seal that was not properly secured.  This rear seal allowed the residual liquid to escape from the package onto the contained loading area. Facility personnel will insure that rear door seals are inspected prior to closure to insure that the area between the door and the gasket is free of all debris that could cause the closure device to seal properly.",No,HOPPER,Highway hopper trailer for solid materials only,HOPPER T,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Clean Harbors Environmental Services Inc,US,

Hunt Corporate Drive,LOWELL,AR,72745,Carrier,"Improper blocking/bracing contributed to a load shift in transit resulting in a hazmat spill that was detected when the container de-ramped in Portland, OR.  Approximately seven (7) gallons of corrosive liquid, basic, organic, n.o.s.(ethanol amine) Class 8, packing group II was found to be leaking from the container (cofc).  Container was taken to the hazmat pit by rail personnel.  Upon inspection of the interior of the container several pallets of hazardous and non-hazardous materials were found to have load shifted.  Approximately 85 total gallons of ethanol amine were discovered to have spilled, the majority still in the container, intermixed with non-haz floor sealer.  Hazmat contractor was contracted by J.B. Hunt to conduct hazmat containment; contractor dispatched subcontractor to the site to conduct the clean-up efforts.  Photos obtained by subcontractor revealed minimal-to-no load blocking and bracing had been conducted by the shipper.  Subsequent investigation by J.B. Hunt personnel and by the load consigner, Staples, led to a recommendation to the shipper (Carroll Company) to review their loading practices.",This was the first of two similiar incidents involving the same shipper occuring withing an approxiametly two week timespan.  Both incidents were due to improper blocking/bracing.  This issue has been addressed with the shipper and with the consigner; additionally the railroad has begun to inspect shipments originating from this carrier.  Shipper has been advised by both J.B.

(K049) generated from the cleaning of a tank that had contained slop oil emulsion solids.  At the time the shipment was accepted for transportation, the load was inspected and no evidence of heat or vapors were identified.  During the course of the trip, the driver observed a small amount of smoke coming from under the roll-off’s closure device.  The driver immediately pulled off the roadway and identified that the solid material appeared to be smoldering (please note that at no time were flames visual.  Part 4, section 30 indicates fire as one of the results but it is important to clarify that the load was smoldering and not engulfed in flames).  At this point, the driver placed the container on the ground and removed the power unit from the area.  Once this was accomplished, local emergency services, the shipper and the driver’s home dispatcher were notified of the situation.  The local Fire Department, A representative from the Texas DOT and response crews from both the transporter and shipper attended the scene and upon arrival, it was determined that the best course of action was to cover the material with a fire fighting foam.  During this operation, the road was closed by the local authorities as a precaution.   Once secured and it was determined that the smoldering material was extinguished, the TX DOT requested that the container be rejected back to the shippers location.  This was accomplished without incident.  While pending approval to move the container, notifications were also made to the National Response Center and the Texas Department of Environmental Quality.  Representatives from these 2 agencies also arrived at the scene to observe the response activities.  Please note that amount of material released is only an estimate as the only visible release was the smoke released as the material smoldered.","At the time the material was inspected for transportation, no evidence of heat and/or smoke was observed.  As a result of the incident, however, the approval to ship this waste stream has been suspended pending the results of an internal investigation being performed by the shipper.  As of this time, the results of the investigation are not available.

Apparently, an unknown vehicle struck the front end of SNTU 400189's attached chassis which caused the chassis to skid sideways collapsing one of the chassis' support stanchions.  SNTU 400189 came to rest leaning against the rail flatcar. The lean angle of SNTU 400189 forced liquid commodity out from its pressure/vacuum relief valve at the top of SNTU 400189.  The product release stopped when SNTU 400189 was up-righted by BNSF contract responders.  The chassis was then connected to a hostler truck's trailer hitch to steady SNTU 400189 until it was loaded atop another suitable chassis.  Product spillage on the impacted rail flatcar was cleaned.

WEISS,PROJECT MANAGER,1875 West Main Street,Bartow,FL,33830,Other-Spill Management Company,"On Tuesday, June 8, 2010, at 1310 hours EST, Southern Refrigerated Transport contacted American Compliance Technologies, Inc. (A•C•T) Project Manager, Mr. Wayne Koszegi, CHMM to request assistance with a paint spill. The spill occurred at the PPG Industries facility located at 4820 Mehurin Street in Jefferson, LA.  SRT advised that the spill was noticed when paint was seen dripping onto the pavement.    Utilizing A•C•T’s pre-approved nationwide database of emergency response teams, A•C•T contracted with United States Environmental Services to assess and conduct cleanup operations, as necessary.    A•C•T and its representatives are committed to providing a safe work environment for all of its employees and clients.  An important part of the A•C•T Contractor Safety Program is contractor safety prequalification.  To qualify to work on an A•C•T site, all companies must successfully complete the safety prequalification process and meet A•C•T’s level of safety excellence.  Our response team utilized on this spill has met the minimum requirements to be a subcontractor for A•C•T.    Upon arrival at the site, our response team reported that the trailer was full and would need to be off-loaded prior to assessment.  A forklift at the facility was used to remove undamaged product in order to access the source of the release.  It was discovered that 24 – 5 gallon pails of paint had come off their pallets due to a broken keeper rail.  SRT requested that the pails be over-packed and left on the trailer.  The damaged paint cans were removed from the rear of the trailer and placed into six (6) 55-gallon drums and then reloaded onto the trailer.  The responders reported that three pallets required disposal, and these were also placed back onto the trailer.  Much of the paint had begun to dry and was difficult to remove.  In an attempt to remove as much of the paint as possible sorbent pads were used to soak up the still wet paint.  Granular sorbents were then applied and brushed into the trailer floor.  The paint-contaminated granular sorbent was collected using a vacuum.  The response team finished wiping down the back of the trailer of the liquid paint and hand excavated the paint impacted rocks and soil from under the trailer, which was placed into 55-gallon drums.  All damaged product and cleanup debris was reloaded onto the trailer.    On June 9, 2010, SRT requested that the previously overpacked, damaged paint cans be removed from the trailer and properly disposed of.  The vehicle had traveled into Texas at this point and our network subcontractor Milstead Environmental was contacted to facilitate the offload and disposal of the material.  ACT directed the SRT driver to the Milstead Environmental facility where the activities would take place.  Using a forklift our response team offloaded the pallets of overpacked 55-gallon drums and staged them at their facility pending waste profiling and transport and disposal.

When the driver was taking a curve near the Bob Hope Drive off ramp his trailer rolled to the right.  The driver contacted the dispatch supervisor who in turn alerted Pacific Tank Lines management.  CHP was on the scene within two minutes of the incident. Shortly after, Fire Departments from multiple cities also arrived on scene.  Pacific Tank Lines Operations Team immediately dispatched their Hazmat and Environmental Team.  A pump truck was also dispatched to the location to assist if needed.  Pacific Tank Lines Safety team arrived within 30 minutes of the incident and began coordinating the vehicle recovery and spill response with all local agencies that were on site.  As result of the incident 4,500 gallons of gasoline was spilled to the ground.  Pacific Tank Lines, Inc. commenced an incident investigation. Pacific Tank Lines, Inc. investigation team determined that the most likely scenario was that the trailer drifted from the path of travel and dropped a wheel into a small storm water gutter running along the edge of the freeway immediately to the right of the lane.  As a consequence of the driver’s actions in attempting to steer the trailer back to the lane of travel, the trailer rolled over, sustaining considerable damage to the tank and causing a spill of 4,500 gallons of gasoline.  The product flowed from the highway into a rain water runoff catch basin below the highway.  The product then ran from the catch basin onto the city street and flowed into an aggregate catch basin in a city park.   The damage to the trailer consisted of three tears in the side bulkhead from the trailer sliding 687’ on the roadway. After the emergency response the vehicle was up righted and was inspected. It was found that there was no other damage to the trailer and could be driven from the scene, Pacific Tank Lines, Inc. decided to tow the trailer to a designated terminal for further inspection.","Pacific Tank Lines, Inc. has implemented new driving instructions for traveling on SR-134 in Burbank CA. to include that drivers are to travel in the #2 lane only when on the portion of the 134. This will be documented in the required journey plan for the route. Pacific Tank Lines, Inc. does conduct roll over training for all of its drivers and will continue to conduct the company required training.   Pacific Tank Lines would like to recommend that the city of Burbank CA. look into the option of removing the small culvert in an attempt to avoid another roll over type incident from occurring in that section of SR-134.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,27467818,Pacific Tank Lines Inc,US,

OWENS,DIRECTOR SAFETY AND COMPLIANCE,5163 WOLFPEN PLEASANT HILL RD,MILFORD,OH,45150,Carrier,"Driver arrived at delivery location for delivery of no lead gasoline; positioned vehicle for delivery and stuck product tanks for capacity and capacity calculations. Driver then proceeded to set up his off load equipment preparatory to the unloading process. Driver advised that he was setting up to deliver two (2) compartments of gasoline product off of his transport trailer; that he connected two (2) delivery drop fittings into the connections to the drop fittings of the facilities two (2) no lead gasoline storage tanks; that he pulled two (2) product hoses off trailer and onto the ground; that he pulled two vapor recovery hoses off trailer onto ground; that he made connection of the shorter of the two product hoses to the drop fitting to the facility storage tank and also connected it to the unload head on the trailer; he then connected the longer of his two delivery hoses to the unload head on the trailer (However, the error was that the driver had failed to connect the “longer” hose to the second NL tank delivery fitting — it was left un-connected lying on the ground next to the tank drop fitting); drive then started flow of product off trailer. Driver states he immediately saw product coming out of the end of the “un-connected” long product hose onto the ground and that he shut the trailer valves off to cease the flow of product. Driver advised that no more than 3 to 4 seconds could have passed from the time he started product flow! observed product coming out of the un-connected hose and when he had shut valves off and product flow ceased. (Using the average gravity product flow rate of 240 gallons per minute (4 gallons per second); it was felt that the no more than 20 gallons of product was spilled). Driver called our operations staff and call forwarded to director of safety. Driver was advised to place call to 911 for immediate fire department response and to advise customer clerk in attendance to make appropriate notification to their personnel. On-site inspection was that some of the product had entered into a storm water drain adjacent to the off load area at the station. Personnel from local fire department determined product had entered into a basin area immediately adjacent to the parking lot. Environmental response contractor was summoned to boom off and contain and product, storm drain and lines were drained with any free product removed by vac truck. Ditch line of the basin area was walked and any residual product was padded and removed. Containment booms were installed overnight to contain any residual product that have still existed in the storm water drain, lines, and basin area. On site activity was coordinated with communication of local OHEPA representative and it was determined that after a heavy rainfall event that occurred the evening of the next day that any residual product had been displaced and the cleanup activities were granted as complete.","Interviews with driver both during, and post the event, define that the cause of the error to be driver error. Driver admitted he basically failed to connect one of the product hoses (that run from connection to the unload heads on our trailer to the drop fittings used to connect and place product into the facility storage tank) that he got out of his normal routine while setting up to unload and thru his own inattention and failure to follow proper procedures cased the spill event to occur. As a note, the hoses and fittings were checked and found to be in normal condition.   Proper unloading procedures are incorporated into our driver safety/training manual in detail for the entire process. Each driver undergoes initial classroom training followed up by field training by a driver trainer. When any incident occurs it is reviewed in detail with the driver and a determination of cause is rendered. If deemed warranted, a driver will undergo re-training respective to the concerns presented by any incident in order to prevent recurrence of like incidents.
