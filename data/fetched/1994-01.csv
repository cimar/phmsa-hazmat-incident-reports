AFTER DISCUSSING FURTHER CLEANUP EFFORTS WITH YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL SUPERVISOR, MR. CLYDE WISEMAN, IT WAS DECIDED THAT REMOVING ANY REMAINING SULFUR WAS UNNECESSARY SINCE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND NATURE OF THE PRODUCT POSED NO HEALTH OR ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT. THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS A 3 INCH CLEAN OUT LINE AT THE TOP FRONT OF OUR SULFUR TRAILER. THE TRAILER HAD BEEN CLEANED AND PURGED FOR INTERNAL REPAIRS SEVERAL DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT AND THE CLEAN OUT CAP WAS INADVERTENTLY LEFT UNSCREWED AFTER REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED. OUR DRIVER FAILED TO NOTICE THE UNSCREWED CAP DURING HIS PRE-TRIP VEHICLE INSPECTION AND LOADED FOR A DELIVERY TO COLGATE-PALMOLIVE IN JEFFERSONVILLE, INDIANA. HE DROVE TO THE INTERSECTION OF ROUTE 4 AND INTERSTATE 64 BEFORE REALIZING AND CORRECTING THE PROBLEM. INITIAL REPORTS WERE THAT SULFUR HAD SPILLED AT TWO LOCATIONS INSIDE YOUR PLANT AND AT THE INTERSECTION OF RAND AVENUE AND ROUTE 111. AFTER FURTHER INVESTIAGION HOWEVRE, ADDITIONAL SPILLS WERE DISCOVERED AT THE INTERSTATE 70 EAST AND ROUTE 4 SOUTH OFF-RAMPS, AT THE INTERSECTION OF ROUTE 4 SOUTH AND ROUTE 50 WEST AND AT THE ROUTE 4 SOUTH AND INTERSTATE 64 EAST ON-RAMP. THE QUANTITY OF SULFUR SPILLED AT ALL LOCATIONS WAS ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN 10 GALLONS TOTAL.

PROPYLENE OXIDE IS A 302(A) EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE.  THE QUANTITY RELEASED WAS APPROXIMATELY 50 POUNDS.  THE INITIAL PHONE NOTIFICATION INDICATED A SPILL OF ABOUT 1200 POUNDS WHICH WAS BASED ON A LEAK WITH AN ESTIMATED OPENING BETWEEN THE GASKET AND THE FLANGE OF 1/32 OF AN INCH.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION AFTER THE INCIDENT WAS OVER THE ACTUAL GAP WAS TESTED WITH A 0.001 INCH FEELER GAUGE AND FOUND TO BE SMALLER WHICH RESULTED IN THE LOWER QUANTITY RELEASED.  THIS WAS ALSO CONFIRMED BY LATER DISCUSSIONS WITH PERSONNEL WHO RESPONDED TO THE LEAK.  THE RELEASE OCCURRED ABOUT 9:05 A.M. ON JANUARY 27, 1994 AND WAS STOPPED BY ABOUT 9:20 A.M. THE INCIDENT WAS FULLY TERMINATED AT 10:30 A.M.  WILL COUNTY EMA WAS NOTIFIED AT 9:15 A.M. WITH FOLLOW-UP CALLS AT 10:20 AND 11:00 A.M. ILLINOIS EMA WAS NOTIFIED AT 10:55 A.M. THE NRC WAS ALSO NOTIFIED.  THE LEAK OCCURRED BETWEEN TWO GASKETED FLANGES THAT WERE BOLTED TOGETHER BY STEPAN OPERATORS BEFORE UNLOADING THE PROPYLENE OXIDE FROM RAIL CAR UTLX 900762.  THE GASKET IS LOCATED BETWEEN A FLANGED FLEXIBLE SECTION OF PIPE AND THE FLANGE ON A SOLID SECTION OF PIPE WHICH IS THEN ATTACHED TO THE RAILCAR FLANGE.  THE LEAK OCCURRED ON THE GASKETED SECTION AWAY FROM THE RAIL CAR AND NOT THE FLANGE CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE RAIL CAR.  WHILE THE RELEASE WAS LIQUID THE MATERIAL HAS SOME VAPOR PRESSURE WHICH RESULTED IN PRECAUTIONARY ACTION OF CONTACTING THE RAILROADS AND STOPPING TRAFFIC ON THE MAIN LINE WHICH WAS DIRECTLY DOWNWIND ABOUT 100 FEET AWAY.  THE RELEASE WAS MITIGATED BY USE OF WATER SPRAYS WHICH REACT WITH THE CHEMICAL TO FORM PROPYLENE GLYCOL WHICH IS NOT HAZARDOUS.  THE RUNOFF WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE PROCESS DRAIN WHICH FLOWS TO AN ONSITE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT.  THE GROUND AREA UNDER THE RAIL CAR WAS COMPLETELY COVERED WITH ICE PRIOR TO THE SPILL DUE TO THE ICE STORM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT.  THIS RESULTED IN NO MATERIAL CONTACTING THE GROUND.  ACTIONS TAKEN TO RESPOND AND CONTAIN THE RELEASE INCLUDED THE OPERATORS DONING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND SHUTTING THE VALVE ON THE RAIL CAR BEFORE THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM ARRIVED ON THE SCENE.  ALSO, WATER WAS USED TO MITIGATE ANY VAPOR AND REDUCE THE HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL TO A NON-HAZARDOUS LIQUID.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR EVACUATIONS REQUIRED. DUE TO THE SMALL AMOUNT OF THE RELEASE THERE WERE NO KNOWN OR ANTICIPATED HEALTH RISKS TO THE PUBLIC.  PLANT PERSONNEL RESPONDING TO THE AREA OF THE LEAK WERE WEARING FULL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.  STEPAN EMPLOYEES APPROXIMATELY 400 PEOPLE AND THE SIC CODE FOR THIS OPERATION IS 2843.
