DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY 2002, A RESPONSE EFFORT WAS MADE TO LEAKING IM TANK GESU8008527 ON THE MSC VERONIQUE AT THE MAHER TERMINAL IN NEW JERSEY.  RESPONSE EFFORTS ENDED WITH THE SUCCESSFUL OFFLOADING OF THE TANK WITH NO PERSONAL INJURIES OR FURTHER SPILLAGE.  2.  ON THURSDAY, JUNE 27, THE VESSEL'S MASTER REPORTED THAT THE CREW HAD DETECTED A SMALL LEAK FROM  AN IM TANK CONTAINING HAZARDOUS MATERIAL STOWED ON DECK ON THE STARBOARD SIDE AT ABOUT THE MIDSHIPS POINT OF THE VESSEL.  THE TANK CONTAINED THE HAZMAT UN1143, ""CROTONALDEHYDE, STABILIZED"", WHICH IS POISONOUS BY INHALATION AND FLAMMABLE.  THE MSC VERONIQUE WAS ENROUTE FROM SOUTH AFRICA TO THE UNITED STATES.  NEW YORK WAS THE VESSEL'S FIRST SCHEDULED U.S. PORT OF CALL AND UPON LEARNING OF THE LEAK, THE U.S. COAST GUARD PROHIBITED ENTRY TO THE PORT UNTIL ASSURANCES COULD BE GIVEN THAT THE TANK OR ATMOSPHERE AROUND IT WAS NO LONGER DANGEROUS.  3.  AFTER RECEIVING THE INITIAL REPORT FROM THE MASTER, THE DANGEROUS GOODS DEPARTMENT IN ANTWERP WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY AND CONTACT THE SHIPPER SASOL CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES TO ADVISE OF THE SITUATION AND SEEK THE SHIPPER'S ASSURANCE OF TAKING ACTION AND FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.  THE VESSEL'S MASTER CREW LAUNCHED THE INITIAL RESPONSE WITH GREAT RESULTS AS THEY CONTROLLED THE DISCHARGE AND CONTAINED THE SPILL.  4.  ACCORDING TO MR. DIETER EHLS WITH BOWER LIQUID TRANSPORT, SPRING, TX, AGENT FOR THE SHIPPER, THE TANK APPARENTLY HAD BEEN OVERLOADED AT THE PORT OF LOADING AND THE CARGO EXPANDED WHEN THE SHIP CROSSED THE EQUATOR AND HEADED INTO WARMER, SUMMER TEMPERATURES.  THE CARGO WAS RELEASED THROUGH A PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE AT THE TOP OF THE TANK AND DRIPPED FROM A DRAINAGE LINE ONTO THE HATCH COVER AND DECK.  BECAUSE THE CONTAINMENT BOX COVERING THE VALVES AT THE TOP OF THE TANK WAS CLOSED, THERE WAS NO WAY TO SEE IF THE VALVE HAD RESET PROPERLY OR WAS PERMANENTLY DAMAGED SO AS TO CONTINUE LEAKING.  IN ADDITION, THERE WERE OTHER HAZARDOUS AND NON-HAZARDOUS CARGO CONTAINERS IN THE VICINITY.  DONNING APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT, THE CREW ATTACHED A HOSE TO THE END OF THE DRAIN PIPE AND LED IT INTO AN EMPTY OIL DRUM, PLACING THE HOSE INTO A BUNG HOLE AND STUFFING RAGS AROUND THE OPENING TO STOP THE VAPORS FROM SPREADING.  THE DRUM WAS LASHED IN PLACE TO PREVENT ITS MOVEMENT.  5.  THE SHIPPER IN SOUTH AFRICA ASSUMED FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RESPONSE EFFORT ON SATURDAY, JUNE 29, AND ASKED MSC FOR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLEANUP CONTRACTORS.  FORTUNATELY, A RESPONSE CONTRACTOR HAD ALREADY BEEN ALERTED IN CASE THE SHIPPER DID NOT OR WOULD NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY/  PETROCLEAN INC. (2 DORRINGTON RD., CARNEGIE, PENNSYLVANIA 15106) WAS CALLED IN TO RESPOND AT THE REQUEST OF THE SHIPPER. THEY WERE DIRECTED TO MEET THE VESSEL IN NEWARK, NJ.  THEY ARRIVED ON SCENE THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY EVENING, JULY 2, AND BOARDED THE VESSEL AT ANCHORAGE VIA SMALL BOAT.  PETROCLEAN HAD SUBCONTRACTED AN AIR-MONITORING TEAM FROM CTEH, INC. FROM ARKANSAS.

THE SPILL TECHNICIANS DID NOT SEE ANY MARKINGS OR LABELS ON THE OUTERMOST PACKAGING TO INDICATE THAT THE CONTENTS WERE A REGULATED MATERIAL AND THERE WASN'T A SHIPPER'S DECLARATION FOR DANGEROUS GOODS ATTACHED TO OR ACCOMPANYING THE SHIPMENT. THE TECHNICIANS ONLY FOUND AN AIR WAYBIL ATTACHED TO THE PACKAGE, BUT IT DID NOT INDICATE WHAT THE CONTENTS WERE.

HE THEN HOOKED UP THE VAPOR HOSE, OPENED HIS VALVES, STARTED INTERLINES PUMP AND BEGAN UNLOADING. WHEN TRAILER #357 WAS UNLOADED TO AROUND 50% THE TRAILER STOPPED UNLOADING. THE PLANT OPERATOR TOLD JOHNNY THAT BECAUSE OF THE VAPOR PRESSURES OF THIS PRODUCT,  HE WOULD HAVE TO USE HIS PUMP TO PUSH THE PRODUCT TO THE PLANT PUMP TO FINISH UNLOADING. AT THE START OF THE UNLOADING PROCESS OF TRAILER #357, THE VAPOR PRESSURE IN THE TRAILER WAS AROUND 200 PSI. AT THE TIME JOHNNY HAD TO HOOK UP TO THE TRAILER PUMP TO FINISH UNLOADING THE VAPOR PRESSURE HAD DROPPED TO ABOUT 160 PSI.  JOHNNY HOOKED UP THE SECOND HOSE ON THE RACK (THE LONGER OF THE TWO AND THE HOSE THAT FAILED ON THE  SECOND LOAD) TO HIS TRAILER PUMP OUTLET, CLOSED THE OUTLET AT THE REAR OF THE TRAILER, OPENED THE PUMP OUTLET ENGAGED THE TRAILER PUMP AND BEGAN UNLOADING.  WHILE JOHNNY  WAS UNLOADING AN INTERLINE OWNED TRUCK PULLED ALONG SIDE HIM, HOOKED UP TO THE PRESSURE BLOW DOWN HOSE (LOCATED ON THE SAME RACK AS THE  DISCHARGE HOSES BEING USED BY JOHNNY) AND PRESSURED DOWN HIS TRAILER (LPG), THEN PULLED OUT AND TO THE SCALES. JOHNNY FINISHED UNLOADING WITHOUT INCIDENT, UNHOOKED THE LIQUID HOSE AT THE REAR OF THE TRAILER, UNHOOKED THE LIQUID HOSE AT THE TRAILER""S PUMP, UNHOOKED THE VAPOR LINE AND PULLED AWAY FROM THE RACK-MADE A U-TURN AND PARKED HIS TRUCK AND TRAILER ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ABOUT 70 FEET FROM THE UNLOADING RACK. ALEX, IN TRUCK NUMBER 296, PULLING TRAILER NUMBER 524 BACKED INTO POSITION TO BEGIN UNLOADING AT THE RACK AND BEGAN TO HOOK UP TO THE LIQUID OUTLET AT THE REAR OF UNIT #524. JOHNNY LEFT HIS TRUCK, WALKED ACROSS  THE DRIVEWAY AND TOLD ALEX HE WOULD NEED TO USE HIS PUMP TO UNLOAD SO ALEX TOOK THE SHORTER OF THE TWO LIQUID HOSES AT THE RACK AND HOOKED IT TO THE LEFT SIDE OF TRAILER 524'S PUMP DISCHARGE. HE ALSO HANDED JOHNNY THE LONGER OF THE TWO HOSES (THE HOSE THAT FAILED) UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER. JOHNNY HOOKED THAT HOSE TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF TRAILER 534'S PUMP DISCHARGE AND OPENED THE INTERNAL VALVE AND THE GATE VALVES ON THE TRAILER AND SLOWLY OPENED THE VALVES ON THE END OF THE HOSES. ALEX HAD WALKED OVER TO INTERLINE'S PUMP AND PUSHED THE START BUTTON. AT THAT TIME, THE COUPLING THAT JOHNNY HOOKED UP FAILED AND THE HOSE BLEW OFF, HITTING JOHNNY ON THE ARM AND ALLOWING LIQUID FROM THE PUMP PIPING AND THE HOSES TO ESCAPE TO ATMOSPHERE.  THE HOSE WHIPPED AROUND AND BACK UNDERNEATH THE TRAILER, THE HOSE ON THE LEFT SIDE REMAINED HOOKED. THE LIQUID GAS SPEWED THROUGH THE PUMP PIPING, CONTAMINATING JOHNNY'S CLOTHING, AND SHOT ACROSS THE DRIVEWAY TO JOHNNY'S PARKED TRUCK #245 AND AT SOME POINT IGNITED, CATCHING UNIT 245 ON FIRE.
