ON APRIL 24,2001, THE INITIAL TRANSPORTER TRIAD, INC., TRAILER#: 3112 WAS STAGED AT THE RECEIVING BAYS (SEE ATTACHED FACILITY DIAGRAM) OF ENSCO WEST INC, 1737 EAST DENNI ST., WILMINGTON, CA 90744.

EWI SUBSEQUENTLY SIGNED OFF ON THE  MANIFEST AS THE SECONDARY TRANSPORTER, TAKING POSSESSION OF THE WASTE, AND PROCEEDED TO OFF-LOAD THE PACKAGES. UPON ENTERING THE TRAILER, IT WAS NOTICED BY ONE OF THE WAREHOUSE OPERATORS THAT TWO CUBIC YARD SACKS APPARENTLY LEAKED MATERIAL ONTO THE FLOOR'S LINER (SEE MANIFEST AND PICTURE ENCLOSED). ONE SACK HAD SMALL HOLES NEAR ITS BASE AND THE OTHER WAS MOUNTED TO ITS PALLET ON ITS SIDE, CAUSING LIQUID TO SPILL FROM THE OPENING OF THE INNER LINING. THE OPERATIONS MANAGER WAS NOTIFIED AND INSTRUCTED THE WAREHOUSE OPERATOR TO CLEAN UP THE SPILLED MATERIAL AND REPACKAGE THE CUBIC YARD SACKS. THE WAREHOUSE OPERATOR IMMEDIATELY DONNED THE PROPER LEVEL OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND PROCEEDED TO REPACKAGE THE TWO SACKS. THE LINER OF THE TRAILER WAS WIPED CLEAN OF THE SPILLED MATERIALS AND ALL SPILL RESPONSE MEDIA WAS DISPOSED OF AS WASTE. APPROXIMATELY 10-12 OUNCES OF MATERIAL SPILLED FROM THE TWO BAGS ONTO THE TRAILER'S FLOOR LINER. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TWO SACKS LEAKED DURING TRANSIT TO OUR DISPOSAL FACILITY.  BASED ON THE INTEGRITY OF THE PACKAGES AND THE FACT THAT ONE PACKAGE WAS MOUNTED IMPROPERLY TO ITS PALLET (SEE PICTURE), ENSCO WEST, INC.

THE GAUGE ON THE TANK READ EMPTY AND AFTER DISCHARGING THE FUEL NOZZLE, THE DRIVER RETURNED TO THE TRUCK TO GET A SECOND HOSE.  AS HE WAS AT THE TRUCK, THE TANK BEGAN TO OVERFILL.  WHEN THE DRIVER RETURNED TO OUR YARD, WE TOPPED OFF HIS FUEL TANK WITH APPROX 10 GALLONS.  TO BEGIN, OUR FUELING PROCEDURES STATE THAT THE DRIVER SHOULD NEVER WALK AWAY FROM A NOZZLE THAT IS DISCHARGING FUEL.  OUR DRIVER DID NOT COMPLY WITH THOSE PROCEDURES AND WAS THE CAUSE OF THE FUEL SPILL.  HOWEVER, WE ARE EQUIPPED TO HANDLE SPILLS OF THIS NATURE AND ALL OF OUR TRUCKS ARE EQUIPPED WITH SPILL CONTAINMENT MATERIAL.  IF THE SPILL HAD REMAINED IN THE CONTAINMENT AREA OF THE FUEL TANK ROOM, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATELY RECTIFIED.  THE FUEL SPILL PROBLEM WAS EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THAT A HOLE HAD BEEN DRILLED IN THE CONTAINMENT ROOM THROUGH TO THE PARKING GARAGE AND EVIDENTLY INTO SOME STORAGE SPACES AS WELL AS THE SUMP/DRAIN AREA  I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS WAS DONE BY CSI AS PART OF THE INSTALLATION OR BY CRESCENT REAL ESTATE AFTER THE INSTALLATION WAS COMPLETE.

CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. DUE TO THE ODOR IN THE BUILDING, THE FACILITY MANAGER ALSO SUSPENDED WORK IN THE AREA AND EVACUATED HIS EMPLOYEES TO ANOTHER AREA.  GIVEN ALL OF THE DATA AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, IT WAS BELIEVED THAT A SHIPMENT OF RESIN SOLUTION WAS LEAKING.  CARRIER'S HAZMAT SPECIALIST CONTACTED A SPILL CONTRACTOR FOR  A RESPONSE.  AFTER BEING NOTIFIED VIA CHEMTREC, THE SHIPPER OF THE RESIN SOLUTION FAXED AN M.S.D.S. FOR THEIR PRODUCT.  THE CONTRACTOR ARRIVED, AND BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION, DETERMINED THAT ENTRY ON SUPPLIED AIR WOULD BE NEEDED. AFTER UNLOADING MUCH OF THE LOAD, A DRUM OF INK WAS FOUND WITH A HOLE IN ITS BOTTOM THERE WAS NO CORRESPONDING CAUSE.  INK HAD RUN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE TRAILER, WITH  SOME HAVING SPLASHED ONTO OTHER SHIPMENTS.  THE CONTRACTOR SPREAD OIL DRY ONTO THE TRAILER FLOOR TO ABSORB THE FREE LIQUIDS.  THEY OVERPACKED THE DAMAGED DRUM AND TIGHTENED THE VENT BUNG ON ONE OTHER DRUM.  AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE CARRIER IT WAS DECIDED TO TAKE THE TRAILER TO THE CONTRACTOR'S FACILITY AND PARK IT THERE FOR THE NIGHT WITH DOORS OPEN. THE CONTRACTOR SPREAD PLASTIC FILM UNDER THE TRAILER AND WATCHED FOR ADDITIONAL LEAKAGE.  THE DRIVER CALLED THE NEXT DAY TO REPORT THAT HE HAD DROPPED THE TRAILER AT THE CONTRACTOR'S FACILITY AS PLANNED AND HAD GONE TO A NEARBY TRUCK STOP FOR THE NIGHT.  HE RETURNED TO FIND THAT A SMALL QUANTITY OF DRIPPED OUT OF THE TRAILER AND ONTO THE SHEETING, BUT IT APPEARS TO HAVE STOPPED. AFTER DISCUSSION WITH THE CARRIER'S HAZMAT SPECIALIST IT WAS DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE SAFE TO CONTINUE THE TRAILER TO A NEARBY FACILITY OF THE CARRIER IT WAS UNLOADED THERE AND SURVEYED.

AT THAT TIME THE DRIVER STATED THAT THE TRUCK STARTED TO SLIDE ALMOST AS IF ITS WERE DRIVING ON ICE.  THE TRUCK SLID SIDEWAYS AND HIT A SERIES OF BAD RUTS IN THE ROAD.

THE TRUCK OVERTURNED COMING TO REST ON ITS TOP. ON 04/16/2001 OUR DRIVER, MR. JAMES DRIVER WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 25MPH ALONG CURTIS AVENUE AT PENNINGTON AVENUE IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND.  MR. DRIVER STATED THAT HE APPLIED THE BRAKES ATTEMPTING TO SLOW THE VEHICLE PRIOR TO ENTERING A SHARP CURVE IN THE ROAD.  WHEN HE BEGAN BRAKING, THE TRUCK STARTED TO SLIDE SIDEWAYS ON THE ROAD MADE RECENTLY SLIPPERY BY A MISTING RAIN THAT WAS FALLING THAT MORNING.  IT WAS LATER LEARNED THAT ROAD WAS ALSO SLICK WITH HEATING OIL THAT SPILLED OFF OF THE TOPS OF HEATING OIL TRUCKS THAT LOAD AT THE TERMINAL ACCESSED BY THIS ROAD. THE TRUCK NOW SLIDING SIDEWAYS, HIT A SERIES OF RUTS IN THE ROAD SURFACE (ALSO CAUSED BY THE UNUSUALLY HEAVY TRUCK TRAFFIC).  UPON HITTING THE RUTS THE TRUCK ROLLED OVER ON ITS PASSENGER SIDE FINALLY COMING TO REST ON THE TOP OF THE CAB AND TANKS.  THE DRIVER TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND CLIMBED OUT OF THE TRUCK, IMMEDIATELY NOTIFYING OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL OF THE INCIDENT.  THE DRIVER REPORTED TO OUR EMERGENCY STAFF THAT WHEN THE TRUCK HAD ROLLED ON TOP OF THE TANKS, A VALVE ON TOP OF THE TANK WAS BROKEN OFF, CAUSING THE PRODUCT TO SPILL AT A VERY SLOW RATE ON TO THE GROUND. OUR EMERGENCY STAFF OF 5 PEOPLE WENT TO THE SCENE TO ASSIST IN THE CLEAN UP AND RIGHTING OF OUR DAMAGED TRUCK.  UPON REACHING THE SCENE IT WAS DETERMINED BY OUR STAFF THAT THE CLEAN UP TIME WOULD BE GREATLY REDUCED IF WE HIRED AN OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR TO VACUUM UP THE SPILLED SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE.  THE NEAREST CONTRACTOR ON OUR APPROVED CONTRACTORS LIST WAS DISPATCHED.  A TRUCK TOWING COMPANY WAS DISPATCHED BY OUR STAFF WHILE EN-ROUTE.  THE CLEAN UP CONTRACTOR ARRIVED WITH A VACUUM TRUCK AND QUICKLY BEGAN TO SUCK UP THE SPILLED PRODUCT.  AFTER THE CONTRACTOR FINISHED, THE TRUCK WAS RIGHTED BY OUR TOW COMPANY AND OUR EMERGENCY STAFF MADE A FINAL SWEEP THROUGH THE SCENE TO GATHER UP INFORMATION FOR LATER USE AT OUR HAZMAT TRAINING SESSIONS. THE CONTRACTOR  HAULED THE CLEANED UP PRODUCT BACK TO HOLDING TANKS AT AMATO TO BE TESTED AND PUMPED BACK INTO OUR STORAGE TANKS. THE SPILLED PRODUCT WAS COMPLETELY RECOVERED, THEREFORE NO HAZARDOUS WASTE MANIFEST WAS NECESSARY, AND NO DISPOSAL WAS NECESSARY.
