The driver was at Rectorseal's dock.  He worked with Rectorseal’s receiving clerk to place absorbent on the pavement where the product was leaking in order to contain it. Hulcher Environmental Services was contacted for dispatch of a crew to the site for cleanup. Hulcher was on site at approximately 12:05pm and began cleanup.  The leaking drum was on a pallet in the left front of the trailer.  There was a stack of pallets loaded to the right side of this pallet for dunnage.  The loader had left a gap between the two pallets and the drum appeared to have “walked” to the edge of the pallet. Once it reached the edge of the pallet there was enough of a gap to allow the drum to tip.  When it tipped it struck the pallet behind it.  The pallet behind it had 2 nails sticking up. The drum was punctured by one of these nails.  All of the material was contained.  The other pallets on the trailer, and the trailer were decontaminated on site by Hulcher.  The leaking drum was placed into an overpack drum, and there were 3 drums of absorbent, PPE, paper etc generated during the cleanup.  All of these drums will be disposed of through Univar's Chemcare waste disposal services.    I inspected the pavement on the route the driver took into the customer.  EDTA turns a whitish color when it is exposed to air and dries.  Any spillage onto the pavement would have been fairly easy to detect.  Since there was no sign of spillage on the pavement on the customer’s property, nor on the street near the entrance it is assumed the drum must have tipped as the driver turned into the customer’s driveway.    The cleanup job was completed at 3:40pm.. I spoke with representatives of Rectorseal to confirm they were satisfied with the cleanup.  They agreed everything was taken care of to their satisfaction.  The trailer was brought back to Univar's Brisbane St yard and unloaded.  The trailer was then sent to Service Transport for thorough decontamination.","Both the Dallas and Houston Univar operations managers will review this incident with all warehouse personnel.  We will reiterate our process for utilizing proper and acceptable pallets for palletizing drums, which incompasses performing a thorough inspection of the pallet to identify any broken boards and/or protruding nails and remediate. We will also review proper load bracing with loading personnel and drivers.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Non-removable head plastic drum,1H1,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1858,Univar USA Inc,US,

During the course of the trip, the vehicle made a routine stop at a Clean Harbor's in-transit storage location.  During a routine inspection at this location, it was discovered that a small amount of liquid was dripping from the van trailer.  Facility personnel immediately notified local managment and an emergecny reposne crew was assembled.  After surveying the trailer and donning appropriate personnel protective equipment, it was discovered that a 55 gallon container had a split in the seamof the drum allowing approximately 10 gallons of material to leak onto the trailer floor. The damaged container was placed into a suitable salvage container and the material released to the trailers floor was absorbed using a suitable absorbent material.  The clean-up debris along with the samll amount of gravel impacted under the trailer and the material used to decontaminate the trailer floor was placed into the salvage drum which was subsequently sent for disposal to the intended waste management facility.      While the spill respone was in progress, the State Agency responsible for the oversight of licensed hazardous waste transporters was mtofied on the incident and the steps taken to address the release.","TAT the time the container was accepted for transprtation, no evidence of leaking, damage or overpressurization was observed.  It is believed that during transportation and storage, the container overpressurized allowing the seam to split.  It is believed that sufficient head space was not left in the container to allow for normal expansion of material during the rigors of transportation.

During the course of the trip, the driver made a routine stop a a Clean Harbor's in transit storage location for the purpose of consolidating less than truckload quantities of containers onto a single vehicle for continuing transportation.  As the personnel responsible for transfering the containers iniittaed the operation, it was discovered that a 55 gallon container had tipped onto its side during transportation.  When the container was placed in an upright position, material escaped from the package onto the floor of the van trailer. An emergency response team donned the appropriate personal protctive equipment and initiated response activities.  The damaged container was placed into a suitable salvage drum along with all material used to both contain and absorb all freee liquids and the material used to decontaminate the trailer floor.  Once secured, the container was placed into an alternate vehicle for continued transportation to the intended waste management facility.","A review f the incident concluded that inadequate blocking and bracing was deploted to secure the drum in question.

As he walked around the trailer he noticed smoke / vapors coming from the dome lid of the trailer.  We immediately notified the fire department who dispatched a team to the scene.  Driver evacuated drivers around the vacinity and stayed up wind.  Fire department was able to establish that there was a problem with the gasket that allowed moisture from rain the night before to get in the space between the gasket and dome lid.  Fuming sulfuric reacts with water which caused the visible reaction and off-spout of poisonous gas.  From there we called in our emergency response team who was able to install a new gasket.  The original gasket was not the correct one that should have been in the trailer.  It requires a Viton B gasket and a braided teflon rope gasket was what was in the trailer.  Once the correct gasket was installed the situation was rectified.,"Our safety department was not given adeqaute time, notification, communication to review this last minute exotic commodity (fuming sulfuric acid).  Our safety team plays an intregal role in ensuring safety for every new chemical we move.  Several things can occur as a result of last minute planning such as utilizing wrong equipment or improperly trained/briefed drivers.  In this case the gaskets in the dome lid of the trailer were the wrong type.  We have discussed with leadership that the usual/correct process was not followed and a a costly evacuation (thankfully without injuries) and clean up occurred as a result.  Leadership agree's and has reviewed this process with all leaders and associates relavant in making haul/no haul decisions.",No,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,15000,Schneider National Bulk Carriers,US,

Security personnel followed the trail to the truck which was parked by the scale.  The driver was asked about spilled liquid and he said that his fuel cap was loose and caused diesel fuel to leak out onto the ground.  The driver maintained that the cap had been tampered with at another location prior to arriving at IMTT.  The driver secured the fuel cap and cleaned the outside of his fuel tank.  IMTT-Security personnel contacted IMTT Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) personnel to assess the situation.  The IMTT Environmmental Compliance Manager contacted EQ-Terminal Services to respond to the area and clean up the spilled fuel on the roadway.

The contaminated rinse water ran into the sump tank at the facility, which is designed to catch runoff and waste water.  No further cleanup was required.

Upon further investigation it was discovered that the product was leaking from the manway cover.  The car was set out to track 210 and the Care of Party (Houston Fuel Oil Terminal) and Freight Bill Party (Tauber Oil Co) were notified of the condition of the car.  Houston Fuel Oil initially stated that Tauber would clean the car and determine the cause of the leak. Eventually, on Thursday 7/30 at approximately 1600 hrs Houston Fuel Oil notified the PTRA that they would send Oil Mop, Inc over to clean the car on Friday, July 31 in the early AM.  Oil Mop arrived on scene at approximately 0845 Friday and began to wipe down the product on the hand rails, ladders and side of the tank car. They determined that the shipper, Suncor Energy, failed to install a gasket on the manway allowing product to slosh out of the tank car when moved.  Approximately two gallons of product was spilled down the sides and on top of the car. Oil Mop, Inc completed the remediation and cleared the scene at 1023 hrs.",Houston Fuel Oil Terminal and Tauber will be contacting the shipper to investigate the matter further.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111A,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1000,Port Terminal Railroad Association,US,

Further inspection verified the Salco 'Quick Inspect Safety Vent' was not equipped with the recommended surge suppression device.  A Dupont response team from New Johnsonville, TN responded, arriving on 7/10/2009 to inspect the car and installed a new rupture disk and assembly . Railcar Services then performed a leak test and SWS, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene on 07/10/2009 to decontaminate the car before released for transport.

A receptacle was placed under AGLX 1119 to catch drippage. Dripping product that impacted the ground and captured in the catch receptacles evaporated. Additional inspection of AGLX 1119 could not determine the leak source that emanated from under the tank car jacketing and dripped out near the front of the B-end body bolster adjacent to the number one wheel. It was also noted that the B-end lower jacketing was slightly buckled on both the right and left sides. Arrangements were made to transfer the remaining product within AGLX 1119 to another suitable tank car and this was accomplished on 7/14/09 without further incident.

The air compressor was then immediately shut down and the air lines were bled.  30 gallons of product escaped the railcar; 20 gallons of which was captured in the track pan while 10 gallons contacted the ballast between tracks 12 and 13.  The product was neutralized using bicarbonate, per the MSDS, then cleaned up and placed in a 55 gallon drum.  The drum was labeled awaiting disposal.  After investigation it was determined that: 1. The loader over-tightened the bolts on the reducer and caused the valve assembly to become off center. 2. Teflon lined flange had small cracks and chips around the outer edge due to the continuous raising and lowering of fittings from the tops of railcars to the ballast below.","1. Terminal is purchasing additional valve assemblies in 2” and 3” sizes to minimize the need to attach and detach fittings to accommodate the various sized railcar valves.  2. Retraining employees on the proper technique of uniformly using the star pattern when bolting fittings to railcars and on the importance of not over-tightening the first bolt when doing so.   3. As part of daily equipment inspection, the Teflon lining of all chemical fittings will be inspected to ensure there are no defects in the lining itself.    4. Terminal is purchasing rubberized caps to place on the bottom of valve assemblies to further prevent premature wear of Teflon lining when lowering fittings to the ballast below.",No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,KMMS/TRANSFLO,US,

PPGX 1804 was immediately cordoned off, yard operations ceased and employees were moved away from the area to the opposite end of the railyard. Contract responders were summoned to eliminate the odor source and initiate air monitoring. The responders removed the intact seal numbered PPG 07177 from the valve protective housing cover for valve inspection. The responders found the A-end liquid valve slightly open with its closure plug not applied. This valve was immediately closed. The threads on the one inch plug were cleaned; the plug was installed and tool tightened. Product odor detection ended after securement was completed by 1017 hrs. CDT, 7/15/09. This was confirmed by air monitoring samplings. Afterwards, PPGX 1804 was moved to a remote area in the railyard for the responders to decontaminate any impacted surfaces around the valve housing area.

SWS, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and found product leaking from where the bottom outlet valve connects to the tank car around the bolts. SWS personnel contained the leak and transferred the product into tank car ETCX 222645. While performing the transfer, SWS representatives tightened several bolts that were loose on the manway cover plate. Upon finishing the transload of product, SWS personnel found that the bottom outlet flapper valve was in the open position, while the handle was in the closed position. This incident did require a special switching move.     NARRI: 2(5+1+0) X (2+0) = 24  Cause Code: 551","The contents of the car was transferred to another rail car and a FRA movement approval was filed for.

The source of the odor was initially thought to be from a loaded tank car of Methyl Mercaptan, PSPX 22128. Switching operations were suspended and impacted crews were sheltered inside the yard office. BNSF contract responders were called to investigate and eliminate the odor source. Responders reported PSPX 22162 (DOT 105J500W tank car) was found to be the odor source. Responder's detection equipment registered product vapor at the pressure plate flange of PSPX 22162.

The conductor reported that while switching the A-Track he noticed a tank car sloshing some liquid out of the top and the sides of the car were wet.  Also, he noticed that small amounts of liquid were dripping off of the bottom of the car into the middle of the track.  The conductor stated that the liquid was only sloshing out of the top when the car was being moved.  The A-Track paralles a stream and once it was determined that there was no danger of the liquid entering the stream and moving the car would cause more liquid to leak that leaving the car where it sat was the best option.  The car was a tank car with # GAMX 5577, UN 1824, Sodium Hydroxide Solution.  Leaving the car sit at this location posed no danger to employees, the public or environment.    Haz-Mat and environmental response company Specialized Professional Services, Inc. (SPSI) was called to assess and remidiate the situation.  They found that the tank car was leaking small amounts of liquid due to a broken rupture disk.  SPSI neatraulized the track area where liquid leaked and wiped and neautralized the sides of the car.  They then replaced the rupture disk and cleared the car for spotting and subsequent unloading.      The total amount of time the car was leaking is unknown.  At least 2 other crews switched the A-Track in the prior 24 hours before the car was found leaking and neither crew saw anything abnormal with this car.  It is suspected that while the JB-2 was switching the A-Track the rupture disk broke due to several large sloshes of the liquid in the tank car.  If this is when the rupture disk broke then total amout of time the leak would have occurred would have been approximately 6 hours.","All crews on the BPRR are being contacted to refresh them on checking haz-mat cars for potential leaks and procedures to be followed if anything is found. Also, the importance of handling haz-mat cars with care is being addressed.    It is unknown if the rupture disk was defective although the car owner was notified to throulghy check all valves, fittings, gaskets etc..  before reloading cars.",No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,5000,BUFFALO & PITTSBURGH RR,US,

During the course of the trip, the driver conducted a routine load check and identified  material leaking from the trailer onto the parking area of the truck stop.  The driver immediately place an absorbent material down to absorb the free liquid and prevent the spread of the release.  Once secured, he notified his home dispatcher and the manager of the fueling facility where the vehicle was parked.  The Blacksburg Fire Department was called as was a local emergency response company.  Upon arrival the emergency response team inspected the trailer and determined that it was secured pending the arrival of a Clean Harbor's Emergency Response Team. Upon arrival of Clean Harbor's personnel, the team, utilizing appropriate personal protective equipment, entered the trailer and initiated the removal of containers in order to identify the leaking container.  It was discovered that 2 separate 55 gallon drums were leaking from the bottom seam.  The crew placed the leaking containers into a suitable over pack and proceeded to absorb and collect all free liquids.  This material was placed into the salvage drums along with all materials used to decontaminate the trailer floor.  In addition, the absorbent used to collect the material that escaped from the trailer was collected and this to was placed into the salvage drums for disposal.  Once the clean up was complete, the trailer was reloaded and was sent on to the intended waste management facility where the shipment was received and processed for disposal.","AT the time the containers were accepted for transporttion, no evidence of leaking was observed.  It is believed that the corrosion identified on the bottom seam of the container failed during the course of transportation allowing the material to leak from the container.  In order to prevent a recurrence, the individuals that offered the shipment for transportation and the driver in posession of the shipment have been re instructed to ensure that each drum is inspected before it is accepted for transportation.

During the tranfer operation, the fork-lift operator allowed the pallet he was moving to contact the side wall of the trailer.  This contact allowed one 55 gallon drum to fall from the pallet which cause the lid to dislodge.

Operations were ceased and yard crews were sheltered inside the yard office complex.  A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder immediately inspected CELX 6421 and reported no product odor present at or around CELX 6421. Further inspection revealed a slight product stain at the manway nozzle. The responder checked the securement of the ten manway securement bolt nuts and found several of these not tool tight.  The loose bolt nuts were tool tightened. A nearby BNSF hazardous material contractor was also called to respond. The contract responders reported finding all valves closed and secure. They also reported finding zero gauged internal pressure within CELX 6421. The manway cover was opened to check the product outage level and the manway gasket condition. The product outage was deemed appropriate. A portion of the manway gasket was observed hanging inside the manway nozzle and this gasket appeared in good condition. Since the manway gasket was misaligned or not fully seated; it was concluded that this condition along with the loose manway securement bolt nuts prevented a good manway closure seal. The manway gasket was correctly repositioned and the manway lid was closed and properly secured prior to 0700 hrs. CDT, 7/31/09. Intact seals numbered 5191439 and 5191432 were removed; replaced by seals numbered 2877021 and 2877022. Yard operations resumed after an approximate three hour outage. No further incidents were reported during subsequent rail movements of CELX 6421.    The specification stencil on CELX 6421 indicated that it was built 6/1968 and its last tank qualification was completed in the year 2008 and next due in 2018.   One BNSF employee whom was a member of the crew that reported the product odor was treated at a local hospital for inhalation exposure and released.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,ZZ,ZZ,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,900,BNSF Railway Company,US,

BNSF and contract hazardous material responders inspected UTLX 200043 and found it secure. Additional rail car inspections in the railyard were initiated to locate the odor source. The contract responders using a PID (photo-ionization detector) reported finding UTLX 25353 (DOT 111A60W1 tank car) as the odor source. Detailed inspection of UTLX 25353 revealed that the vacuum relief valve (VRV) or vacuum breaker was the source point of the odor. The VRV's stem bottom pressure seal (o-ring) appeared displaced. The VRV was covered and sealed with nitrile material and UTLX 25353 was isolated in the railyard. The contract responders returned the morning of 7/27/09 to remove the VRV and install a steel plug in the vacated VRV orifice. After the VRV plug was secured, the responders found no readings from their PID device at or near UTLX 25353.

PLMX 30120 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard. No product impacted the ground and the spillage on the side shell was evaporating. BNSF and contract hazardous material responders inspected PLMX 30120 and determined the product release source was at the 75 psi pressure relief device (PRD). A detailed inspection of the PRD revealed that the PRD bottom stem had broken off, releasing the spring assembly which was missing. The responders acquired a replacement 75 psi PRD and installed it. The replacement PRD had a SCFM air flow rate slightly less that its predecessor PRD and since no required leakproof test was completed after the new PRD was installed; a FRA Movement Approval FRA-09080330 was granted to move PLMX 30120 in rail transportation to the consignee to be unloaded.

BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responders reported that the product spillage emanated from the pressure relief device (PRD). BNSF contract responders were summoned to check the product outage level and clean the product spill from the shell of TCIX 16035. Contract responders reported that the product outage level appeared to be appropriate. The spillage on the shell of TCIX 16035 was neutralized and wiped clean on 7/21/09. The suspected cause of this liquid product release from the PRD was attributed to a hydraulic pressure surge from movement.  The specification stencil on TCIX 16035 indicated that the last tank qualification was completed in the year 2000 and next due in 2010; and the 75 psi Safety Valve (PRD) was tested in 2007.,No additional comments.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1010,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Inspection developed the lading to be a total of 80 drums, double stacked, in a twenty foot container.  The drums were secured with Ty-Gard, which was improperly applied, allowing the material to sag.  While removing the drums, located one floor loaded drum near the rear doors, that had a two inch side wall stress crack, directly above the bottom chime. The bottom chime on the opposite side of the drum, was deformed and bent upwards, indicating the drum impacted an adjacent drum during the loading process.  Estimated 6 gallons of product released.  The drum was patched and placed into a salvage drum for securement.  Near the nose of the container, on the second tier of drums, located a drum that had a slight dent on the bottom chime, that allowed product to weep through the chime.  It appears the drum chime abraded an adjacent drum during transit.  Less than one gallon of product was released.  The drum was patched and placed into a salvage drum for securement.  Two additional drums were found to have sufficient damge to warrent them unfit for further transport, and were placed into salvage drums for securement.  The container flooring was cleaned of the residue, and the remaining drums were placed back into the original container.  The lading was properly secured for movement to the port for vessel  loading.

Inspection of the area revealed a green-tinted liquid had run out of the car after it had been jacked up. Inspection of the inside of the car failed to identify a source for the liquid; however, the bulkheads securing the load in each end of the car had failed, allowing the load to shift. Mr. Sekavec made contact with the shipper to advise them of the incident and the condition of the car. Shipper advised the car would be transloaded on August 10th and the contents would be inspected then. On August 10th and 11th, the car was partially unloaded, contents inspected with no source of a release found, and then reloaded and secured. The liquid that had been released the night of the original incident had been absorbed with clay absorbent and placed into buckets. The buckets were placed with the original shipment for disposal at destination. During the reloading, 77 drums of materials other than those originally billed were found, necessitating additions to the shipping paperwork. Following securement and the required paperwork corrections, the car was released to continue in transportation.

The driver went over a section of highway that was being paved and the tank failed in front of the middle hatch area. The metal on top of the tank failed causing the tank to buckle. The leak occurred at the top of the tank and continued until the liquid level in the tank got below the failed section.   After the driver realized what had transpired, he found a safe area to pull over, deployed his spill kit and called 911 to initiate a response. Local fire, hazmat and response teams where mobilized and a plan of action was determined to off load the remaining contents of the tank into another tanker. The product was then returned to the shipper for storage.   It is still unclear why the tank failed and we are still investigating why the failure occurred. Pictures are attached.

The gasoline and diesel fuel spilled from the trailer, catching fire and burning our truck/trailer, a Meijers truck. trailer and also the car that caused the crash. As a result of the fire, the bridge that carries 9 Mile Rd. traffic collasped. There were no serious injuries and no fatalities. Police and fire crews were called to the scene to fight the fire and to direct traffic away from the accident. At that time the Michigan Sate Police took charge of the accident scene. The fire lasted for several hours. There was not enough of the trailer left to really tell which part of the unit failed first letting the gas and diesel to spill.

While he was traveling on US 460 to his first stop, he observed a group of cars coming towards him. He noticed one car starting to drift toward the center line. Steve does not know if the car crossed over the line.  Steve moved to the right and his tire went off the edge of the road. Steve took his foot off of the gas, did not brake, and tried to keep his truck going straight till he could ease it back onto the road. Steve’s tire hit a concrete culvert and at this point he lost control of his vehicle. The tractor and trailer went to his left, onto the road and ended up on its side completely across the road.  The driver of the jeep struck Steve head on and came to a rest on the grass. She was taken by ambulance for observation and was later released.  A car, traveling in the same lane, behind Steve ran off the road. The driver, of the vehicle following our vehicle, told Steve he had to run off the road to avoid hitting him.  Several people stopped to check on Steve and the woman. Steve was able to get out of the vehicle and he called the office and spoke with his direct Supervisor, Preston Porter,  Local police, Fire, EMT’s and the Scott county Hazmat team were sent to the scene.  Brenntag sent Preston Porter and Jeff Brown to the Scene.  They were later joined by:  Ken Jones V.P. Operations  Bob McCutchan Indy District Operations Mgr,  Chris Dawson Georgetown Distribution Center Mgr.  Responders arrived on the Scene shortly after 8:00 and clean up was done by 10:30 pm. In the course of that time the following was done:  Steve was taken from the scene; drug tested, and checked over by a Physicians Assistant at Georgetown Worxs.  The driver of the jeep bad to be cut out of car due to the door being jammed. She walked to the ambulance, where she was taken to the hospital. I was later told she had minor injuries and was released.    The Fire Department, Homeland Security Director, Scott County Hazmat team, and Brenntag Mid-South, Inc. worked together to: establish a safe perimeter; determine the best way to clean up the spilled material; remove the non spilled material, and the damaged vehicles.  Evergreen Environmental was called in to handle the clean up  A 3 mile section of 460 was closed, from Centerville road to Newton Pike.  The initial perimeter was several hundred yards away but KU reported a spark at their sub-station, located adjacent to the scene of the accident, so the perimeter was moved out to approximately 1/2 mile.  (The trailer had struck a small portion of the fence and KU came out and replaced this)  At approximately 4:00 p.m. Evergreen and Brenntag started the process of removing the damaged material, good material, and damaged vehicles.  At approximately 10:30 Evergreen finished cleaning the site and the road was open to traffic.  Evergreen came back to the site the following day to fill in the holes on the side of the road. They ha",1) WE SENT OUT A SAFETY ALERT TO ALL PERSONNEL ON THE DATE OF THE INCIDENT TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE.   2) WE HAVE EVALUATED THE FACTORS INVOLVED SUCH AS A TWO-LANE ROAD WITH LIMIITED SHOULDER FOR AVOIDING ACCIDENTS.  WE ARE LOOKING AT REROUTING OUR TRUCK DELIVERIES IN THIS AREA.  3) WE WERE PLEASED WITH HOW WELL THE PACKAGING SURVIVED THE VEHICLE CRASH.  WE WILL CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE LOAD SECUREMENT MEETS DOT REQUIREMENTS DURING INITIAL AND RECCURENT TRAINING.

Steve took his foot off of the gas, did not brake, and tried to keep his truck going straight till he could ease it back onto the road. Steve’s tire hit a concrete culvert and at this point he lost control of his vehicle. The tractor and trailer went to his left, onto the road and ended up on its side completely across the road.  The driver of the jeep struck Steve head on and came to a rest on the grass. She was taken by ambulance for observation and was later released.  A car, traveling in the same lane, behind Steve ran off the road. The driver, of the vehicle following our vehicle, told Steve he had to run off the road to avoid hitting him.  Several people stopped to check on Steve and the woman. Steve was able to get out of the vehicle and he called the office and spoke with his direct Supervisor, Preston Porter,  Local police, Fire, EMT’s and the Scott county Hazmat team were sent to the scene.

Highland Ave,JOHNSON,KS,67855,Shipper,"On 07-23-09 at about 4:30 pm I received a call in reference to a traffic accident that occurred at 3:57pm 9 miles south of Johnson Ks. on Hwy 27. According to Guy and Justin, Todd Gasseling, was driving his 2008 Ford Pickup Unit #221 south on Hwy 27 pulling one nurse tank #81 when he either blew a front tire or lost a front wheel on the nurse tank trailer causing the trailer and pickup to roll over. The tank was separated from the trailer and during the accident the valves were broken off causing an anhydrous ammonia release. The nurse tank is a 1000-gallon vessel filled to 85%. When the broken valves were plugged there was less than 10% left in the tank. This would mean that about 750 gallons or 3862 lbs were released into the atmosphere. By the time I learned of the accident, Justin Ochs was already making the necessary spill reporting calls, David and Guy were on scene as was the Sheriff Dept and LEPC.    The next day I inspected the truck at the Sheriff’s impound and spoke to the officer that worked the accident. He stated that Todd was traveling south on Hwy 27 about 9 miles south when he lost the right front wheel on the NH3 trailer. Todd told him that he was driving at about 55mph when the accident happened. The loss of the wheel caused the truck and trailer to pull towards the ditch and when it reached the ditch the trailer and truck both rolled over. At some point during the accident the NH3 tank became separated from trailer and ended up about 50 yards off the highway. Todd was wearing a safety belt. No one else was injured and no property was damaged. No one was evacuated and traffic was not diverted due to the loss of Ammonia. LEPC was on scene. The wind was blowing to the Southwest at 5 –10 mph.",Driver was disciplined and drivers were warned to slow down and the speed rated on the tires.,Yes,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,44650,Skyland Grain LLC,US,
