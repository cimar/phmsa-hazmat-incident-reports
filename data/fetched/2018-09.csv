He tightened the valve plug and also reinstalled the cap on the  magnetic gauging device.  Seal number 0218347 was removed from the protective housing by the FRA.

(MEI), a CSXT emergency response contractor, were dispatched to the scene and found the release was due to a faulty hopper cover. The hopper covers ribs were displaced, tearing the cover, and allowing rain water to come in contact with the water reactive lading.  The introduction of water to the lading liberated and released ammonia vapors.  The response crew was able to make temporary repair to the cover and secure the load.

He then received a call from 911 dispatch letting Bobby know that an ambulance was en route to Jeff. Meanwhile, dispatcher Bill Couch contacted Morgan letting him know that she needed to call Bobby. Morgan reached out to Bobby, who, while on the line with Morgan, received a subsequent call from a responding officer, Officer Hubbard. Bobby provided Morgan with Officer Hubbard’s number. Officer Hubbard connected Morgan with Sargeant Gates, and local Emergency Responder Alton Haines. She was informed that there was a slow leak and that a response unit was needed. (It would later be discovered that there was another breach in the tanker.) Morgan utilized AIG's PIER program to get a unit on site. PIER's resource, Clean Harbors, led by District Manager Brian Overmyer, was sent on-site. During this time, Bobby updated Morgan that Jeff suffered a broken cheekbone, but was okay. Regarding vehicle damage, at this point, the truck and trailer are considered totaled. On 9/16, Brian Overmyer reported to Morgan that Clean Harbors was able to vacuum off approximately 7000 gallons of product from the tanker truck, up from the original report of 6500 gallons. Based on this information, it was initially estimated that between 300 and 900 gallons of product was released.  The morning of 9/17/18, Morgan was notified by Alton Haines and resident Michael Floyd that the incident occurred on and near properties with wells. Eco would contract with environmental consultants to perform soil and water monitoring at the site. Rich Luzinski, terminal coordinator Cara Waters, and Morgan worked together to collect documents such as truck and trailer registration, Peoplenet logs, BOL, and engine data. Peoplenet data indicates that Jeff was not in violation of any DOT HOS regulations. Engine data indicates, within the two minutes prior to the accident, Jeff was driving  between 48 and 63 mph. Prior to reading 0 mph, the last five seconds of the onboard event recorder indicate 63, 53, 47, 35, 41 mph. Later that morning, Rich Luzinski and Morgan Greenwood called Jeff Wright. Jeff indicated he was in pain and that he had lost his hearing aide and glasses. He also said that the seatbelt did not catch. He had a broken cheekbone and eye socket and stitches in his forehead. He had been released from the hospital at approximately 7am CST. Rich asked Jeff what happened that night and Jeff expressed that if there had been a sign at that curve ‘this wouldn’t have happened’. Jeff told Rich ‘ask any driver, everyone knows about that curve’. Rich asked what the speed limit was, Jeff indicated he did not know. Rich asked how the conditions were and Jeff said the road was wet. Rich asked Jeff if he felt he was driving at a safe speed given the conditions (tropical storm from Hurricane Florence). Jeff again referenced the curve. On 9/18/18, Morgan received the post-accident Driver/","For Eco-Energy, this incident confirms that speed management must be an integral part of our driver training and disciplinary program.

He applied floor dry material on the spill and then went inside of the trailer to determine which drum was leaking. Once in the trailer, he determined that the leak was somewhere in the front of the trailer. He couldn't safely determine exactly which drum was leaking, so he applied some floor dry material to the floor of the trailer which stopped liquid from leaking onto the black top.He then notified the Operations Manager for Heritage Transport to report the spill. The Op erations Manager then called the EHS Manager to inform him of the spill. The EHS Manager responded to the scene to supervise the cleanup and to investigate the incident. The EHS Manager determined that the trailer could be safely moved to the loading dock for unloading. Once the trailer was unloaded, the leaking drum was discovered. It was a thirty gallon plastic drum of Nitric Acid and Chromium. The drum had over pressurized and split in two places in the front of the drum. The splits were vertical and ran about eight to ten inches long. It is estimated that the drum originally held about 15 gallons of liquid.

According to the video we recovered from the accident, the inside view showed a behavior that is consistent with fatigue. He was holding his speed just fine, until the last half mile, where the speed slowly increased as he approached the last two downhill curves. Both curves had a posting of 35mph, and he allowed his speed to creep up to 50mph. The trailer rolled first, pulling over the truck. The fuel that released from the truck tank, leaked out the dome lids. The fuel that released from the trailer, was from a large hole, caused by the guard rail when the trailer rolled and struck it. Since both cargo tanks were laying on their sides, the releasing fuel stopped in less than 30 minutes. Within 1 minute of the accident, witnesses called 911& Emergency responders were immediately dispatched. The remaining fuel was removed, and the truck & trailer was up righted. The contaminated dirt was removed and transported to a recycling facility, and roadway that was affected, was re-paved.","Williams Tank Lines conducts 6 Safety Meetings a year for each one of our 8 Terminals, where all topics are discussed, including Defensive Driving & driving fatigued. We have had a program in place for several years, where Terminal Managers review video captured by the on-board camera's, to alert us of un-safe behaviors. This driver had a clean 12 year record with the company, and had been on the ""Day Shift"" 5am to 5pm for many years. During our investigative interview of the driver, it was discovered that he had stayed up later than normal to watch Thursday Night Football, which we feel was a major contributor to his fatigue. The cargo tanks are sound equipment, and short of making all tanks out of heavy gauge steel, which would be impractical, no re-design is necessary. One cannot remove the human element from our industry, all we can do is continue our frequent education to our employees on the need for proper rest.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,377246,WILLIAMS TANK LINES,US,

The shipment contained dangerous goods (DG) identified as UN3363  Dangerous Goods in Apparatus, Class 9.  The package was properly placarded and the required  paperwork was completed for the shipment including the shipper's declaration.   2. The shipment was accepted by HA Cargo in LIH and prepared for transport on HA184. 3. The cargo manifest indicated that the COMAT shipment contained DG.  4. The accompanying shipper's declaration indicated that the COMAT contained DG, and at the time  the cargo agent noticed that information was missing in the ""Nature of Goods Quantity"" section and the shipping label on the COMAT box had the incorrect UN number 3663 versus the correct 3363. 5. Cargo agent on duty sought assistance from Cargo Chief and Chief indicated that the shipment  contained DG and advised agent to make corrections to the AWB to include missing information and the label on the box. 6. Cargo agent made the corrections to the AWB and the shipping label. Cargo agent on duty inquired with the Cargo Chief   whether a dangerous goods checklist and Notification to Pilot in Command (NOPIC) was required. Chief cargo agent stated that the checklist and the NOPIC were not required. 7.The accepting cargo agent failed to complete the required dangerous goods checklist and  Notification to Pilot in Command (NOPIC) for the COMAT shipment. 8. The COMAT shipment was delivered to the aircraft and transported to HNL without the  required NOPIC being presented to the PIC or carried on the aircraft. 9. There was no failure of the package.  The root cause of the incident was that the Company's policy on the acceptance and handling of dangerous goods was not properly followed. According to 49 CFR 175.33 - Shipping paper and notification of pilot-in-command: The NOPIC document must be presented to the pilot in command (PIC) for signature and carried onboard the aircraft for the duration of the flight. The HA Cargo Manual Section 7.3.6.6 states that the cargo agent accepting dangerous goods will initiate a  a NOPIC. A copy of the NOPIC will be communicated to the load planning office.  The accepting cargo agent and the Chief cargo agent failed to properly follow the HA's procedures which  caused the COMAT shipment to be carried on the aircraft without the required NOPIC.","The accepting cargo agent was counseled by the manager on duty on 07SEPT2018 regarding the requirements of completing the DG checklist and  NOPIC  when accepting shipments containing DG. The cargo agent is aware of the policy and procedures and is current on DG acceptance and handling training.  Due to the severity of the incident, the Chief cargo agent is required to complete the initial DG acceptance and handling training and Record of Correction Action(ROCA) was issued.",No,BOX,"Box, wood or fiberboard not specified",BOX,No,Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC.",US,

Approved contractor Ocean Blue was dispatched to remediate the leak at the facility. Interior inspection revealed 8     250 gallon totes stowed 1 high and 2 wide with tygard for doorway securement. The leaking material was deemed hazardous by Ocean Blue. The origin of the leak was throughout the load. The heat caused the totes to swell, 4 caps cracked and pop off. With the caps off the liquid was able to spill out of multiple containers. The material inside the 250 gallon totes was UN1760 THPS     Urea Precondensate (hazardous) and 1   2 gallons spilled out between the 4 totes.

A Scout Energy Pumper, or the lease operator discovered the spill at approximately 9am on 09/24/18. 42 barrels of product was released through the trailer vent line onto the lease. Product migrated to a nearby creek. Scout Energy reported the release to the OCC, who contacted Chuck Firth (BKEP - VP EH&S), who contacted Steve Whitaker (BKEP - Director of Trucking). BKEP notified the NRC immediately upon receiving notification of the incident.     Scout Energy began immediate spill containment and remediation of both the lease and creek. Scout Energy with a roustabout crew, backhoe, and vacuum truck, began remediation of the lease site on 09/24/18 upon discovery of oil. Scout Energy and crew set booms in the creek to contain the release. The majority of the oil was cleaned up/removed by Scout the day of discovery.  Gary Wilkins of BKEP Pipeline and consultants from P&H took over clean up and remediation of the creek on the morning of 09/25/18. A containment weir was constructed approximately 3/4 mile from release site down the creek.  Vacuum tucks were set periodically between the weir and the release location.  The creek was continuously flushed with fresh water from tanker trucks and the oil was sucked up. Booms and oil soak pads were used to clean up th remaining residue.  A total of 7.81 barrels were removed from the creek. Remediation of the creek was signed off on by OCC on 10/01/18.","Emphasized DOT regulation(s) and BKEP requirement to be within 25' of the controls of a cargo tank during loading/unloading operations.

I moved the leaking package along with some damages out of the way along with what looked like a bottle of bleach without the lid. I then went back with absorbent and put it down on the spill.  New Comments: ISSUE: The issue the station had was that a damaged Hazmat package was not handled per procedure and it was processed late.  ROOT CAUSES: When the package got damaged the manager Justin Howe neglected to handle the situation immediately due to him not managing his work area effectively. Also Justin used the wrong type of absorbent to clean the spill.  This could have made the situation more dangerous. Also to add to the issue, QA did not take the time to learn how to process damaged Hazmats when the main clerk Terence (who handles all damaged hazmats in the facility) was on vacation.  They had already been told that they need to learn how to process damaged hazmats and were given the procedures on how to accomplish this part of their job.  They failed to learn this information due to management not following up with the QA personnel on their training and no initiative by the QA employees.  There was no communication between QA and management to make sure this process was not a failure.  FOLLOW UP:  All QA personnel have 1 month to learn the hazmat procedure while working with Terence.  He will make sure the works with each admin on the morning sort.  He will show them previous damaged Hazmats already completed and walk them through the proper procedures.Jeremiah will be in charge of making sure all clerks on the evening sort are prepared to handle damaged hazmats.   Karl Fisher will be in charge of making sure all Ops Managers review damaged Hazmat procedures especially regarding spill clean up.  To fix the communication issue, effective 9/26/2018 all damaged packages, hazmat or not will be sent in an email with a short description of the damage and  the location of the package and the date it was placed in the damage area(s).",,No,,,,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Fedex Ground Package System, Inc.",US,

It was reported that the cargo tanker was carrying a Hazardous, UN3082 material, that turned over and ended up in a ditch. The speed of the driver is unknown. The driver was able to get the top catch closed to prevent further impact. Contractors arrived onsite and at 1000 ET, confirmed approximately 100-gallons released from the dome lid of the iso tank because it was not tightened properly. At 1143 ET, Contractors reported that 70-gallons were recovered from the ditch and placed into (2) 55-gallon poly drums. Absorbent was applied to the ditch to solidify the residual. At 1224 ET, Contractors confirmed the product was successfully trans-loaded to a relief tank. The impacted 10' x 20' area was secured with poly sheeting. At 1258 ET, Contractors transported (3) drums of waste and departed site. On October 3, 2018, Contractors arrived back on site at 0930 ET to complete remediation. The soil was excavated, back-filled and seeded. An estimated 17 yards of impacted soil was removed.

Approved contractor Ocean Blue was dispatched to remediate the leak at the facility. Interior inspection revealed 8 -250 gallon totes stowed 1 high and 2 wide with tygard for doorway secured. The leaking material was deemed hazardous by Ocean Blue. The origin of the leak was throughout the load. The heat caused the totes to swell, 4 caps cracked and pop off. With the caps off the liquid was able to spill out of multiple containers. The material inside the 250 gallon totes was UN1760 THPS Urea PreCondensate (hazardous) and 1 -2 gallons spilled out between the 4 totes.

Preliminary investigation reveals traffic was stopped on Interstate 75 north bound due to an injury accident at mile marker 43 that the Laurel County Sheriff's Department was investigating. Due to the roadway narrowing from three (3) lanes to two (2) lanes and the roadway ahead was partially blocked, it resulted in stopped or slowly moving traffic for several minutes. Unit 1 was traveling north bound on Interstate 75 and struck Unit 2 in the rear causing a complete over ride as Unit 2 was stopped. The initial point of impact occurred in the far right hand lane parallel with the on-ramp. Both units then struck unit 3 in the rear also in the far right lane resulting in a domino effect of each unit thereafter striking the unit in front of them, all in the right hand lane. As unit 3 struck unit 4, unit 4 struck unit 5 and unit 5 struck unit 6.

THE OPERATOR IN CHARGE OF LOADING INTENDED TO OPEN THE VAPOR VALVE ON THE RAIL CAR TO VENT THE CAR DURING FILLING; HOWEVER, THE 2-INCH PRODUCT UNLOADING VALVE, WHICH HAS A DIP-TUBE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR, WAS MISTAKENLY OPENED INSTEAD OF THE VENT VALVE, WHICH REMAINED CLOSED. NOTE THAT PDCB HAS A FREEZE POINT OF APPROXIMATELY 127 FAHRENHEIT & IS A SOLID AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURES; PDCB IS HEATED DURING STORAGE & TRANSFERS AT STOLTHAVEN HOUSTON TO FACILITATE PRODUCT MOVEMENT. RAIL CARS RECEIVED FOR PDCB LOADING OFTEN CONTAIN RESIDUAL, SOLIDIFIED PDCB PRODUCT IN THE SUMP AREA & ALSO IN THE DIP-TUBE. THE DIP-TUBE IN TILX 210129 WAS PLUGGED WITH SOLIDIFIED PDCB AT THE START OF LOADING, WHICH PREVENTED THE RAIL CAR FROM VENTING PROPERLY. ONCE THIS RESIDUAL, SOLIDIFIED PDCB IN THE DIP-TUBE MELTED AS THE CAR FILLED WITH HOT PDCB FROM TANK A20-1, THE BUILT-UP PRESSURE IN THE CAR RELEASED THROUGH THE DIP-TUBE & OPEN 2-INCH VALVE, CAUSING LIQUID PDCB TO SPRAY FROM THE TOP OF THE CAR. THE CAR WAS SECURED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30. THE RELEASED PDCB WAS CONTAINED ON-SITE & NO NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS WERE THREATENED BY THIS RELEASE. STOLTHAVEN HOUSTON'S OIL SPILL RESPONSE ORGANIZATION (""OSRO"") WAS NOTIFIED OF THIS INCIDENT & MOBILIZED A CREW TO THE FACILITY TO PERFORM THE NECESSARY CLEAN-UP & RESPONSE EFFORTS. THE RELEASED PDCB PRODUCT SOLIDIFIED QUICKLY AS IT COOLED, WHICH ASSISTED IN CLEAN-UP OF THE AFFECTED AREAS.  NOTE THAT AT THE TIME OF THIS EVENT RAIL CAR TILX 210129 WAS STATIONARY & LOADING AT THE STOLTHAVEN HOUSTON TERMINAL, THE CAR WAS NOT CONNECTED TO ANY MOTIVE FORCE, & IT HAD NOT YET BEEN OFFERED FOR TRANSPORTATION. THERE WAS NO -FF-SITE IMPACT, NO INJURIES, AND NO EQUIPMENT DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT.","WHILE THE VALVES ON RAIL CAR TILX 210129 WERE LABELED CORRECTLY, THESE LABELS WERE IN POOR CONDITION AND WERE DIFFICULT TO READ. FURTHERMORE, THE VALVE ARRANGEMENT VARIES BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CUSTOMER RAIL CARS THAT ARE LOADED WITH PDCB AT THE STOLTHAVEN HOUSTON TERMINAL. HUMAN ERROR LED TO THE INCORRECT VALVE BERING OPENED WHEN ATTEMPTING TO VENT THE CAR DURING PDCB LOADING; THE TASK WAS PERFORMED BASED ON MEMORY INSTEAD OF READING THE VALVE LABELS. STOLTHAVEN HOUSTON OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT WILL HOLD AN AWARENESS SESSION WITH OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL TO REVIEW RAIL CAR VALVE ARRANGEMENT & THE FUNCTION OF EACH CONNECTION POINT. STOLTHAVEN HOUSTON'S PDCB CUSTOMER WILL ALSO BE CONTACTED TO IMPROVE RAIL CAR VALVE CONFIGURATION LABELS & TO IMPLEMENT A COLOR CODED SYSTEM TO IMPROVE VALVE RECOGNITION.

Approved contractor Ocean Blue was dispatched to remediate the leak at the facility. Interior inspection revealed 8 250-gallon totes stowed 1 high and 2 wide with tygard for doorway securement. The leaking material was deemed hazardous by Ocean Blue. The origin of the leak was throughout the load. The heat caused the totes to swell, 4 caps cracked and pop off. With the caps off the liquid was able to spill out of multiple containers. The material inside the 250 gallon totes was UN1760 THPS Urea Precondensate (hazardous) and 1   2-gallons spilled out between the 4 totes.
