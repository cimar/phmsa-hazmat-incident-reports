There was approximately 60 gallons of methanol in the tanker compartment when the IMTT Operator discovered methanol dripping from the flange at the internal valve.  The IMTT Operator immediately shut down the system and secured the product line and truck valves.  A 5-gallon bucket was placed under the valve to collect the dripping methanol.  The remaining methanol in the tanker compartment was drained into a 55-gallon drum.  The truck was then released by IMTT so it could return to Quality Carriers for necessary repairs.,IMTT-Bayonne contacted the customer of the product to inform them of the incident.

During the course of the trip, the driver conducted a routine load check and identified material leaking from the trailer onto his tires at a rest area. The driver mmediately place an absorbent material down to absorb the free liquid and prevent the spread of the release. Once secured, he notified his home dispatcher and the Danville Fire Department. The fire department contacted a local firm to respond to the spill clean up. Upon arrival the team, utilizing appropriate personal protective equipment, entered the trailer and initiated the removal of containers in order to identify the leaking container. It was discovered that one 5 gallon container was leaking from the bottom seam. The crew placed the leaking containers into a suitable over pack and proceeded to absorb and collect all free liquids. This material was placed into the salvage drums along with all materials used to decontaminate the trailer floor. In addition, the absorbent used to collect the material that escaped from the trailer was collected and this to was placed into the salvage drums for disposal. Once the clean up was complete, the trailer was reloaded and was sent on to the intended waste management facility where the shipment was received and processed for disposal. PA environmental officer Don Farrell was satisfied with the response and clean up.","At the time the container was accepted for transporttion, no evidence of leaking was observed. It is believed that the that during transpotation an ajacent pallet gouged the bottom of the container allowing the material to leak from the container. In order to prevent a recurrence, the individuals that offered the shipment for transportation and the driver in posession of the shipment have been re instructed to ensure that each drum is inspected before it is accepted for transportation.

Responders reported finding the leak source at the liquid eduction line's closure cap area. The closure cap was not fully tightened on its threaded connection. The closure cap's safety or retention chain was pinched in the threaded area by the bottom of the cap; thus interfering with and preventing the closure cap from being fully tightened on its threaded connection. Internal pressure within GATX 5817 was reduced, the closure cap removed and the cap's safety/retention chain repositioned. Teflon tape was applied to the threads of the closure cap and it was reapplied and properly tool tightened by 1700 hrs. MDT, 6/05/2011.

This incidient occurred on 06/21/11 at approximately 1315 hours at Boxley's Piney River facility. Driver Tim Milton (Foster Fuels' driver)had 7300 gallons to deliver to the Piney River facility. At the time of the release driver Milton was at the end of the unloading process emptying the hoses with the pump still engaged. Product started to spray from the top dome overflow into the containment area and gravel lot. The dome had a lid on it that was not sealed for pressure release and the small openings created a spray effect. Driver Milton immediately stopped the pump and unloading process. Estimate time of the product release is less than one minute. At the time of the release Boxley's storage tank had no means to gauge the liquid capacity of the storage tank. All product release was contained in the containment area and gravel lot, no product reached any public or natural waterway.","Driver Milton is trained in the loading and unloading procedures at Foster Fuels and has unloaded at this facility in the past unloading the amount of product ordered by Boxley. Driver Milton acted according to emergency shut down company procedures.  Boxley is in the process of up grading all of their storage tanks with gauge devices so the liquid content of each tank will be known before the unloading process begans.  Foster Fuels would perfer that the gauge devices be installed before delivery in made in the future at Boxley, if no measuring devices are in place Foster Fuels will require assistance from the facility on amounts of product on hand. No type of equipment failure of Foster Fuels is attributed to this incident.  Foster Fuels will continue to provide training and reviewing incidents like this one for the benefit of all HM employees.

Movement was stopped and UTLX 208123 was carefully moved and isolated at a repair track in the railyard. Inspection by a BNSF mechanical responder found the manway closure and all operating valves secure with no visible indications of product leakage. UTLX 208123 was monitored over the weekend with no further indications of any product release. On 6/06/2011, UTLX 208123 was moved from the repair track and switched into other railcars. During this coupling event product was expelled from the pressure relieve device (PRD) atop UTLX 208123. UTLX 208123 was carefully moved and isolated in the railyard. Spillage on the tank shell evaporated and no further product release was evident when UTLX 208123 remained motionless. The shipper was notified of the defective PRD and made arrangements to transfer product to trucks and afterwards have the PRD replaced.  Product transfer was completed on 6/15/2011 without further incident. The failed McKenzie 165 psig pressure relief valve (PRV) was replaced in kind on 6/16/2011. The repair responders reported that the failed PRV sustained a broken stem. The PRV spring and associated retainer hardware were not recovered from the inner tank.

As the truck was approaching the scale, product was discovered leaking from the wash out cap on top of the tanker compartment next to the dome.    IMTT Operations personnel questioned the driver and determined that the wash out cap had not been properly tightened.  Further investigation also showed that product had leaked on the roadway from where the area where the truck was loaded to the current location at the scale.  IMTT Operations personnel contacted EQ-Terminal Services (IMTT's OSRO) to clean up the impacted areas of the roadway.  The Linden driver properly secured the wash out cap and the impacted areas of the tanker compartment were wiped clean.  The truck was weighed and released without further incident.",IMTT-Bayonne contacted the customer of the product to inform them of the incident.

While moving two drums and turning into the receiving trailer, the employee sneezed multiple times and temporarily lost control of the fork-lift.  The fork-lift was accidentally steered towards the receiving trailer door frame.  One of the drums was gouged by a door hinge resulting in a spill of approximately fifteen gallons of material. The gouge in the drum was six inches in length and two inches in width and was located in the upper side of the drum.  The release lasted no more than 20 seconds and the material that leaked was cleaned up and sent to a proper waste disposal facility.  The gouged drum was overpacked and also sent to a proper waste disposal facility.","Veolia employees at Schenectady, NY were trained to cease operating a fork-lift when a bout of sneezing occurs.

Tank was safely isolated to track 48 south end. Responder found cause of release to be a defective manway gasket.The shipper caused this defect by not properly positioning the nozzle gasket before closing manway.      KCS emergency services were activated to provide for railroad safety qualified services to mitigate this emergency (e.g., special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, management oversight, train/yard crew delay, and regulatory notification reports).  KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 may apply.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

The railcar remained set up after first transfer.  A Loader, with the required PPE, climbed to the top up the railcar and identified the product tee fitting as being loose.  Pressure inside the railcar forced liquid out from around the loose fitting.  Several pictures were taken of the spill and the leaking tee fitting.  Approximately 2 gallons of product leaked from the railcar to the 1'x 1"" square gravel area beside the track. No product entered the storm drain. Lime was used to neutralize the acid. All clean up material was put into containers and labeled.",ROOT CAUSE:   1. The railcar was not depressurized prior to the Loader leaving the transfer area unattended because it was not specifically stated in the Site-Specific Procedure (SSP).   2. The pipe connection was not properly tool tight when the transfer was originally set-up due to wear and tear of the fitting.     3. The stainless steel pipe tee was not properly inspected to identify excessive wear before being utilized for the transfer.     CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:   1. Add warning to SSP 3025-002 to reflect that railcars should be depressurized if there isn’t another trailer readily available to load.   2. Terminal will inspect and remove from service all fittings and connections that may be damaged or have excessive wear and tear from use.,No,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,TRANSFLO / Kinder Morgan,US,

The rail flatcar that CSXU 632694 was riding upon was setout of the train for further inspection. CSXU 632694 was deramped/grounded at the railyard's containment area. BNSF contract responders inspecting the interior of CSXU 632694 reported finding no blocking and bracing of 10 pallets of hazardous material drums loaded four drums per pallet located at the nose of this container. The drums were bound by a single securement banding around the four drum set on each pallet. These drums were the only lading inside CSXU 632694, therefore creating a huge void from the container's nose area to the rear doorway. Twelve steel 55 gallon drums (UN 1A1/Y1.4/150/1107) had leaked contents with six of these drums almost releasing their entire contents. All drums appeared distressed to some degree with top and bottom drum heads bulging along with some drum sidewalls nicked and abraded. The leaking drums had bottom head stress cracks with pinhole leaks in the crack line. Holes in the leaking drums were patched with epoxy where appropriate and placed into over-pack drums. All other drums were also placed into over-pack drums. Impacted soils near CSXU 632694 were shoveled into poly bags and placed into a recovery drum. The bottom intermodal container that sustained product leakage on its exterior was cleaned. The interior of the CSXU 632694 was cleaned of spillage. Expended cleaning supplies were placed into recovery drums. All 40 over-pack drums along with all recovery drums were returned inside CSXU 632694 properly blocked and braced for further transport.     The labeling on these imported drums indicated that the product manufacturer and distributer was PSV Services SRL in Tornaco (NO), Italy. It appears that this drum shipment was reloaded into CSXU 632694 after their arrival in Miami, FL (Port of Entry).",Ensure shipper inspects non-bulk hazardous material shipment packages for damages and transport worthiness prior to loading them into intermodal containers with the appropriate blocking and bracing also applied.,Yes,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,25000,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The CID made required Louisiana State Police notification. Found the top operated bottom outlet valve (BOV) completely open. Incident mitigated by closing the BOV.  Also, found the BOV secondary closure cap loose, simply threaded on BOV. The BOV cap was then secured tool tight. Approximately 2 gallons released from unsecured BOV and cap. The other closures were checked and the liquid and vapor lines were found closed and secondary plugs tool tight. However, the manway cover was found less than tool tight. The manway gasket was inspected and found in satisfactory condition and the residue heel was found to be 10 inches wide.     KCS emergency services were activated to provide for railroad safety qualified services to mitigate this emergency (e.g., special switching for safety isolation, yard service interruption, Critical Incident Desk notifications, emergency response, management oversight, train/yard crew delay, and regulatory notification reports).  KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260 may apply.    Item 27, amount in package, was estimated by f5800.1 report preparer because: shipper only provided bulk quantity on shipping paper, as 1 Tank Car, per PHMSA DOT requirements; and because the PHMSA DOT e-system requires data in this field to match the same units used in the capacity field.    The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels.

The CID notified the Louisiana State Police per regulatory requirement. Also, CID notified shipper via Chemtrec.    Responders reported that venting release sourced from frangible disk housing. The house bolts was tightened to stop the release. Each bolt was tightened approximately  turn. There was no liquid lading released, only a very small about of vapor/fume. The disk was inspected from the top side and found to be in good condition. This condition would have been very difficult for an unloading facility to discover and should have been detected and corrected at the load origin.     An addition tank car, NATX 210012, Residue: Last Contained Hydrochloric Acid, was also inspected as a suspect leaker. No leak could be identified on this car. All fitting where tightened as a precaution. No fittings were found loose or actively leaking.    Item 27, amount in package, was estimated by f5800.1 report preparer because: shipper only provided bulk quantity on shipping paper, as 1 Tank Car, per PHMSA DOT requirements; and because the PHMSA DOT e-system requires data in this field to match the same units used in the capacity field.    Item 19: No liquid product was released by this car. Only product odor vapors were released. PHMSA DOT reporting system will not allow reporting vapor release from a liquid commodity. Therefore this minor vapor release is reported as 0.01 gallon.    Shipper has been so advised that, for business unit planning, that all 3rd party costs associated with this incident, along with special switch charges will be invoiced to Shipper of record FSTI Inc. under KCS Switching Terminal Tariff 8100 Item 860 and KCS Rules Publication Tariff 9011 + 9012 Item 260.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. packages or closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

The loader quickly closed the trailer valve and called code yellow over the radio. Terminal personnel reacted promptly and placed lime onto the release to neutralize and absorb the product. Absorbent pads were placed over the area as well to further help with the cleanup of the material. Later the product was cleaned up and contained for disposal at a later date.",ROOT CAUSES:   1. Loader failed to install the product transfer hose to the railcar due to the fact that he was aggravated and distracted after having a disagreement with a fellow employee.   2. Verifier failed to inspect the transfer set up and subsequently “pencil whipped” the Work Order by signing off as having verified prior to inspecting transfer set up.  3. Loader failed to install plug on railcar side of the product transfer hose after 1st part of split load. The cap was not in the vicinity of the product hose.      CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:   1. Retraining to take place to include:   a. Training the Loader and Verifier on SSP 3025-002 Transferring Corrosive via Blower Pac/Air Compressor.   b. Training the Verifier on Kinder Morgan’s Verification policy.  c. Training Loader to ensure all liquid hoses are capped when not in use.   2.

NO PACKAGING FAILURE.  Following unloading of DOT 407 specification trailer, driver followed normal procedure of opening upper vent valve to depressurize tank (tank is pressurized with compressed air prior to unloading in order to push product off).  Driver failed to close upper vent valve prior to leaving unloading facility (New Wales).  Approximately 45 minutes later, upon loading tank with sulfuric acid, driver departed loading facility (South Pierce) with upper vent valve open. Upon agitation with vehicle movement, sulfuric acid sloshed out of open upper vent valve and out the 2 inch discharge at the bottom of trailer creating approximately a 1/2 mile intermittant trail (6-8"" wide)of sulfuric acid along West Bound County Rd 630. Driver noticed the spillage when he stopped at the first set of RR tracks.  CR 630 is lightly travelled, and Polk County Sheriff's Department and SWS Environmental responded and neutralized spill with soda ash.  Contaminated Soda Ash was removed and disposed of.  No waterways or drainage systems were impacted.",This spill was 100% driver error.

Upon arrival at destination, the carrier notified shipper that one of the IBC's developed a small drip. Response contractor was engaged to repond and transfer the contents into drums for safe transport. Duration of the response was approximately 5 hours. No injuries, exposures nor road closures resulted from this incident.    Subject IBC was built 11/2007, was in current UN test, and was inspected prior to fill.    Post incident inspection and testing of the IBC revealed a hairline crack in the weld fusing the 2""NPT discharge nipple to the bottom head of the tank. Close inspection of the valvetrain showed a proper valve and plumbing configuration as well as proper alignment within the outer tank edge for protection. There was no evidence of impact to the valve or tank area.","In this case, given that the tank utilized was in test, in good condition, showed no evidence of any leakage at time of fill and shipping, and showed no evidence of any impacts or damage during shipping it is believed that road vibration may have played a role in the failure.    As a result, shipper is exploring the feasibility of use of certain field  applicable non destructive testing (NDT) procedures in order to provide a better ability to visually inspect IBC welds for possible signs of stress that may be difficult or impossible to detect via normal means. If possible / feasible, this would occur in addition to the UN leakproofness test as prescribed in 49CFR178.813",No,IBC,"Metal, for liquids or solids",31A,Yes,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Univar USA,US,

The trailer contains equipment such as work platforms, lifting and handling components, and helium leak testing components. This type of shipment is routine, and is normally performed by one of the two commercial carriers on contract to the DOE at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). In this instance, the carriers were unavailable, so the WIPP transportation group requested a procurement specialist to obtain the services of a third commercial carrier to transport this equipment. An accurate hazardous material bill of lading (BOL) was provided to the procurement specialist, who in turn provided it to the third commercial carrier. This draft BOL identified the shipment as containing hazardous materials (4 pressurized gas cylinders, 2 of helium, and 2 of nitrogen, all properly labeled, marked and secured). The procurement specialist discussed the presence of the cylinders with the carrier when the draft BOL was provided. The carrier created their own BOL, but in doing so, inadvertently omitted the gas cylinder information and thus identified the shipment as containing no hazardous materials, and returned it to the procurement specialist for signature. The procurement specialist, having discussed the matter with the carrier, assumed that the documentation was correct, and signed the carrier BOL. The carrier BOL was not given to the WIPP Transportation group for review or signature due to the use of an outdated revision of a procedure by the procurement specialist who assumed a Transportation review was unnecessary.",The following measures have been taken to prevent recurrence: Revisions will be processed to procedures to assure that the authority to sign BOLs is assigned to properly trained individuals for both hazardous and non hazardous shipments; users of applicable procedures will be provided with current revisions; roles and responsibilities will be defined in a new procedure to emphasize inter-departmental responsibilities and authorities.,No,CYLINDER,"Seamless steel, made of definitely prescribed steels",3AA,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,WASHINGTON TRU SOLUTIONS LLC,US,

Hoskins Road,Charlotte,NC,28216,Facility,"Approximately 20 gallons of Xylene overflowed from compartment #5 of Nexeo trailer 35629.  The trailer was in the process of a transload from railcar CTCX 731251.  Upon investigation, the spill began when the loader was purging line from the railcar to the trailer with air creating a surge or a bubble that erupted over the opening. The compartment holds 2450 gallons and 2400 gallons were loaded before purging the line.  A spill pan was placed under the overflow hoses but due to the mounting of the hoses, overflow bounced off the inside of the back bumper causing it to miss the spill pan.  Some product impacted the spill pan, while the remaining product was contained in sand and absorb all material.  No product impacted the storm drain. Jeff Mitchell from Mecklenburg County Water Quality verified the same.","ROOT CAUSES:  1. The experienced Loader believed he could load 2400 gallons of product into a compartment that has a capacity of 2450 gallons while having sufficient headroom for blowback.  Due to the high level of product, when the line was purged, an estimated thirty gallons of residual product and a surge of air created a bubble causing product to spill out of the manway.    2. There are no written or specified outage amounts for trailers.     CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  1. Management must determine the proper outage amount for the filling of liquid trailers.    2. Develop training for flammable product release response to include the use of proper tools such as aluminum shovels.    3. Request that TRANSFLO communicate the Carrier make alterations to the configuration of overflow tubes to better direct product into the spill pan.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,TRANSFLO/Kinder Morgan,US,

According to Mr. Murphy, he was assisting fellow Dump & Roll-Off Division independent contractor David Patterson with a hazardous substance spill in Wapakoneta, OH. According to Mr. Murphy, Mr. Patterson loaded K061 furnace dust at Steel Dynamics, Inc. in Butler, IN on Tuesday, June 14, 2011 at approximately 4:30 a.m. While loading Mr. Murphy and Mr. Patterson noticed that they may be over on the drive axles when Mr. Patterson would have to fuel. Mr. Patterson fueled his tractor at the TA Truck Stop in Wapakoneta, Ohio. Ater fueling, Mr. Patterson raised the dump body of D322 so he could shift some of the load to the rear of the trailer. However, while raising the dump body, some of the dust broke loose and spilled over the tailgate of the trailer between the top and the tarp. According the Mr. Murphy, approximately 500-700 pounds of the product ended up on the asphalt of the parking lot directly behind the trailer. In his estimation, the spill covered an area of approximately three feet by 4 feet and  making a pile approximately two feet high. He stated they swept the dust into a  pile and covered the pile with a tarp to keep it from blowing due to breezy  conditions. Mr. Murphy was instructed to inform the management of the TA Truck  Stop and call the local authorities. This writer asked for and received the  Emergency Response Telephone number from the UHWM, UHWM # and the  amount of the product loaded.","ALL DRIVERS ARE BEING INSTRUCTED TO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, SHIFT A LOAD IN A TRAILER BY LIFTING THE DUMP BED.

He had just loaded theethanol 14 miles from the accident site. Driver was eastbound on Route 31A traveling about 50 mph entering a curvein the road when the driver failed to continue on the road and went through the curve taking out a powerline pole andthen went into a heavily wooded area where he struck a large tree and several others.It has been speculated that during this time that the fuel tank was ruptured and caught fire and possibly the trailertanker itself. The driver sustained injuries and was unable to make it out of the cab before the entire unit wasengulfed in fire.Response came from local emergency personnel who were able to get the fire controlled and extinguished but wereunable to save the driver. FJ Transportation was notified and dispatched a hazmat team to get the remaining productout of the tanker and remediate the area. Product did not get into any waterways and all measures available wereused to mitigate the damage to the surrounding environment. Remediation efforts were coordinated with the NYDepartment of Conservation representative Tom Hall. The National Response Center was also notified, (NRC#979616)",The police report has still not been released to see what they determined as the cause. The driver had gone throughall orientation and training classes with our company. He had spent the past 3 weeks training with his Lead Driver.He had multiple years in the the trucking and tanker industries.

This order was an immediate need as they had a patient going in for surgery the next day. We rerouted a shipment on June 2, 2011 meant for another site and in doing so we inadvertently shipped them ten (10) seeds for the procedure instead of the hundred (100) that they requested. Both packages of seeds are packaged in our standard Type A package from our distributor in Germany to ensure safe transport overseas. While investigating how this mishap occurred, our Holland office asked one of our account managers to send back the labels from the box and any additional hazardous goods documents. The account manager spoke with both the hospital and a salesman in the area. On June 24, 2011, a Nucletron salesman went to Brigham and Women’s Hospital and collected the package that the salesman understood contained only the documents in question. He then took the package to a nearby mail box store and sent the package back the US Nucletron office. The mailbox store shipped it without the necessary markings and the box arrived undamaged and unopened in the Nucletron office in Columbia, MD on June 28, 2011.   The package was opened in the US office, and an approved stainless steel shielded container was discovered. From the information on the label it was determined that it contained ten (10) radioactive seeds. The shielded container for the radioactive seeds was never opened as the pictures show the autoclave bag has not been tampered with. As soon as the package was opened, a wipe test and two readings were taken.   Two dose rate readings were taken from outside the dispose container and a wipe test was conducted: the results could not distinguish from background (0) reading taken on most sensitive setting. Below are the meter identification and calibration due dates.   Meter ID: Ludlum 165951   Calibration Due Date:6/14/12   Meter ID: Ludlum 170195   Calibration Due Date: 2/23/12   Wipe Test: Inspector 08558   Calibration Due Date: 6/14/12","Moving forward, the shipment of radioactive materials will only be undertaken on the instruction of the radiation safety officer or equivalent in the specific region of the shipment. The management team in the US has made this decision and it will be communicated to the field in an email and phone call for all field service engineers and sales associates in the coming days.

The path of the ethanol ran down the sides to the ground ofthe railcar (NATX-364454) from shipper Valero Marketing with Hazmat Number 050409 001 008RT. The spill left a 4 foot wide visible path down the sides of the tank car. The drip pan under the rail car caught a majority of the ethanol, but it overflowed and product impacted the soil. Product also missed the drip pan and directly impacted the soil directly surrounding the drip pan. The total square footage of impacted soil is approximately 8 feet. The estimated amount of ethanol that impacted the soil is 25 gallons. The RQ for ethanol is 15 gallons.    Further investigation indicated that the check valve located behind the block valve at spot 5B where the car was connected didn't hold. The release occurred because of a faulty check valve. The ethanol product specifically spilled through a 1"" valve on top of the railcar. No one was impacted by product and all PPE was properly worn during the incident.    Any mitigation actions taken at the time of the incident. The block valve on the line connected to the product hose was closed immediately, stopping the product from continuing to fill the rail car. The impacted rock and soil was shoveled and placed into a labeled satellite drum. The block valve that connects to the block valve was then locked out. The depth of ethanol contamination in the soil and rocks underneath the rail car was approximately 4 inches. All impacted soil and rocks were excavated and stored in a 55-gallon drum. One 55-gallon drum was generated from this spill. The drum was labeled as hazardous waste and was placed in the final storage area awaiting shipment to approved RCRA facility.",Cleanup is considered complete and no further soil remediation is planned.
