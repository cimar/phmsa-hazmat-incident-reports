Material that had spilled onto the roadway evaporated before a contractor could reach the scene.",The driver involved in this incident has undergone specific cargo tank training with emphasis on manhole and valve closures many times in the past.

Movement was stopped and no further product release was observed when PLMX 30182 remained motionless. A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder inspected PLMX 30182 and observed product staining around the base of the manway nozzle with all spillage evaporating.  All manway securement bolts were found tool tight and a manway gasket sealing problem was suspected as the leak cause. No suitable replacement manway gasket was readily available to the BNSF responder, so a response contractor was summoned to replace PLMX 30182's manway gasket. In the mid-afternoon of 6/06/2012, contract responders replaced the damaged manway gasket applied onto PLMX 30182 and resecured the manway closure. The removed manway gasket appeared compressed with some shredding noted around the gasket's inner circumference.

A BNSF mechanical responder immediately inspected GATX 54178 and reported the leak source was the manway closure.  All six manway securement bolts were not tool tight which prevented a good manway closure seal. The responder properly tool tightened all manway securement bolts. The shipper manway seal was intact and remained intact after the manway was secured. The responder wiped product spillage from GATX 54178's safety appliances. No ground impact from spillage was prevalent.

Product was contained to concrete containment area at consignee location, Flint Hills Resources.  Consignee employee used a vinegar solution to neutralize the free product, which was then washed into the containment drain.  There was no impact to surface soils or threat to state waters.  A small amount of product sprayed onto the Flint Hill Resources employee during disconnection, and he was instructed to shower and wash affected areas.

The car was isolated in the car shop, away from CSXT employees, awaiting a transfer due to a defective liquid line valve. The shipper, Marathon Petroleum Company, was notified through shipper contact number 877-627-5463. A CSXT emergency response contractor, SWS Environmental, was dispatched to respond to the scene and found the liquid valve, where it is attached to the liquid line pipe, was leaking. The issue identified and corrective actions were communicated to shipper representative, Roger Spring, 606 921 6255. SWS secured the leak by removing the valve, cleaning the threads, placing pipe tape on threads and replacing the valve. The leak was secured and the car was held for transfer into another rail car and return of rail car once empty to the Marathon Plant for repairs This incident did NOT require a special switch move.

No product release was observed when ECUX 371018 remained motionless and leaked liquid evaporated. Contract responders inspected ECUX 371018 finding the bottom operated bottom outlet valve's (BOV) operating handle not secured in the closed position. The operating handle appeared modified at the handle pin seating area and would not hold in the closed position. The BOV operating handle was moved to the closed position and wired securely to keep it stationary. The leak source was at the BOV closure cap which was not tool tight. With the BOV in the closed position, the bottom outlet cap (BOC) was removed to inspect the BOC gasket and check for further residue product drips. The BOC gasket appeared serviceable and no liquid was observed at the BOV outlet with the BOV closed. The BOC was reapplied and properly tool tightened.

The driver spoke to an Intercon chemical operator upon arrival and proceeded to hook up to the connection indicated by the chemical operator.  A sample was taken from the trailer and the driver waited approximately 45 minutes for the product to be approved for unloading.  The chemical operator told the driver the product was approved, connected properly and he was good to unload.  The driver started unloading.  The tank the product is unloaded into is located inside a building with the connection to the trailer outside where the driver was unloading.  The driver was not able to view the tank or inside valves from the unloading area.  The chemical operator went into the building during unloading.  Approximately 15 minutes after starting the unload process, the chemical operator came outside and told the driver to shut down the unloading, in which he did immediately.  The driver was then told that the chemical operator had failed to shut off an inside valve before having the driver unload.  This valve is normally used by Intercon to unload product from the tank and is not visible from the truck unloading area. Approximately 900 gallons was released out of the tank valve onto the floor of the building.        The chemical operator closed the valve on the tank and had the driver continue unloading the product.  The tank had 3700 gallons of the 4600 gallons when the unloading was completed.  This report is being completed by Newsom Trucking to report an unintentional release during unloading.  No delivery equipment failed during this incident.  The failure was caused by Intercon chemical operator error by leaving the valve on the Intercon tank open during the unloading process.",The driver followed Newsom Trucking procedures.  He verified with the Intercon chemical operator before unloading that he was connected to the correct line and got approval before starting the unloading process.  He stayed within 15 feet of the trailer and was able to shut down the unload immediately.   He reported the incident to his supervisor as soon as possible.  The driver will continue to work with the chemical operators to try to prevent this type of incident by asking questions before unloading and verifying connection to the correct piping.,Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,0,Newsom Trucking,US,

Following receipt, the package was placed in a flammable material cabinet pending deliver to the final location (Sigma V Building).  The Teamster who transported the material to Sigma V reported odors in the flammable cabinet but no evidence of leakage in the cabinet or from the package.  Closer examination of the outer box noted dried stains and smeared ink that could have been related to a solvent leak.    The package was opened on June 14, 2012 in a fume hood at Sigma V.  Within the box was a plastic bag containing a single, small absorbent pad and a shrink-wrapped box.   The inner box was not damaged and the shrink wrap was intact; however, there was evidence of staining on the box inside the shrink wrap; within the inner box, the internal dividers were all damaged.  The inner box contained four 25-ml bottles of triethylamine.  The tamper-evident lids on the bottles were all intact.  Two of the four bottles were completely empty and one other bottle was half empty.  There was evidence that the red dye from the bottle lid had leached and stained the inner components of the inner box.  There was no wetness on any package components.   There was no evidence that the absorbent pad had absorbed any material.  There was no evidence of cracks or damage to the bottles or lids.    The bottles were identified as a Product of Belgium with a specific lot number.      Sigma Aldrich was contacted and they sent a replacement package overnight.  The second outer package had no evidence of damage but there were stains similar to the first.  The configuration within the outer package was similar to the first although there were two absorbent pads and additional paper to minimize movement within the outer package.  The inner box was again undamaged with intact shrink wrap but there was evidence of staining on the box.  Within the inner box, there was again evidence of damage to the inner components of the box.  The tamper-indicating lids were all intact and there were no cracks in the bottle or lids.   There was no wetness.  Three of the four 25-ml bottles in the second shipment were empty.  There was no evidence that the absorbent pads had absorbed any material.  The lot number on the second four bottles was the same as on the first four bottles.    In neither case was there a leak to clean.    There is no evidence to indicate at what stage the damage occurred – it may have occurred before it was received by Sigma Aldrich.  FedEx is listed as the carrier in this report, but it is not known that leakage occurred during their transport.  It is not known who transported the material from the country of origin.    Sigma Aldrich has asked that we return the two shipments so they can look into it further.","Unknown cause.

Spillage on CBTX 740004's side shell was migrating downward and dripping onto the ground. BNSF mechanical personnel wiped the spillage off the side shell with absorbent pads and a contractor remediated ground spillage by collecting impacted ballast/soil followed by an application of Micro-Blaze microbial solution. Absorbent padding was placed inside the valve housing area to absorb any additional leakage. CBTX 740004 was carefully moved to the facility's containment area (pit). Contract responders inspecting CBTX 740004 reported finding the liquid valve  (4 inch flanged Jamesbury  ball valve) installed incorrectly (inverted) which allowed product to escape via the mounting flange (fitting plate) connection area as the studs nuts could not be fully tool tightened when valve was in the inverted position. The responders removed the liquid valve and correctly installed it by 1300 hrs. CDT on 6/08/2012.  Afterwards, a nitrogen leak test with internal pressure up to 30 psi was conducted and no further product leakage was observed. CBTX 740004 was power washed and all liquid collected in the containment pit was earmarked for appropriate disposal.

Once the tank was weighed, the crew intended to take it to interchange with Norfolk Southern on #1 Connelly track. After going over the B-Yard scale, a crew member noticed steam coming from the end tank and reported the incident. It was determined that a heater coil (thermo-coupler) at the end of the tank had failed and elevated temperature material was leaking. Weight of the tank at the time it went over the scale was 170400 lbs and 117600 when it returned to Koppers. Material quickly solidified once cooled. Dikes were created to contain spill and once material cooled enough the flow stopped. Weavertown Environmental Group was contracted to remediate the spill and dispose of material.",The failure of this tank's thermo coupler did not occur until the tank car was in transit.

KCS emergency services were notified and a response team was initiated.    At 3:00 PM Hazmat responders arrived on site to check the car for cause of leak. Upon visual inspection of the car, it was determined that the pressure plate of the car was not completely sealed; identified by approximately 3 bolts loose on the pressure plate apparatus. Responders were successful in tightening the pressure plate with pneumatic wrench 1/10 - 1/4 turn during a full tightening process. Snoop Solution was used to verify no more leaks had occurred.

To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact  consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27--Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.     *No injuries reported.","Recommendations:  The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure defects such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     The Association of American Railroads (AAR) hazmat inspector (aka BOE inspector) will follow up to all Non Accident Releases (NAR) to assist hazmat shipper with regulatory requirements and training to help prevent recurrence of unsafe transportation conditions.

The driver was eastbound on I40, near Weatherford, Ok, at mile marker 80, when his unit drifted to the shoulder. When on the shoulder, the driver stayed there for about 120 feet and tried to pull back onto the highway. The driver turned his steering wheel to the left and when the unit re-entered the highway, the product surge in the tank caused his tank to move to the left. The driver tried to correct this action, but could not stop the movement of the trailer. The trailer continued to move to the left, towards the center medium and overturned, in the center medium. The truck and trailer rolled over onto the drivers side of the vehicle. The driver was able to evacuate the truck and begin calling 911. The Oklahoma Highway patrol arrived on the scene. The Weatherford Fire department responeded to the scene. Foam was put down around truck and trailer. Driver notified his supervisor. The driver noticed that the tank was leaking condensate, UN3295, and began building a dirt dike to contain the product. The Highway Patrol at that time notified Environmental Cleanup Inc., out of Oklahoma City,Ok to repond to the incident. The product leaked for about 1 to 2 hours, before the flow of product was stopped. When the tank overturned, the contact with the ground and the metal poles in the center medium, punctured the side of the trailer and product began to leak out. Dikes and bouy's were used to contain the product. Also another trailer, with a pump, was moved to location to vacuum up as much product as possible, while it was leaking. The hole on the trailer was about half way down the trailer on the left side.","Our company does yearly defensive driver training, but will ensure that re-entering the highway from the shoulder, will be emphazied.

The driver was not allowed on top of the cargo tank at that facility.  driver drove about 5 miles to a safe area and inspected the top of the trailer. Dog ears on dome were tight and there was no indication of any leakage.  When driver arrived at the consignee about 80 miles away, there was some product in the crash box and dripping down the drain tube.  In looking back on the roadway, there was a 1' by 150' trail from a rough area on the road.  When the dome on the cargo tank was opened, it was noted that the dome gasket was missing.  It was later found inside the cargo tank by the tankwash.  it appears it may have fallen in when the trailer was jarred on the roadway.  There was no indication of leakage before that.  We called out an enviromental firm to clean up the roadway.",Having the dome gasket fall into the cargo tank during transit is not a common occurence.  Not sure if it was not positioned properly or what may have caused the problem.

Surveys indicate no loose contamination above Department of Transportation limits, however there was a small amount visible resin on the trailer. Samples were collected and counted on a gamma spectroscopy.  The sample consisted of 450 ml of liquid with a very thin film layer of resin in the Sample container. The liquid sample was counted for two hours at EnergySolutions Bear Creek Lab. The results were Co-60 at 5.31E-8 µCi/ml, Cs-134 at 5.67E-8 µCi/ml, Cs-137 at 1.19E-7 µCi/ml. The shipment consisted of four 96 ft3 metal boxes inside a twenty foot  metal ISO container with a Type IP-1 rating for solid material only.

The contract responders inspecting GATX 17681 reported finding the manway closure was the source of a product leak and reported odor. Three of six manway securement bolts were found not tool tight. The nozzle style manway gasket applied was not fitting properly which prevented a good closure seal. The responders replaced the nozzle gasket with a Gore-Tex rope gasket at the manway lid.  The manway was closed and properly secured. New seal 162638 was applied at the manway. Spillage around the manway nozzle was sprayed with a Micro-Blaze solution.

The IBC was either hit hard by other freight that was staged in the trailer behind it or it was as a result from the driver slamming on his brakes causing the freight behind the IBC to hit and crush the protective cage around the IBC. When the protective cage was crushed and pushed in it caused a small crease in the plastic of the IBC resulting in a small hole which consequently contributed to the unintentional release. The hole was repaired in the IBC and the spilled material was neutralized and cleaned with sorbent material and placed into a recovery container.,"When loading freight into trailer material handlers need to make sure they do not slam the freight into freight that is already staged in the trailer.

The car was isolated and shipper, Targa Transport, was notified via CHEMTREC report #2012-06-30-00041. CSXT hazardous materials manager was dispatched to the scene and found the vapor valve to be in the open position and secondary closure plug to be less than tool tight. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to shipper representative David Lindow 713-826-2685. The open vapor valve and loose plug were secured and the car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move.

KIRK HIGBIE,DIRECTOR OF SAFETY & ENVIRONMENTAL,8934 MANCHESTER ST,HOUSTON,TX,77012-2149,Carrier,"On June 28, 2012 M&M Protection, LLC received a call from Kirk Higbie, Director of  Safety & Environmental for Port Terminal Railroad Association, who requested that M&M respond to a leaking rail car of Methyl Methacrylate Monomer at the Pasadena Yard, 910 N. Witter, Pasadena, Texas 77506, on track number 8.M&M personnel responded to the Port Terminal Railroad Association Pasadena Yard after receiving a call from Higbie regarding the rail car that appears to be leaking from the top of the car. Railcar number DOWX 74275 was located Additional M&M personnel arrived on location and Higbie was advised and a check was made to insure that the track was locked out and secure prior to the commencement of work. M&M personnel mounted the car and opened the protective dome lid. Inspection revealed that there was product leaking out of the 4” liquid valve. It was also observed that the 4” cap and both 2” caps were loose and camlock ears not secured. Upon removing of the liquid cap it was observed that the O-ring normally located inside the cap was too small for the cap. It was also observed that product was seeping out from around the Dri-  Disconnect Check Valve assembly just downstream of the liquid ball valve. M&M Personnel replaced the O-ring inside the cap; the decision was made to wait for the crew from DOW to see if replacing the valve in the field would be beneficial. The decision was made to have the car returned to DOWfor additional repairs as long as the product does not leak from the cap. 09:45, verbal authority was given by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to Port Terminal Railroad Association to transfer the rail car back to DOW for repairs. After receiving the authority to transport the car, the cap on top of the car was resealed and the protective dome was closed, resealed and prepared for transport.",Dow/Rohm & Haas is investigating the cause of the check valve and ball valve failure to prevent future occurrence.,No,,,111S100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1977,PORT TERMINAL RAILROAD ASSOCIATION (INC),US,

When processing the first car the operator opened the shell valve to relieve the stored pressure on the rail car and then proceeded to sample the rail car from the same valve.

Once impacted the operator went to the safety shower to flush the product off his body.

The operator soon observed asphalt leaking on top of the railcar. The operator immediately shut the pump down to stop further leaking of asphalt. Approximately 1 gallon (US) was released from the loading connection on the top of the railcar and some spilled product ran down the sides of the railcar. The cause of the release was a deteriorated gasket in-between the product hose connection and the railcar fitting/adapter. The release material (asphalt) cooled down which caused it to solidify and then it was able to be scooped up by shovel and asphalt was placed in a 5-gallon waste disposal bucket.,It was determined that a stronger type of gasket should be used for this transfer and that the terminal operator should ensure the gasket is replaced with a new gasket after every 3 railcars are loaded to reduce the chance that the gasket on the loading connection may fail again.,No,TANK CAR,Railroad tank car,TANK CAR,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Kinder Morgan Materials Services,US,

GESU 643503 was cordoned off and equipment was ordered to lift GESU 643503 from its position on the intermodal flatcar. GESU 643503 was grounded trackside by 0200 hrs. PDT, 6/24/2012 for a response contractor to investigate leak source and remediate spillage. Responders reported one 55 gallon steel drum near the container nose section was found leaking, apparently from abrasion to an upper rolling hoop that rubbed against the exterior metal cage of an IBC tote adjacent to the damaged drum. Insufficient blocking and bracing allowed lading inside GESU 643503 to move. The damaged drum was placed into an overpack drum, labeled and secured. The inside of GESU 643503 was cleaned and all lading was returned inside GESU 643503. An intermodal container riding under GESU 643503 was also grounded trackside and exterior spillage on it was cleaned. The rail flatcar was also cleaned of any observed spillage. GESU 643503 remained grounded at its location awaiting drayage into the port facility.  On June 29, 2012, GESU 643503 was reported emanating an odor, possibly from residue spillage from GESU 643503, which resulted in a response from local emergency agencies. No additional hazardous material packages were reported leaking. The ground surface under GESU 643503 was cleaned of any observed residue product, as well as, the exterior bottom of GESU 643503 by another response contractor. GESU 643503 was then drayed off property to the response contractor's facility for additional decontamination and the transfer of lading into another suitable intermodal container.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process includes adherence to acceptable containerized loading patterns with appropriate blocking and bracing to eliminate longitudinal and lateral lading shifts.,No,DRUM METAL,Non-removable head steel drum,1A1,No,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,55100,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The tanker built up pressure over the weekend due to the extreme heat and on Monday 06/25/12 the driver failed to fully depressurize it before going on his deliveries.  When the driver arrived at his first delivery he made a sudden stop at the guard gate causing the wave motion in the tanker.  This motion along with the pressure build up caused the ""pressure release valve"" to open and 3 gallons of bleach or ""sodium hypochlorite"" to run down the side of the tanker.  The guard called the fire department, who in turn called Mississippi EPA.

Received a call regarding a rolled over 2 ton, single bottle nurse tank. Houston Farmers Coop-east of garretson, Rock County MN. Tank started fishtailing, rolled over in ditch. Cty Rd 7/201st St. which is located 6 miles east of Hardwick and 1.5 miles NW of Kenneth. Road is currently closed.    Tank is upside down in ditch and leaking from the SRV.  NRC has been notified, Law enforcement has notified MN Duty Officer. Advised that we should also make a MN Duty Officer notification.    Fire Dept is on Scene and applying water. Wind is ~5mph out of the NW. The town of Kenneth would be downwind. Advised that the fire department would have Incident Command of the scene and that we should coordinate with them.     The SRV may be damaged or just releasing pressure.  However since the tank is upside down it is likely that liquid is being released and the pressure will not be decreasing.  They are making an attempt to upright the tank.  Our personnel have APR protection. Advised that an APR may be insufficient protection. Advised that if there is a risk that the Fire Dept should complete hookups using SCBA protection.    Sounds like with the wind and water application that the risk of inhalation exposure would be minimal from the upwind direction.     Advised that photographs be taken of the incident and of any damage prior to and after repairs. Location has the ability to transfer product once the tank has been uprighted. Advised the MDA will likely be requesting a followup investigation and documentation submittal.     They will keep me advised of the response and request any additional resources if needed.    4:21 update: Notified that as the tank was being uprighted the SRV valve blew. Fire dept likely will not have enough water to control plume.  Will initiate evacuation in the downwind direction.  Advised that with a 1"" hole the duration of the release will likely be short lived. No one injured. No one exposed. Advised that product may auto refrigerate and that once the tank warms vapors will be released if the hole is not plugged.     5:15 update: Tank is still leaking, Vapor valve was opened to relieve pressure. Fire department is in incident command all activities under their direction.  There is currently no evacuation being conducted.  The tank is a CHS owned tank with product being hauled out of our Magnolia location. NRC report number is 1013394.    7:27 update: Tank is upright and removed from the scene to a customers abandoned gravel pit.  Location is secure with fencing. Both the liquid and vapor valve assemblies sustained damage and still have the potential to actively leak.  The tank pressure is being taken away by bubbling in surface water at the gravel pit.  I requested that a water tank be used t",Employees must recieve yearly training on working with NH3 and understand hazards of pulling trailers which have a moving product and have an extremely high center of gravity due to how high the nurse tank sits on the running gear.

When the employee came to a stop, one cylinder rolled off the blades, rolled 6 feet and gently struck an overhead door post. The collision caused gas to leak from the valve area. When the event occurred, I was no more than 20 feet away. I immediately located the placarding on the cylinder to make sure it was non-flammable at the very least. I saw the 2.2 green diamond marking on the cylinder and next walked quickly to the employee to verify the type of gas on the BOL. I verified the gas was carbon monoxide (not an imminent threat) and made sure no one was near or would come near the immediate area. I instructed the employee to stay away from the shipment that was leaking, and wait for my return. I then walked quickly to the office to place the call to the provided number on the BOL, while beginning to search the ERG. The associate on the phone instructed no imminent threat and told me it would be safe to move the shipment outdoors to finish leaking. I returned to the cylinder, and was able to verify that the valve had become slightly opened upon impact. After tightening the valve, the leaking stopped completely and I verified no further damage. I saw that the weight on the bill was 450 LBS. on 5 cylinders, and knowing that cylinders weigh 90 LBS when empty, I concluded that they were mostly empty, and that a negligible amount of gas vapor had probably evaporated. We up righted the cylinder, and I instructed the employee about proper movement of the cylinders on the dock.

There is no dock at this customer location.  Therefore, the driver must position the IBC at the rear of the trailer so that the customer can remove with their fork-lift.  The driver moved the IBC to the rear of the trailer using an electric pallet jack. Driver failed to position the lift-gate as required to provide STOP barrier at the rear of the trailer.  The driver moved failed to properly judge the distance and the IBC was moved past the edge of the trailer floor.  The IBC then fell out of the trailer and onto the gravel parking lot below.  The poly IBC ruptured and cracked causing the entire contents to be released on the ground.  The contents were released in less than 10 minutes.  The release was immediately detected.  Grain Processing Corp personnel responded with in house resources and dike and contained the spill.  Lime was used to absorb the spill material.  Grain Processing setup proper disposal and of the spilled product and lime mixture through a contractor.       Note 1: The IBC was not available for inspection as Grain Processing took possession of the package.  This package is a rigid plastic IBC (UN31H1/Y) with structural equipment withstanding the stack load.  This IBC was manufactured by Snyder Industries.    Note 2: We were able to identify the IBC unit number assigned by Brenntag through our shipping paperwork.  Thus, we were able to track the last retest date of the container which was 03/05/2012.  We are unable to determine the manufacture date as we do not have possession of the IBC.  However, given the Brenntag unit number of 183900 that was assigned to this IBC we estimate the year of manufacture around Y2000 with an error of +/- 1 year.
