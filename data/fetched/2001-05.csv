AT THIS POINT IT WAS TOO LATE TO TURN INTO A NEARBY BP TRUCKSTOP LOCATED ON HWY . 24 WEST DRIVER CONTINUED ON FOR APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILES UNTIL AT THE INTERSECTION OF HWY .24 AND 48 HE WAS ABLE TO TURN AROUND AND RETURN TO THE BP TRUCKSTOP. IN THE TURNING AROUND PROCESS, LEAKING WHITE LIQUOR WAS RELEASED ONTO HWY 24. THE WHITE LIQUOR WAS ALSO RELEASED ONTO THE PARKING LOT OF THE BP TRUCKSTOP. THE DRIVER LOCATED AN AREA IN THE BACK PORTION OF THE PROPERTY WHICH THE DRIVER THOUGHT WAS SUITABLE TO STOP THE TRUCK AND GET ASSISTANCE FROM LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THE MCCOMB POLICE,  FIRE AND PIKE COUNTY CIVIL DEFENSE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A VALVE HAD FAILED RESULTING IN THE RELEASE. THE INITIAL AREA IN WHICH THE TANK WAS FIRST STOPPED WAS UNABLE TO CONTAIN THE RELEASE AND WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (MDEQ) EMERGENCY SERVICES BRANCH, MR. RICHARD COGHLAN, PIKE COUNTY CIVIL DEFENSE HAD THE TANK MOVED INTO A GRAVEL PIT WHERE THE REMAINDER OF THE LOAD RELEASED. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE RELEASE WAS 5000 GALLONS, OF WHICH 3000 GALLONS WAS ABLE TO BE RECOVERED.AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM FROM IMC CORPORATION WAS CALLED TO EVALUATE CONTAIN THE SPILL, AND DO THE CLEAN UP THE SPILL SITE. THE PRODUCT RELEASED ONTO HWY. 24 WAS NEUTRALIZED BY IMC AND DEEMED ACCEPTABLE BY MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (MDOT) DISTRICT 7. SOIL FROM THE INITIAL SPILL AREA AND IMPACTED SOIL DOWN SLOPE WAS NEUTRALIZED AND DUG UP BY IMC AND PLACED INTO A TREATMENT CELL TO BE NEUTRALIZED. THE NEUTRALIZATION PROCESS WAS PERFORMED BY IMC PERSONNEL AND OBSERVED BY MR. SHANNON LOWERY OF MDEQ, EMERGENCY SERVICES BRANCH. EARTH CON CONSULTING GROUP WAS CALLED AS A THIRD PARTY TO DO THE ANALYTICAL TESTING OF ALL AREAS IMPACTED BY THE RELEASE. IMC WITH THIS INFORMATION PROFILED THE SOIL INTO A NON-HAZARDOUS LANDFILL. THE SOIL HAS SINCE BEEN HAULED TO THE LANDFILL AND DISPOSED OF. EARTH CON WILL PROVIDE THE RESULTS OF ALL SAMPLING AND EACH AFFECTED PARTY WILL BE GIVEN A COPY OF SAID FINDINGS. THE CARGO TANK WAS RETURNED TO ITS TERMINAL WHERE AN INSPECTION WAS DONE TO FIND THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THERE HAD BEEN DEBRIS CAUGHT IN THE INTERNAL VALVE BODY SEAT, WHICH PREVENTED THE VALVE FROM CLOSING COMPLETELY. THIS ALLOWED PRODUCT TO FLOW INTO EXTERNAL PIPING WHICH WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PRODUCT CAUSING FAILURE OF THE PIPING AND SPILLAGE. THE VALVES AND PIPING WERE ALL REMOVED AND INSPECTED AND REPLACED WITH COMPATIBLE MATERIALS. ALL TANKS IN THIS SERVICE WERE REINSPECTED TO PREVENT THIS TYPE INCIDENT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

NEAR THE DESTINATION POINT, AT THE INTERSECTION OF MURRAY BOULEVARD AND BEARD ROAD, THE TRUCKS MADE A LEFT. THE OCCUPANTS OF THE TANDEM TRUCK, WHICH WAS THE LEAD TRUCK, NOTICED THAT THE BOX TRUCK HAD LOST SOME OF ITS CONTENTS. AFTER BOTH TRUCKS PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, TOM JONES RAN BACK TO DETERMINE WHAT OBJECTS FELL OUT OF THE BOX TRUCK AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS ONE PLANT AND A PLASTIC JUG. BEFORE TOM JONES COULD SAFELY REACH THE JUG A COUPLE OF CARS HIT THE JUG WHICH CAUSED IT TO ROLL AND BECOME PUNCTURED. THEN ANOTHER CAR RAN OVER THE JUG AND IT RUPTURED. TOM JONES INFORMED ALL OF THE OCCUPANTS OF BOTH TRUCKS THAT THERE WAS A HAZMAT SPILL. BOTH TRUCKS PROCEEDED TO MAKE THE DELIVERY AT THE OPRAH WINFREY SET. DURING THIS TIME, CHARLIE WIDENER, LOSS PREVENTION MANAGER AT THE TIGARD, OREGON LOWE'S STORE RECEIVED A CALL FROM LT.

WHEN I PULLED THE HOSE LOOSE FROM TANK #2 PRODUCT STARTED SPILLING OUT ONTO THE GROUND.  I IMMEDIATELY RAM BACK TO THE TRAILER TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE VALVES WERE NOT HOLDING.

KRAMER WENT BACK TO THE OFFICE TO REPORT THE SPILL TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES AND I BEGAN EXAMINING THE VALVE TO SEE WHY IT DID NOT HOLD.  AT THIS TIME I INSTALLED A NEW HYDRAULIC PUMP AT WHICH TIME THE HYDRAULIC VALVE CLOSED PROPERLY.  I THEN DRAINED THE REMAINDER OF THE PRODUCT FROM THE HOSE AND REMOVED IT FROM TRAILER 1088.
