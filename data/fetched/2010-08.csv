I traced the trailer and was unable to ascertain which of the~3 kinds of Flammable substances might be leaking , so I brought it to the dock. The substance p  ut off such~an obnoxious odor that I was forced to put the trailer back out to the yard.WE checked throughout the shift~and the odor never subsided. I contacted Roy Balentine before I left to advise him of the situation and get ~his recommendation.It was decided to leave the trailer in the yard over  night and reevaluate in the morning.~Upon unloading the trailer this morning it was determined the freight expanded due to heat and ruptured the~plastic containers and outer cardboard boxes.I have the skid of 45 ctns isolated in a trailer waiting on further instructions",Get with shipper and find out at what temp the substance starts boiling over.

The driver did not notice the spill at the time, and drove away.  Around 2200 on August 11, 2010, I received a call from Mark Kresovsky notifying me of the spill.  General Chemical personnel cleaned up the spill and we talked again around August 12,2010 at 0045.  The spill was contained and we would follow up the next morning.  NRC Evironmental Services came out the General Chemical around August 12, 2010 to finish the road clean up.  I met with Brian Hanson at General Chemical at 1615; NRC was still there completing the clean up.","Working with General Chemical, we are instituting a new procedure where the loader makes the driver go back up on top of the traile and double-check the dome before leaving their property.

A receptacle was placed under the BOV to catch drips. A BNSF contractor inspected NATX 29722 and reported that the BOV was in the closed position. The BOV was worked (open/closed) in an attempt to clear the valve seat of any contaminates. The BOC was loosened to inspect the BOC gasket condition. Once the BOC was loosened, product sprayed from its threaded connection into the receptacle under the BOV. The BOC was then tool tightened, stopping further product drips by 1100 hrs. CDT, 8/10/2010. The BOV was presumed faulty, as it was allowing product to by-pass this closed valve. NATX 29722 was monitored and no further product drips from the BOC were observed. Captured spillage evaporated. The shipper requested and was granted FRA-10080489 movement authority to redirect NATX 29722 back to its loading origin for product off-loading, thence to a qualified repair facility for BOV repairs.

As the material flowed to the rear of the rear most trailer, it spilled out the bottom right corner and splashed upon another CMV as it was passed by the FedEX CMV. The second CMV driver then passed the FedEX CMV and motioned for him to pull to the shoulder. (The damage to the second CMV included varnish of the front and sides of the truck tractor and on the windshield).The Marshall Fire Department and the Illinois State Police were contacted and the right lane of I70 near Milepost 144 was closed off to traffic. Upon my arrival, I found the material leaking at a rate of approximately 1 gallon per minute. The material had leaked through the front of the trailer but most of the material was leaking at the rear right side of the trailer. The trailer was disconnected from the other units and the fire department had a water line at the ready. Westbound traffic was moved over to the far left shoulder and allowed to continue. A Haz Mat cleanup crew was arranged for by the carrier and as we waited for their arrival, the temperature of the trailer show 118 degrees Fat the lower right front corner of the trailer. The pavement under the trailer showed a temperature of 125 degrees F. Upon the arrival of the Haz Mat crew, the spilled material on the ground was neutralized with dry powder. Dry powder was also used to neutralize the spilled material in the trailer. According to Matt SMITH (Spill Recover Of Indiana), one of the four 55 gal drums split at the bottom.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder was notified and inspected these tank cars during daylight. Responder's inspection revealed that GATX 68560 (DOT 111A100W1 tank car) had a product trail on the top shell emanating from this tank car's manway closure. A piece of a manway gasket was found stuck atop the tank shell near than manway nozzle. The shipper seal on the manway cover (Valero Inc 081545) was intact. Responder found 4 of 6 manway securement bolts less than tool tight. Inspection of the manway gasket condition revealed no manway gasket in place. The responder applied a new manway gasket and properly tool tightened all six manway securement bolts. Spillage on the shell of GATX 68560 had cooled and hardened. No ground impact from spillage was observed. Another identical shipment in tank car GATX 68572 nearby was inspected and also found with 4 of 6 manway securement bolts less than tool tight.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Berryman Chemical, was notified via CHEMTREC (Report # 2010-08-18-00140). Product was found leaking from a plug where the internal heater coil stubout had been sealed. Unable to stop the leak, a hazmat hammock was deployed and used to capture the leaking product. The issue was communicated to the shipper's representative, Wendy Berryman, 713-520-0805 and the product was transferred to trucks for delivery.     This incident did require a special switching move.  A QA 7.1 Nonconformance Report is not required for this incident.

The railcar was pressurized and the product valve was opened to fill Univar sodium hydroxide tanks.  While transloading, a Univar approved carrier arrived around 6am to load for a customer needing sodium hydroxide.  The tanker was backed into position and handlers began loading the tanker.   While transloading into the tanker, a handler noticed product squirting out of the 2"" female hose cam ears. This hose was attached to railcar.  At this point the railcar product valve was shut and they closed all connections from the railcar.   After cleaning up the 100 gallons of sodium hydroxide we disconnected the hose that was attached to the railcar and attached to Univar railstand and found no 2"" gasket was in the female end of the hose. This allowed sodium hydroxide to squirt out the cam ears of Univar hose. After reviewing the incident with Safety Committee, it was determined the gasket missing from the 2"" hose was the reason the product was release out of hose cam ears.       All material was pumped out of the rail line and drain blocks were put down in case we had any more material release from railcar.  Univar OM is self contained with gate valve on property.  At no time did sodium hydroxide get into the sewer system and all sodium hydroxide was pumped into disposable tote.","Bulk handlers who will deal with connecting, disconnecting, loading and transferring of railcars or tankers will need to connect equipment and 2nd handler will need to verify connections are complete and no issues with any area of the hoses, railcar or tank truck.

BNSF contract responders inspected the lading inside JBHU 239625 finding a 30 gallon poly drum loaded atop a wooden pallet toward the container's nose was leaking contents. Closer inspection revealed that two protruding pallet nails rubbed against the drum's bottom causing abrasion holes allowing product to leak out. Responders overpacked this leaking drum and placed absorbant materials on the floor spillage inside JBHU 239625. Afterwards, all spillage was diluted and removed. Spillage on the outside of JBHU 239625 and on the J.B. Hunt's tractor was diluted and cleaned.

A BNSF mechanical/hazardous material responder immediately inspected NATX 16168 finding product trail evidence that the BOV flange plate connection to the tank car (belly flange) was the leak source. The responder tool tightened one mounting flange hex bolt approximately 3/4 turn and also the two hex bolts adjacent on either side slightly. Afterwards, no further product drips were observed. All shipper seals were intact and all other valves/fittings were found secure. The dried crystallized product residue on the underside of NATX 16168 was diluted with neutralizing solution. Response was concluded by 1530 hrs. CDT, 8/30/2010.   The side specification stencil on NATX 16168 indicated that its last tank qualification was completed in the year 2005 and next due in 2015.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The vessel unloading operations were stopped until the response contractor could attend to the spill that was on the vessel in the hole of the ship.  This required removing and reworking the leaking container along with neutralizing and cleaning the container below it as well as the vessel hole as well.  The product leaking was UN1789, Hydrochloric Acid, 8 PGII that was in 38 Residue, Last Contained Empty Totes.  The USCG was present and contacted PHMSA.  The unloading and reworking of the containers took place under the view of the USCG and PHMSA.  The composite totes had a metal frame around the plastic container.  The metal plate on the bottom of the tote prevented the contractor or anyone from making a firm determination as to the cause of the leak.

The failure was at the fifth wheel connection between the tractor and the tanker. This failure resulted in the tanker separating from the tractor. The right side of the front end of the tanker sustained a six inch gash after the tanker separated from the tractor unit. Approximately 1,962 gallons of gasoline were released from the tanker and spilled onto soil and an asphalt parking lot. The Summit and Forest View Fire Departments, in cooperation with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD), then diluted and washed the gasoline down a nearby storm drain which connects to the MWRD sewage treatment plant. The tanker involved in the incident contained approximately 8,404 gallons of product. A product recovery tanker was provided by Klemm Tank Lines and dispatched to the site. Approximately 6,442 gallons of product was transferred from the Z&K fuel Transport tanker into the recovery tanker provided by Klemm Tank Lines. Bills of lading were utilized to determine the approximate 1,962 gallons of product which was released from the tanker due to the incident.     On August 9,2010, at approximately 1000 CST Z&K Fuel Transport contacted HazChem in order to perform emergency response and remediation activities on its behalf of Z&K Fuel Transport. At approximately 1144 CST, Z&K Fuel Transport contacted Emergency Response and Training Solutions (ERTS) to manage and oversee environmental operations on Z&K Fuel Transport's behalf.     Pursuant to Illinois State regulations, ERTS notified the Illinois Emergency Management Agency. The IEMA issued report number H2O10-0872 to this report. IEMA was also notified by Summit Fire Department and report number H2010-0868. The National Response Center (NRC) was notified of the incident as well.  NRC assigned incident report number 950328 to the incident. The Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (MWRD) was notified of the incident and a report number was not available at the time of this report.     On August 9, 2010, HazChem arrived on site and worked in conjunction with Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) personnel to secure and contain the site. HazChem personnel utilized a vacuum truck to collect a mixture foam, water, and gasoline which had accumulated in local sewer lines due to emergency response efforts of local fire departments. Approximately 300 gallons of contaminated liquid were removed from the sewer lines. Granular absorbent was utilized along with street sweeper equipment in order to collect the released materials from the asphalt parking lot. The area of asphalt parking lot measured approximately 150' by 100'.  All granular absorbent material was containerized for transportation and proper disposal.     Additional response measures were pursued by HazChem personnel to an area of soil immediately adjacent to the parking lot. HazChem pe","  • The subject fifth wheel is a JOST model number JSK37VSLB7PG12, herein referred to as the “fifth wheel”.    • The fifth wheel has gouge marks on its top face consistent with a trailer kingpin separation and subsequent detachment.  The trailer glad-hand and power connection have damage to them consistent with an unintended trailer separation.  The tractor rear axle outer dually tire has a puncture and tread damage consistent with being impacted by the trailer after the separation.      • The trailer tires are all intact.    • The fifth wheel was acuated with a JOST test kingpin and the lock-bar did not fully engage.  Further the handle lock did not engage.  The test kingpin was loose in the fifth wheel due to the failure of the lock-bar and handle lock to engage.     • The fifth wheel was used to connect to an actual trailer kingpin and the same locking failure was seen.    • The observed fifth wheel locking mechanism abnormality is consistent with the trailer separation incident that occurred on 8/9/10 at Rt. 171 and Archer Ave.      • The specific cause of the fifth wheel locking mechanism abnormality is currently under investigation by SEA Project Engineer David Stobbe, P.E., IL License No. 062061985.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,140000,ERTS,US,

HOKX 8283 was isolated in the railyard with containment placed under it. Contract responders applied lime to neutralize product impacted ground areas, and later excavated impacted ground gravel.  Excavated material was profiled for final disposal. Arrangements for transferring remaining product from HOKX 8283 to another suitable tank car (HOKX 8338) were finalized. Product transfer was completed without incident by 1500 hrs. CDT, 8/09/2010. Afterwards, the interior of HOKX 8283 was neutralized and cleaned of product residue with a water/soda ash solution. A liner failure near the welded sump area at the bottom end of the liquid eduction dip tube was suspected as the cause of the tank corrosion hole.

GATX 23423 was cordoned-off. The BNSF employee was taken to a local hospital for examination and treatment for chemical inhalation exposure. The employee was examined, provided oxygen and aspirin; and released without further treatment. BNSF and contract responders inspected GATX 23423 finding all valves and fittings secure, but evidence of product leaking from the manway closure was observed. It was concluded that the manway gasket was the cause of the product release since all the manway securement bolts were tool tight. The shipper was notified and sent responders to assess the condition of GATX 23423. The shipper responders initiated air monitoring procedures findings no recordable readings at or atop GATX 23423. The manway was opened and responders reported that the manway gasket was missing. The product outage was deemed appropriate. The responders installed a new manway gasket and resecured the manway cover prior to 1013 hrs. MDT, 8/19/2010. GATX 23423 was then scheduled to return to the shipper to clean the dried spillage off its tank shell.","Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings, including all securement components are applied correctly and in place.",No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,1200,BNSF Railway Company,US,

He placed a bucket under the spill, then climbed to the top of the tanker and noticed the leak was coming from the threads on the pressure relief valve of compartment 2. Driver bled the pressure off the compartment, when there was no pressure the leak stopped and Driver tightened the entire pressure relief valve assembly ¼ turn. Less than 1 liter of product had leaked unto the ground, Driver notified Darigold receiver Lorenzo. Driver and receiver removed product from ground using absorbent pads till pavement was dry. No product reached the drain. Driver contacted Supervisor Jeunene Petitte via phone call at time of incident.  When ready to unload compartment, he ran the customers airline to the trailer, hooked it up and unloaded the compartment into customer’s tank. The product did not leak after tightening the pressure relief valve. It was found that the material handler while loading the tanker, had removed the pressure relief valve to connect a fitting on the tanker for top loading. When replacing the pressure relief valve, it was hand tightened. Also, the tanker volumetrically appeared to be overloaded, causing the product to drip from threads of pressure relief valve.","New couplers will added to the blind flanges of tanker 07 to attach top load fittings.

UNPX 120334 was cordoned-off during assessment by BNSF mechanical and operating responders. Apparently, the hopper #3 outlet's locking device (elbow hinged style) vibrated to a non-locking position which allowed product to escape from the bottom outlet. Also noted was that the support bar for the hopper #3 outlet was bent. This support bar defect appeared to be old damage. The bend in the support bar may have contributed to the hopper outlet #3's door hinge locking device from staying in the secured locked position. BNSF mechanical responders were able to close the outlet, relock and secure UNPX 120334's hopper outlet #3's locking device. A contractor vacuumed all visible ground spillage.

While the material handler was securing the trailer with a jack-stand and glad handle at approximately 5:30 PM, they noticed liquid dripping from the trailer.  The material handler immediately notified the supervisor of the leak.  The supervisor pulled the paperwork and determined the leaking material was a Hazardous Waste Liquid that contained PCBs.  The supervisor had the material handler place collection buckets under the trailer to catch any dripping liquid.  The supervisor then notified Veolia EHS Manager, John Hannah and Jim Easter at approximately 6:00 PM.      Upon inspection of the trailer, the supervisor noticed many drums that were leaking, but he could not inspect all the drums without offloading them.  The most suspect drum was a 55-gallon drum that has a clear plastic lid cover on it.  The floor around this drum was saturated with liquids.  Prior to offloading the drums, a double layer of poly-sheeting was placed on dock area and Row 23A.  Approximately 100’ of boom was placed around the poly-sheeting to create a curb to prevent any liquid run-off.  The drums were broken off of the pallets and off-loaded one at a time.  The pallets were very saturated with liquid material.  As the drums were off-loaded, numerous drum lids were replaced because they did not seal.  The offloading of the trailer was completed at approximately at 5:30 AM on August 11, 2010.  The plastic and PPE generated during the offloading were consolidated into three 55-gallon poly drums.","The drums from manifest 007457673JJK were inspected on August 11, 2010 and it was determined that the 55-gallon containers were not DOT shippable for various reasons such as:  1. Some containers did not have UN-Markings  2. Some drums had waste on the exterior of the container  3. Some of the drums were damaged and had questionable integrity    The total number of containers that needed to be overpacked was 31 drums.  The drums were overpacked into new UN-rated 851A2 containers.  All the clean-up material and debris associated with the spill were packaged into six (6) un-rated cubic yard boxes and four (4) un-rated 55-gallon drums.  The clean-up materials were shipped to Veolia's Port Arthur facility on manifest 000488227VES.    Veolia was not the intial shipper or generator of the materials.  Veolia assumed transportion responsibility when the intial transporter transfered contol to Veolia at our West Carrollton, OH facility.  In an attempt to prevent a reoccurance, Veolia notified the generator and the intial transporter of the incident.",No,DRUM METAL,Removable head steel drum,1A2,No,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,28000,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

This account of the accident may not be factual based on relative information not being available.  Driver was heading south on I77 South out of Charlotte at approx. 2:40PM on August 16th and had just passed the Gold Hill Exit in Ft. Mill, SC when a car pulled over into the right side of our truck causing him to swerve over into the left lanes eventually hitting the concrete median seperating the north and southbound lanes and causing the unit to rollover on on its right side and onto the car that pulled over into him. The unit slid on its right side and caught fire completely destroying the trailer to the point where the only thing left was the rear tandem and the tractor was down to engine and frame only.  The were no identifing marks on the unit so we did not have a positive notification of the incident till around 9PM. The driver and a passenger of the other vehicle were pulled to safety by a passing motorist and were treated and released at a local hospital.  Our Driver suffered a fatal injury during the crash before the unit caught fire.  Most of the product burned but some product did flow into the drainage system under the interstate and into a nearby creek.  Hazardous Materials crews placed underflow dams in the creek to prevent further spread of the material and utilized vacuum truck and absorbant booms and pads to recover the material in the creek. The concrete culverts on the side of the interstate where the material flowed down to the creek caught fire and received extensive damage along with the ajoining woods.  Interstate 77 was closed for approx. 6 hours  before it was reopened to traffic on the southbound side.  A section of pavement approx 80 foot long had to be replaced.  We are working with the SCDOT on their requirements for restoring the general area.  We have also submitted a work plan to the SCDHEC on the environmental work needed. They had some additional requirements and we are awaiting their response to determine the scope of the remaining project.","Continue training on safe driving with a focus of defensive drving skills and techniquesw and crash advoidance.  Make sure Drivers are trained in special-handling characteristics, including high center of gravity,fluid loads subject to surge and effects of surge on braking.

While travelling on Interstate 80 westbound near mile marker 187, the Vickery Transportation, Inc. tractor-trailer unit rolled-over.  Apparently the roll-over occurred as a result of the driver falling asleep.  The accident resulted in damage to the tanker, resulting in the release of approximately 3229 gallons of material.  The Ohio State Police, Streetsboro Fire Department, Ohio Department of Transportation and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency responded to assess the site.  Sunpro, Inc. of North Canton, Ohio was dispatched to perform the cleanup.  Sunpro, Inc. utilized a vacuum truck to recover approximately 671 gallons of material from the damaged tanker.  Sunpro, Inc. also utilized the vacuum truck to recover approximately 2843 gallons of material from the impacted ditch line.  The liquid waste was transported to Vickery Environmental, Inc. in Vickery, Ohio for disposal.  Sunpro, Inc. excavated approximately 236.51 tons of contaminated soil over a period of several days.  The solid waste was transported to Waste Management Landfill in Canton, Ohio for disposal. On Tuesday, August 24, 2010, Sunpro, Inc. returned to the site and removed approximately 8261 gallons of waste water from the ditch line, per request of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.","Since the release was accidental, no plans currently exist to prevent recurrence.

When the operations crew arrived on the morning of August 17th, they thought the rail car had been unloaded and was ready to be moved to another track position. In the process of moving the rail car, the two inch top loading valve was torn off the rail car resulting in a spill of potassium hydroxide. The safety access ramp and tank car unloading arm were damaged as well. After approximately twenty minutes when it was safe to access the top of the rail car, the bleeder valve was opened thereby depressurizing the rail car and stopping the release. An environmental cleanup crew was dispatched and cleanup commenced immediately. An environmental remediation crew was also dispatched. Clean-up and neutralization commenced immediately.","1.

The driver did not remember leaving the road, and the cause of his condition and the incident is still under investigation.  The driver was removed from the vehicle and ultimately taken to an Oklahoma City hospital for treatment of injuries.                                                                                                 The vehicle and trailer came to rest in the creek bed.  The trailer remained intact and no crude oil was released to the creek.  There was no failure of the crude oil trailer transportation packaging.  Upon impact in the creek bed, the tractor was heavily damaged.  Engine oil and diesel fuel leaked out of the vehicle and entered the water in the creek.  At the time of the incident, there was little to no flow in the creek so the oil was contained in the immediate area of the accident.  A contract response company responded to the incident site and contained and removed all oil using sorbent pads and booms.  A small amount of oil-stained soil was also removed from the site.  In total, we estimate less than 20 gallons of engine oil and fuel were leaked out of the vehicle over a few hours.  The crude oil was pumped out of the tanker and removed from the site. After removal of the crude from the transport, the tractor, trailer and all debris were removed from the site.","It is BKEP's belief that vehicle accidents occur as a result of 1) equipment failure, 2) driver error/behavior issue, or 3)driver medical condition/issue.  At this time, we have eliminated equipment failure as the cause of the accident.  Therefore, we believe that the accident was caused by driver error, driver medical condition, or combination of the two.  Due to the nature and extent of his injuries, we have not been able to conduct a thorough and complete interview with the driver nor have we obtained a complete record of his doctor's medical findings.  This information is necessary to determine the cause of the accident. We are working to gather this information from the driver and his doctor to better understand what happened to the employee immediately before he lost control of the vehicle (i.e.,medically), and understand how these conditions may have contributed to the accident.  We are also evaluating other potential contributing factors such as prescription medications taken by the driver.  Our Trucking Operations Manager will be gathering this information from the driver and his doctor to review with our internal Incident Investigation Team, and we will provide an update to you as the root cause of the accident and appropriate corrective measures to prevent reoccurrence are developed more clearly.  We expect this information will be collected within the next two to three weeks, and an update can be provided soon thereafter.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,61000,"BKEP CRUDE, LLC",US,

The railcar liners is a woven fabric with a polymer applied on inside and outside of the liner during manufacturing.  The installed liner covers all interior surfaces of the railcar for the transloading operations. The liners closed and secured after transloading to fully cover and enclose the transloaded soils for rail shipment.    After transloading and closing the liners it was observed that an unidentified liquid was leaking from drip holes on the bottom of several railcars.  When this drippage was discovered buckets were placed to collect the liquid for proper disposal.  Absorbants were added to the collected liquids.    In total 32 manifested truck loads were transloaded into a total of 8 railcars during the two day period of August 23 and 24.  All 8 railcars developed the weepage of liquids within 2 days of being loaded.  The 8 original railcars were transloaded into a second set of 8 railcars with two liners between August 28 and September 1.  5 of the 'new' railcars developed similar weepage of liquids beginning on September 3.  Product from these 5 railcars was again transloaded into other railcars with 3 liners and 4,000# of absorbant mixed into the soils during transloading.  The second transloading of the soils was performed between September 10 and 16.  No weepage of liquids has been observed from the railcars transloaded between Sept 10 and 16.

NEWTON,DIRECTOR SAFETY & COMPLIANCE,820 Shades Creek Parkway Suite 2000,BIRMINGHAM,AL,35209,Carrier,"Driver was exiting I-65 North at mile marker 22 in Tennessee.  Exit ramp is of a clover leaf design.  Tractor and tank left continued straight through the curve of the exit ramp, continued across an open grassy area, and then crossed over the adjacent northbound entrance ramp to I-65 North where tractor and tank struck Ford explorer traveling on entrance ramp.  Both vehicles came to rest along side of north bound entrance ramp against embankment.  Collision resulted in tank disconnecting from tractor.  Tank was ruptured by tractor when it disconnected causing hole in lower portion of tank approximately 5 inches in diameter.  Product leaked until it was below the hole.  Product was naturally contained below the tank in a ditch.  Product stayed contained due to ditch sloping inward toward and under the tanker.  There was no release to a water supply or onto the road.  Product stayed contained within a 100 foot are.  Response crew contained product to the crash scene and pumped approximately 23,000 pounds from the ground into another tanker.  Another approximate 7,000 pounds was pumped from damaged tanker into another tanker. That left approximately 18,000 that was waste hauled.  The crash took place at 0716 hours in the morning and all product but approximately 4,000 pounds was cleaned up at 2300 hours that night.  Area was cordoned off and the remaining approximate 4,000 punds was cleane up the next morning before 1000 hours.  Some earth was damaged and required two dump trucks of top soil and hay and seed.","The driver was hired 08/23/2010 and the accident occurred 08/23/2010.  Therefore, he had been driving for Nelson Brothers, LLC for less than seven days.  This was his second dispatch.  He had already made one run on a similar route.  In investigating the accident, the driver made the statement that he ""messed up"" by not realizing he was that far in to the turn when he looked back to his co-driver to tell him to wake up to change out.  And, at that point it was too late, as he states, to try to stay in the curve so he rode it out straight through the curve and tried to control the tractor and trailer instead of taking the chance of rolling it.  We can use this incident and how it happened for future training of drivers.  We are scheduling an accident re-construction and will evaluate other prevention action items once it is complete.  The driver was terminated from employment with Nelson Brothers, LLC for being at fault.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,203000,"Nelson Brothers, LLC",US,

THE EVASIVE ACTION TAKEN BY THE CLEAN HARBOR'S DRIVER RESULTING IN THE VEHICLE VEERING ONTO THE SOFT SHOULDER OF THE ROADWAY WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY THREE FEET IN WIDTH LEADING TO A STEEP EMBANKMENT.  THE FORWARD MOMEMTUM OF THE VEHICLE CAUSED THE UNIT TO SLIDE OFF THE ROADWAY AND DOWN THE EMBANKMENT.

Jaime Pacheco took the call and informed me (Ken) of the accident. I went to the sight and upon arrival saw the truck turned over laying in the north barrow ditch. Armando, the driver, was in the Key truck with the DPS officer and was in good condition with no cut or scrapes. Had refused to go to the Hobbs hospital but had been checked out by the Ambulance service and later had told me he had blacked out so I told him he needed to go to a hospital and get checked out for sure incase of any internal damage. Danny Williams the RSS Salesman was also at the sight and I had asked him to take Armando to Artesia Hospital and also wait with him until his release and until our safety man Charlie Bishop arrive to drug test him. He came Out with a clean bill of health and was given some pain meds for bumps and post accident aches.   Meanwhile at the accident sight we looked over everything while waiting for other emergency crews to arrive that the NMHP had called. The transport tanker was laying on its side and was leaking acid out of the front compartment hatch, about a pencil thick stream. The truck had 1000 gal acid a 90/10 blend with xylene. NMHP had called the Hazardous Response team to the sight and about this time the Fire Chief showed up on location and was put in charge. I was told to find a company to suck   the acid from the truck which we contacted Macklasky (SP) who showed up about 5:00pm. The Haz-mat clew showed up about 30mm prior. An evaluation from the Haz-mat team was made and a plan was devised. From this point on the Haz-mat team looked as if they didnt have a clue the rest of the night.",DRIVERS WILL GO THROUGH AN ADDITIONAL DEFENSIVE DRIVING CLASS AND WE WILL STRESS AGAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF PAYING ATTENTION AT ALL TIMES WHEN DRIVING.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,94729,RISING STAR SERVICES,US,

The contents of the trailer were consumed in the ensuring fire that was allowed to “burn off” the hydrogen remaining in the trailer.   The incident involved hose rupture connecting a trailer at a customer site that is used to maintain a continuous supply to a customer. Continuous supply is maintained by having one trailer connected as a supply source while the second trailer is being refilled. During the delivery of a refilled trailer to the customer, the refilled trailer is connected to a customer prior to isolating and disconnecting the trailer that is in service at the customer.   In this incident, the refilled trailer had just been connected to the customer pressure reducing station and the second trailer was in the process of being disconnected for return and refilling. While disconnecting the second trailer the driver heard an unusual sound from the direction of the recently connected trailer. Before he was able to investigate the source of the sound, there was an explosive ignition followed by a fire.   There was no breach of any of the cylinders comprising the tube trailer, nor did the rupture discs on any of the manifolded tubes function during the ensuing fire. The hose was not equipped with excess flow devices and, as a result, non-metallic components of hose were consumed in the fire.
