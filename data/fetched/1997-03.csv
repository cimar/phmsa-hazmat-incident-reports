THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED AT APPROXIMATELY 05:45 ON 03/1/1997.  THE DRIVER WAS ENCOUNTERING HEAVY FOG.  HE DROPPED THE TIRES, ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE UNIT, OFF OF THE PAVED ROADWAY.  THE TRACTOR HIT A GUARDRAIL, THE TRAILER HIT A CONCRETE DRAINAGE WALL AND BECAME DISCONNECTED FROM THE TRACTOR. THE TRACTOR OVERTURNED ON THE SHOULDER OF THE ROADWAY AND THE TRAILER CAME TO REST IN AN OPEN FIELD ADJACENT TO THE ROADWAY.  THE TRAILER CONTAINED ONLY A RESIDUAL AMOUNT OF HELIUM.  THE TRAILER IS VACUUM JACKETED.  TNE N2 DEVERTER HOUSING ON THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER WAS DAMAGED AND CAUSED A LOSS OF VACUUM ON THE VESSEL.  WHEN THE  VACUUM WAS LOST, THE RESIDUAL PRODUCT INSIDE THE INNER VESSEL STARTED TO WARM UP.  LIQUID HELIUM IS -452.7 DEGREES F.  THE LOSS OF VACUUM AND THE WARMING OF THE PRODUCT CAUSE THE PRESSURE TO RISE IN THE INNER VESSEL.  THE INNER VESSEL WAS NOT RUPTURED. BEFORE THE SAFETY RELIEF DEVICE ACTIVATED, THE DRIVER OPENED THE MANUAL VENTING SYSTEM AND VENTED THE REMAINING RESIDUAL HELIUM TO THE ATMOSPHERE. THE VENTING BY THE DRIVER WAS A CONTROLLED RELEASE.  AFTER THE TRAILER REACHED ZERO PRESSURE, IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE HIGHWAY RIGHT OF WAY. THERE WAS DAMAGE TO THE GUARDRAIL, ESTIMATED AT $3500.00.  NO FLUIDS WERE LOST FROM THE TRACTOR (IE: FUEL, OIL, ANTIFREEZE).  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, THE POLICE WERE NOTIFIED BY THE DRIVER VIA CELLULAR TELEPHONE. THE DRIVERS WERE NOT INJURED.  THE DRIVER WAS WEARING A SEATBELT.  THE POLICE ARRIVED JUST MINUTES AFTER THE ACCIDENT.  THE FOLLOWING WEEK WE HELD A SAFETY MEETING AT THE HOME TERMINAL OF THE DRIVER.  THIS ACCIDENT WAS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL.  WE ALSO VIDEO TAPED A PRESENTATION OF THE ACCIDENT SO THAT ALL DRIVERS WILL BE INFORMED.

ON THE MORNING OF MARCH 6, 1997, N&M TRANSFER EXPERIENCED A 300 GALLON CHEMICAL SPILL THAT RESULTED FROM A CRACKED VALVE ON A DOT EXEMPTION TANK (DOT E-9150). THIS TANK WAS ORIGINALLY PICKED UP BY N&M TRANSFER FROM THE SHIPPER (CHASKA CHEMICAL, SAVAGE, MN). THE TANK WAS LOADED BY AN EMPLOYEE OF CHASKA CHEMICAL AT THE TIME OF PICK UP. IT WAS HAULED TO N&M TRANSFER, NEEMAH, WI, IN THE SAME TRAILER. ** OUR RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE TANK ARRIVED SAFELY AND INTACT AND THAT IT WAS SAFELY PLACED ON OUR DOCK FOR ONLY 1-3 HOURS BEFORE ANOTHER DOCKMAN ATTEMPTED TO PICK IT UP FOR LOADING. OUR INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT AFTER PROPERLY INSERTING THE FORKS IN THE SLOTTED FORK GROOVES ON THE BOTTOM OF THE TANK, OUR DOCKMAN BEGAN LIFTING THE TANK OFF OF THE CONCRETE DOCK FLOOR. JUST MOMENTS AFTER PICKING UP THE TANK THE VALVE CRACKED AND THE CONTENTS BEGAN POURING OUT. STATEMENTS BY EMPLOYEES IN THE AREA NOTED THAT AT NO TIME WAS THE VALVE HIT BY THE DOCKMAN. SHORTLY AFTER THE LEAKAGE BEGAN ANOTHER DOCKMAN ATTEMPED TO TILT THE TANK TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF SPILLAGE. THE TILTING OF THE TANK CAUSED A RUPTURE IN THE BACK MID POINT OF THE TANK, WHICH RESULTED IN THE COMPLETE SPILLAGE OF TANK CONTENTS WITHIN MINUTES AFTER THE INITIAL VALVE CRACKING. ** EMERGENCY PERSONNEL FROM THE TOWN OF NEENAH FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE WINNEBAGO COUNTY HAZ/MAT TEAM WERE NOTIFIED AND ON THE SCENE WITHIN THE HOUR. THE WISCONSIN DNR WAS ALSO NOTIFIED. A PRIVATE REMEDIATION CONTRACTOR WAS CALLED IN TO COMPLETE BY 2:30 P.M. ** THE SPILLED MATERIAL WAS CONFINED TO AN AREA OF ABOUT 50' BY 40' N&M TRANSFER EMPLOYEES USED GRANDULATED DRI-ZORB, PADS, PILLOWS, AND DIAPERS (CARGO) TO CONTAIN THE SPILL. THE DOCK SUPERVISOR ON DUTY IMMEDIATELY ORDERED YARDMEN TO BEGIN PULLING TRAILERS OUT OF THE DOCK SO THAT PROPER VENTILATION COULD BE ATTAINED. (THIS BUILDING IS A CROSS DOCK OPERATION). ALL EMPLOYEES (OTHER THAN FOREMAN AND SUPERVISORS) WERE EVACUATED FROM THE BUILDING WITHIN 15 MINUTES OFTHE SPILL. NINE DOCK EMPLOYEES WERE TRANSPORTED TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR OBSERVATION ONLY. ANOTHER NINE DOCK EMPLOYEES WERE TRANSPORTED IN THEIR OWN PERSONAL VEHICLES FOR OBSERVATION ONLY. ** ON TUESDAY MARCH 18TH, N&M TRANSFER REQUESTED A MEETING WITH THE TOWN OF NEENAH FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE INCIDENT COMMANDER FROM THE WINNEBAGO COUNTY HAZ/MAT TEAM. DURING THIS MEETING WE EVALUATED HOW THE SPILL WAS HANDLED BY THESE AGENCIES AND BY N&M TRANSFER EMPLOYEES. AS A RESULT OF THIS MEETING, N&M TRANSFER IS CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THE FEASIBILITY AND COSTS OF USING A CONTAINMENT TYPE SYSTEM CAPABLE OF HOLDING BULK QUANTITIES OF SPILLED HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. WE ARE ALSO REVIEWING THE COSTS AND RISKS INVOLVED BY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS (E.G. CORROSIVES, FLAMMABLE, POISONS). DURING OUR ANNUAL SUPERVISORY HAZ/MAT RE-TRAINING WE WILL ALSO DISCUSS THIS SPILL IN DETAIL. ** I HAVE INCLUDED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONTAINER (TANK) IN QUESTION, ALONG WITH PHOTOS OF THE SPILL SCENE AND CLEAN UP OPERATIONS.

I AND THE REST OF THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WERE NOTIFIED BY PAGER OF A TRUCK PARKED IN THE RAINBOW CASINO TRUCK PARKING LOT, LEAKING SOME TYPE OF LIQUID PRODUCT.  WHILE I WAS ENROUTE FROM MY HOME, I MADE CONTACT BY RADIO WITH FIRE CHIEF JEFF KNUDTSON.  HE STATED THAT THE PRODUCT WAS AN UNKNOWN LIQUID LEAKING FROM A METAL CONTAINER PLACARDED AS A HAZARDOUS WASTE.  AT THIS POINT THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE THE DRIVER. UPON MY ARRIVAL AT 0130 HRS, I MET WITH CHIEF KNUDTSON. I WAS SHOWN THE TRUCK THAT WAS LEAKING.  I NOTICED THAT SOME LIQUID PRODUCT HAD LEAKED OUT OF THE RIGHT FRONT CORNER OF THE FIRST CONTAINER, RAN DOWN THE PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF THE TRUCKERS LOUNGE AND INTO THE STREET GUTTER AND THEN DOWN THE STORM DRAIN.  THE PLACARDS ON BOTH THE CONTAINERS ON THE TRUCK SHOWED THAT THE TRUCK WAS HAULING HAZARDOUS WASTE. THE AREA AROUND THE TRUCK BOTH DOWN HILL AND DOWN WIND HAD BEEN ISOLATED WITH YELLOW BARRIER TAPE.  THE WIND WAS BLOWING OUT OF THE NORTWEST AT ABOUT 15-20 MPH.  THIS TRUCK WAS PARKED TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE TRUCKERS LOUNGE.  WHILE WE WERE EXAMINING THE SCENE, THE DRIVER WHO HAD BEEN LOCATED IN A HOTEL ROOM, WAS BROUGHT TO OUR LOCATION BY CASINO SECURITY. I ASKED HIM FOR THE MANIFEST AND SHIPPING PAPERS, BUT DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE THERE.  HIS STATEMENT TO US WAS THAT THE CONTAINER WAS LEAKING WATER.  HE SAID THAT IT HAD BEEN IN THEIR YARD FOR A MONTH AND THAT IT WAS FULL OF RAIN WATER.  THE MANIFEST SHOWED THAT THE CONTAINER SHOWED THAT THE CONTAINER HAD BEEN SHIPPED OUT OF MCCLELLAN AFB, CA ON 3-18-97.   I THEN WENT TO THE OFFICE AND SET UP INCIDENT COMMAND.  THE MANIFEST WHICH I RETRIEVED FOR THE DRIVER, SHOWED THE PRODUCT TO BE ""HAZARDOUS WASTE, SOLID, NOS, (1,1,1-TRICHLORETHANE, LEAD) 9, NA3077, FC111 (EPA TOXICITY) ERG#(171)"".  UPON RESEARCHING THE CHEMICAL INVOLVED SHOWS THE CHEMICAL TO BE A INHALATION HAZARD.  I THEN CONTACTED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFORMATION NUMBER (206-872-7859) I REACHED A MR. KELLY PRICE FROM PHILLIP ENVIRONMENTAL, TACOMA, WASHINGTON.  HE STATED THAT PHILLIP ENVIRONMENTAL HAD BE CONTRACTED BY THE AIR FORCE TO DO SOME CLEAN UP OF THE BASE.  THE PRODUCT IN THE CONTAINER SHOWED TO BE PLASTIC SACKS CONTAINING SOLVENT CONTAMINATED PRODUCTS SUCH AS RAGS ETC.  AFTER I EXPLAINED TO MR. PRICE WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE ADVISED THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE CONTRACT WITH TW COMPANY IN SALT LAKE CITY TO CLEAN UP THE SPILLED PRODUCT. AT 0230 HRS THE TRUCKERS LOUNGE WAS CLOSED AND THE ONLY OCCUPANT WAS NOW COMPLAINING OF HEADACHE AND DIFFICULTY BREATHING.  THIS LADY WHO WAS LATER IDENTIFIED AS LINDA SMITH WAS TAKEN TO PEPPERMILL SECURITY OFFICE AND A AMBULANCE WAS DISPATCHED TO THE PEPPERMILL.  I THEN CONTACTED THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DUTY NURSE.  SHE ADVISED THAT SHE HAD BEEN CONTACTED BY THE AMBULANCE SERVICE AND WAS SOMEWHAT AWARE OF THE INCIDENT.

CONTAINER HJCU 721829 ARRIVED LOS ANGELES ON THE DULAT-26 AT 1250 HRS, SAT, 3/1/97.  MGR COOPER DROVE TO THE INTERMODAL FACILITY AND FOUND THE CONTAINER TO BE LEAKING A DARK LIQUID THROUGH THE FLOORING NEAR THE NOSE OF THE CONTAINER.  SEAL (NO PREFIX) 2851-605295 WAS REMOVED TO OPEN THE REAR DOORS AND INSPECT THE LADING.  THE LADING CONSISTED OF 5 GALLON PAILS, STACKED 3 HIGH, WITH A TOTAL OF 36 PAILS TO A PALLET, ALL STRETCH WRAPPED TO EACH OTHER, BUT NOT TO THE PALLET.  THE PALLETS WERE FLOOR LOADED WITH EXCEPTION TO THE CENTER OF THE CONTAINER, WHERE THERE WERE TWO PALLETS STACKED ON TOP OF THE FLOOR LOADED PALLETS.  IT WAS NOTED UPON OPENING THE REAR DOORS THAT THERE WAS NO BLOCKING OR BRACING IN THE CONTAINER TO PROTECT THE LADING FROM MOVING. THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE, NOR IS IT AN APPROVED METHOD FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF HAZ MAT, PER THE BUREAU OF EXPLOSIVES PAMPHLET 6C. ****************** AFTER INITIAL INSPECTION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAKING CONTAINER COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED UNTIL THE LADING WAS REMOVED AND INSPECTED.  AS THE LEAK WAS MINIMAL, A CONTAINER WAS PLACED TO CAPTURE ANY ADDITIONAL DRIPPAGE, AND THE CONTAINER ISOLATED FOR THE EVENING, PENDING INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE SHIPPER.  THE FOLLOWING MORNING, MGR COOPER CONTACTED HANJIN CORP HEADQUARTERS, PARAMUS, NJ, WHO DEFERRED THE HANDLING TO THEIR LONG BEACH OFFICE.   CONTACTED MS CYNTHIA BOYENGER, INTERMODAL SUPV, HANJIN, WHO DEFERRED THE HANDLING TO THEIR CUSTOMER, MASTER FREIGHT LINES.

CONTACTED MR CHUCK FRAIL, KENDALL POLYKEN, AND ADVISED HIM OF THE CONDITION OF THE LADING AND THE REQUIRED REMEDIAL ACTIONS TO CORRECT THE SITUATION.  AS THE LOAD WAS NOT PROPERLY SECURED FOR TRANSPORTATION, MR FRAIL WAS ADVISED THE RAILROAD WOULD NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LEAKING CONTENTS AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE LADING TRANSLOADED.  DURING THIS PROCESS, MGR COOPER MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH HANJIN TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL 40 FOOT CONTAINER IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE TRANSLOADING OPERATION. ***************  ON TUE MORNING, 3/5/97, THE LEAKING CONTAINER, ALONG WITH THE EMPTY PROVIDED BY HANJIN, HJCU 721657, WAS PLACED ON THE GROUND IN ORDER TO WORK THE LADING, AS THERE IS NO LOADING DOCK TO WORK FROM WITHIN THE INTERMODAL FACILITY.

MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE ICTF AND FOUND LESS THAN ONE GALLON OF PRODUCT ON THE GROUND BELOW THE CONTAINER, WHICH WAS DRIPPING SEVERAL DROPS PER MINUTE.  THE CONTAINER WAS DIAPERED AND MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK WHERE IT COULD BE OPENED FOR INSPECTION.  THE STALL WAS SECURED PENDING REMOVAL OF THE PRODUCT FROM THE GROUND.  THE RIGHT DOOR SEAL, BAYER 82595, WAS REMOVED TO INSPECT THE LADING, WHICH COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED AS SHEETS OF PLYWOOD HAD BEEN PLACED ON END AND COMPLETELY COVERED THE CONTENTS. CONTACT WAS MADE WITH THE CSX OFFICE LOCATED AT THE ICTF WHICH PROVIDED THE SHIPPER AND PRODUCT INFORMATION.  AS THERE WAS NO NUMBER LISTED FOR THE BAYER FACILITY IN HOUSTON, CHEMTREC WAS CONTACTED AND REQUESTED TO CONTACT A BAYER REPRESENTATIVE.  MR. ROBERT BLAKE, BAYER CORP., PITTSBURGH, RESPONDED WITH INFORMATION ON A LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE FROM BAYER. MR. DON TAGUE, BAYER, CARSON, CALIFORNIA, MADE CONTACT AND STATED HE WAS ENROUTE TO THE ICTF FACILITY.  ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSLOADING SERVICES, THE RAILROAD'S HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CONTRACTOR, ARRIVED ON SITE AND BEGAN DECONING THE PARKING STALL WHERE THE CONTAINER WAS ORIGINALLY LOCATED.  UPON COMPLETING THE CLEAN UP, THE DOCK AREA WAS STAGED TO BEGIN THE REMOVAL OF THE CONTENTS OF THE CONTAINER.  ONCE MR. TAGUE ARRIVE ON SITE, THE REMOVAL OF THE BLOCKING AND BRACING, WHICH WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AAR BUREAU OF EXPLOSIVES PAMPHLET 6C, BEGAN BY CUTTING THE 2X6 CROSS MEMBERS.  WITH ALL OF THE BLOCKING AND BRACING REMOVED, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE DRUMS AT THE REAR DOORS WERE IN A ROW OF 4 ACROSS, WHICH MEANT THERE WAS A ROW 3 ACROSS SOMEWHERE IN THE CONTAINER, AS THE BILLING SHOWED A TOTAL OF 78 DRUMS BEING SHIPPED. REMOVAL OF THE DRUMS CONTINUED UNTIL LIQUID WAS OBSERVED ON THE LEFT SIDE FLOORING OF THE CONTAINER, 3 ROWS FROM THE NOSE.  UPON REMOVING THE DRUM FROM THE LEFT SIDEWALL OF THE CONTAINER IN THE THIRD ROW, IT WAS NOTED THE BOTTOM CHIME OF THE DRUM HAD METAL FATIGUE FROM RUBBING AGAINST THE SIDEWALL FLOOR CLEAT.  THE CLEAT IS RECESSED INTO THE CORRUGATED SIDEWALL OF THE CONTAINER, AND IN THIS INSTANCE, THE DRUM CHIME WAS AGAINST THE WELD BEAD OF THE CLEAT, WHICH WITH THE VIBRATION DURING TRANSIT, RUBBED THROUGH THE BOTTOM CHIME, ALLOWING PRODUCT TO ESCAPE.  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT LESS THAN 5 GALLONS OF PRODUCT WAS LOST DURING TRANSIT.  THE DAMAGED DRUM WAS PATCHED AND PLACED INTO AN OVERPACK DRUM.  THE REMAINING DRUMS WERE RELOADED INTO CONTAINER SEAU 216764 THAT WAS PROVIDED BY CSX.

COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS CONTACTED BY ARMONDO MARQUEZ, OPERATIONS MANAGER, IN-TERMINAL SERVICES, UNION PACIFIC INTERMODAL FACILITY, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, REPORTING A LEAKING CONTAINER.  THE CONTAINER WAS OBSERVED LEAKING BY THE CRANE OPERATOR WHILE IT WAS BEING REMOVED FROM AN INBOUND TRAIN.  AS THE CONTAINER WAS PLACARDED FLAMMABLE, IT WAS MOVED TO TRAILER STORAGE #6 AND ISOLATE PENDING INSPECTION.  ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSLOADING SERVICES, THE RAILROAD'S HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CONTRACTOR, SENT A TEAM TO INVESTIGATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAKING MATERIAL, WHICH WAS DRIPPING FROM THE RIGHT FRONT CORNER OF THE CONTAINER.  THE ENTIRE CONTENTS OF THE CONTAINER WAS THE NEW STYLE 55 GALLON DRUMS WITH THE ""W"" ROLLING HOOPS, DOUBLE STACKED THROUGHOUT.  TO FACILITATE THE TRANSLOADING OPERATION, THE CONTAINER HAD TO BE GROUNDED, AS THERE IS NO LOADING DOCK TO WORK FROM WITHIN THE INTERMODAL FACILITY,  THIS TOOK SOME TIME TO ACCOMPLISH DUE TO THE DROTT CRANES BEING TIED UP TO FINISH LOADING AN OUTBOUND TRAIN.  DUE TO THE WAY THE DRUMS WERE LOADED IN A DOUBLE STACK CONFIGURATION, THERE WAS NO WAY TO DETERMINE WHICH DRUM(S) WAS THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WITHOUT REMOVING THE ENTIRE CONTENTS. MAERSK WAS CONTACTED AND REQUESTED TO PROVIDE AN EMPTY CONTAINER TO FACILITATE THE TRANSLOAD OPERATION.  DUE TO THE LATENESS OF THE DAY, THEY WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN AN EMPTY CONTAINER FROM HARBOR A DELIVER IT TO THE INTERMODAL FACILITY IN A TIMELY FASHION.  AS THE LEAK HAD CEASED FROM A CONTINUAL DRIP, THE CONTAINER WAS SECURED PENDING RECEIPT OF THE EMPTY.  ON MONDAY MORNING, MAERSK DELIVERY THE EMPTY CONTAINER, MAEU 767172, WHICH WAS PLACED NEXT TO THE ORIGINAL CONTAINER.  THE BLOCKING AND BRACING WHICH APPEARED TO BE IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE AAR BUREAU OF EXPLOSIVES PAMPHLET 6C, WAS REMOVE AND THE DISCHARGE OF THE DRUMS BEGAN.  A DRUM FROM THE FIRST ROW, BOTTOM TIER, AGAINST THE RIGHT SIDE WALL OF THE CONTAINER WAS NOTED TO BE LEAKING PRODUCT FROM THE UPPER ROLLING HOOP.  A DRUM FROM THE SECOND ROW, BOTTOM TIER, ALSO AGAINST THE RIGHT SIDE WALL OF THE CONTAINER WAS NOTED LEAKING PRODUCT FROM THE UPPER ROLLING HOOP.  THE NEXT LEAKER WAS LOCATED IN THE TOP TIER, THREE ROWS FROM THE REAR DOORS, SECOND OUT FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CONTAINER,  WHICH WAS ALSO DAMAGED AND LEAKING PRODUCT FROM THE TOP ROLLING HOOP. SEVERAL DRUMS WERE LOCATED IN THE NOSE OF THE CONTAINER, BOTTOM TIER, WITH THE DRUM IN THE LEFT FRONT CORNER LEAKING AT THE BOTTOM ROLLING HOOP, THE DRUM SECOND FROM THE LEFT CORNER LEAKING AT THE BOTTOM CHIME, AND THE DRUM SECOND FROM THE RIGHT SIDE ALSO LEAKING FROM THE BOTTOM CHIME. ALL OF THE LEAKING DRUMS LOST LESS THAN A GALLON EACH.  NUMEROUS DRUMS HAD ROLLING HOOP DAMAGE (METAL THINNING) SO SEVERE, THAT THEY WERE DEEMED UNFIT FOR FURTHER TRANSPORT.

COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS CONTACTED BY ARMONDO MARQUEZ, OPERATIONS MANAGER, IN-TERMINAL SERVICES, UNION PACIFIC INTERMODAL FACILITY, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, REPORTING A LEAKING CONTAINER.  THE CONTAINER HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BY AN OUTSIDE DRIVER ATTEMPTING TO PICK THE CONTAINER UP FOR DELIVERY.  AS THE CONTAINER WAS PLACARDED BOTH FLAMMABLE AND CORROSIVE, IT WAS MOVED TO TRAILER STORAGE LOT #6 WHERE IT COULD BE ISOLATED PENDING INSPECTION. ENVIRONMENTAL TRANSLOADING SERVICES, THE RAILROAD'S HAZARDOUS MATERIAL CONTRACTOR SENT A TEAM TO INVESTIGATE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAKING MATERIAL.  A CLEAR VISCUS LIQUID WAS DRIPPING FROM THE REAR DOORS.  A FIELD HAZCAT TEST WAS PERFORMED, HOWEVER, THE RESULTS WERE NONDETERMINATIVE.  UPON OPENING THE REAR DOORS, DEVELOPED THE LADING WAS BEING SUPPORTED BY USED PALLETS PLACED ON END AND HELD IN PLACE WITH 2X4'S PLACED IN A ""X"" PATTERN ACROSS THE REAR OF THE CONTAINER.  THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE NOR IS IT AN APPROVED BLOCKING AND BRACING METHOD PER THE BUREAU OF EXPLOSIVES PAMPHLET 6C FOR THE SECUREMENT OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS DURING TRANSIT.  UPON REMOVING THE DUNNAGE, IT WAS NOTED THAT, PALLETS WHICH CONTAINED 100 POUND BAGS OF A SOLID SUBSTANCE, HAD BEEN PLACED DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE FLOOR LOADED 55 GALLON DRUMS WITH NO BI-LEVEL SEPARATION.  THIS IS ALSO NOT AN APPROVED METHOD FOR DOUBLE STACKING FREIGHT WITH HAZARDOUS COMMODITIES.  UPON THE REMOVAL OF THE PALLETIZED BAGS, THE FIRST ROW OF DRUMS WAS REMOVED AND THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS LOCATED.  A DRUM OF GLYCOL ETHER DB WAS LOCATED IN THE SECOND ROW, SECOND FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CONTAINER.  THE LOWER ROLLING HOOP HAD SUSTAINED DAMAGE WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT IT WAS DAMAGED PRIOR TO BEING LOADED, AS THERE WAS NO ADJACENT FREIGHT WHICH WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE TO THE DRUM.  THERE WAS A CREASE WHICH TRAVELED VERTICAL ON THE SIDEWALL OF THE DRUM THAT STARTED NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE DRUM, THROUGH THE ROLLING HOOP, ENDING NEAR THE BOTTOM CHIME OF THE DRUM. THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE IS TYPICALLY CAUSED BY ADJACENT PALLETS.  IN THAT THIS DRUMS WAS SURROUNDED BY DRUMS, IT WAS DEEMED TO BE PRIOR DAMAGE.  ROUGHLY 30 GALLONS OF THE PRODUCT ESCAPED THROUGH THE ROLLING HOOP.  AS THIS COMMODITY WAS NOT A REGULATED PRODUCT, IT WAS PATCHED AND PLACED INTO A RECOVERY DRUM FOR MOVEMENT ON WITH THE REMAINING FREIGHT, PER THE SHIPPERS INSTRUCTIONS.  FURTHER INTO THE LADING, 12 ADDITIONAL DRUMS LABELED AS GLYCOL ETHER EB WERE LOCATED, ONE OF WHICH WAS WEEPING PRODUCT FROM THE UPPER CHIME.  THIS DRUM HAD A VERTICAL DENT IN THE SIDEWALL JUST BELOW THE TOP CHIME, WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE ADJACENT DRUMS.  THIS ALSO APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN DAMAGED PRIOR TO LOADING AT THE POINT OF ORIGIN.  IT APPEARS TO HAVE WEEPED SOME OF THE PRODUCT DURING TRANSIT, AND IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE LOST LESS THAN ONE GALLON OF PRODUCT.
