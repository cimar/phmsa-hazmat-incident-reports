After securing the rear of the load the driver took a 10 hour break. At approximately 0445 the driver conducted his pre-trip inspection and tire check and began his trip. At approximately 0630 the driver stopped at the TA Truck Stop in London, Ohio to have a suspension adjustment made. As the driver was preparing to enter the shop he noticed liquid leaking from the trailer near the landing gear. The driver immediately moved the vehicle to a safe location, placed a bucket under the trailer to contain the leak and notified his manager who advised him to notify the truck stop, local police and fire departments. Upon arrival the local police and fire departments checked the manifests and established a 300 foot perimeter around the vehicle. Approximately one hour later personnel from the Ohio Highway patrol Haz Mat unit entered the trailer to establish which drum was leaking. They identified a drum near the front of the trailer as having a pin hole in the side. Upon the notification from the Haz Mat team the driver secured the trailer and waited for the Clean Harbors Emergency response Team to arrive.  At 0700 on 11/13/15, a Clean Harbors Emergency Response Team was dispatched from Cincinnati, Ohio to remediate the spill. The team reviewed the load information with Clean Harbors Environmental Health and Safety to establish the proper equipment necessary for this response and was enroute at 0845. The Emergency response team arrived at 1015 and met with the driver and Ohio Highway Patrol Haz Mat team to determine the location of the leaking drum and checked the drum against the manifest. At 1145, after setting up Air and Confined Space Entry equipment the response team donned appropriate Personal Protective equipment and entered the trailer and plugged the leaking drum. At 1230 they laid down clay absorbent and packed it around the drum at the direction of the Ohio Highway Patrol Haz Mat Team leader. At 1345 the Emergency Response Team re-secured the trailer and load, cleaned up the absorbents from the ground and wiped down the frame rails and underside of the trailer. At 1430 they demobed from the site and followed the driver back to Spring Grove, Ohio at the direction of the State Haz Mat Patrolmen. At 1630 the driver and response team arrived at Spring Grove, Ohio where the trailer was placed in containment and turned over to plant personnel.",A review of load securement requirements and techniques will be conducted with drivers and shipping personnel.

While having driven a short distance he noticed what appeared to be a cloud coming from the vehicle.  He pulled off the road and noticed liquid coming from under the door.  A response crew was summoned, donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and entered the truck.  The bottom valve of a 275 gallon tote was broken causing the liquid to leak on to the truck floor and onto the gravel surface of the road shoulder.  TX DOT and TCEQ were notified and incident #20154196 was created.  TXDOT and the response crew are working out the details of the road shoulder remediation.",The driver had installed the valve closure that is used by the generator.  This is not the standard closure but one that has a camlock.  This causes the closure to slightly protrude past the outside of the IBC.  The dog ear was found broken on the floor of the truck along with the zip tie.  The leaking tote was loaded with the valve to the right against another tote.  Had the unit been loaded with a board or something to insure against the protruding valve coming in contact with the other tote this may not have leaked.

Driver was transporting Hazardous Waste solid NOS (Lead) from NYCDDC Brooklyn, NY to Clean Earth, Kearny NJ.  He was transporting approx. 22 tons of cargo being shipped on a Hazardous Waste Manifest.  The accident occurred as driver was exiting 95N and entering 15W near the toll plaza.      Mr. Heyer reported he was traveling at approx. 35MPH when he started to sneeze.  He believes he jerked the wheel during the sneezing episode and only recalls becoming alert when the truck came to rest on the passenger side.  Two Horwith drivers were traveling behind the unit at the time of the accident. Louis Vasquez was traveling directly behind unit 245 and driver Christian Smith was following Vasquez.  Both drivers stopped and assisted with the accident.  911 was immediately notified.  Christian Smith assisted to control the scene while Louis Vasquez assisted extracting driver, Joseph Heyer from the overturned unit.  The fuel tank was not ruptured and no other fluid was released.  Approximately 10 ton of the contaminated cargo was released onto the roadway.      Upon hearing of the accident Horwith Implemented our Contingency plan.  Clean Earth was immediately notified of the situation.  NJDEP was also notified (report #151116152120) along with the US National Response Center (report #1133563).  NJ State Police arrived and took command of the scene. Horwith was instructed not to send an Emergency Response Cleanup Team as the state police would handle.  The NJTA responded and initiated all cleanup efforts.  Horwith was asked to have another unit brought to the scene so the product could be remediated and shipped for disposal.
