THE PILOT TRAVEL CENTER IS OWNED BY PILOT TRAVEL CENTERS, LLC (PILOT).  UPON ARRIVAL, THE SOCI DRIVER GAUGED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A DIESEL UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK (UST) LOCATED SOUTHWEST OF THE DIESEL PUMP ISLANDS.  IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THIS TANK WAS AN OIL/WATER SEPARATOR.  THE SOCI DRIVER SUBSEQUENTLY PUMPED 7,503 GALLONS OF LOW SULFUR DIESEL FUEL FROM HIS TRUCK TO THE OIL/WATER SEPARATOR.   AFTER COMPLETING THE DELIVERY, THE SOCI DRIVER PRESENTED DOCUMENTATION OF DELIVERY TO THE STORE PERSONNEL, AND LEFT THE SITE.  THE DELIVERY DOCUMENTATION INDICATED THAT A STICK READING OF THE TANK WAS 0 INCHES PRIOR TO THE DELIVERY, AND THAT AFTER THE DELIVERY THE STICK READING WAS 62 INCHES.  I ADDITION, THE DOCUMENTATION SHOWED THAT 3,003 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL WAS PUMPED INTO COMPARTMENT #1, 1,500 GALLONS IN COMPARTMENT #3 AND 3,000 GALLONS INTO COMPARTMENT #4, WHICH WERE ACTUALLY CHAMBERS IN THE OIL/WATER SEPARATOR.  A DESCRIPTION OF THE RELEASE IS SUMMARIZED IN TABLE 1-1 BELOW.  THE LOCATION OF THE AREA ON A USGS TOPOGRAPHIC MAP IS PROVIDED AS FIGURE A-1.  A SITE MAP US PROVIDED AS FIGURE A-2.  THE DIESEL FUEL SUBSEQUENTLY FLOWED FROM THE SEPARATOR TO A RETENTION POND LOCATED SOUTHWEST OF THE SEPARATOR (FIGURE 2).  THE DIESEL FUEL FLOWED ACROSS THE POND AND ENTERED A SEVEN-INCH DIAMETER DRAIN AT THE BASE OF A PRECAST CONCRETE CATCH BASIN LOCATED AT THE SOUTHERN TERMINUS OF THE RETENTION POND.  THE DIESEL FUEL WAS CONVEYED FOR THE CATCH BASIN TO FRENCH CREEK VIA A CORRUGATED PLASTIC DRAIN PIPE.  DIESEL FUEL WAS THE CONVEYED DOWNSTREAM FROM ON FRENCH CREEK AND  INTO BLACK RIVER.  AN ESTIMATED TOTAL OF 1,600 GALLONS OF DIESEL FUEL WERE RELEASED TO ENVIRONMENT.  APPROXIMATELY TWO HOURS LATER, PILOT CALLED SOCI TO REPORT THAT THEY WERE RUNNING OUT OF DIESEL FUEL IN THE USTS.  SOCI CALLED PILOT AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00 AM, AND WAS INFORMED BY A PILOT EMPLOYEE THAT THE SOCI DRIVER HAD PUMPED THE DIESEL FUEL INTO A STRUCTURE THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE DIESEL UST SYSTEM. ACCORDING TO SOCI, THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM PILOT THOUGHT THE STRUCTURE WAS AN INACTIVE (I.E., ""DEAD"") UST.  SOCI ASKED IF SOMEONE FROM PILOT SHOULD BE CONTACTED, AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PILOT STORE MANAGER WOULD ARRIVE AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00 AM, AND HE WOULD CALL SOCI IF NECESSARY.    AT A LATER TIME, THE PILOT STORE MANAGER CALLED SOCI TO REPORT THAT THE DIESEL FUEL HAD BEEN PUMPED INTO AN OIL/WATER SEPARATOR WHICH HAD DISCHARGED TO AN ON-SITE RETENTION POND, BUT THE POND WOULD PREVENT THE PRODUCT FROM LEAVING THE SITE.  AFTER SPEAKING TO THE PILOT STORE MANAGER, SOCI DISPATCHED PERSONNEL AND A VACUUM TRUCK TO THE SITE.

I BELIEVE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT GOT THE CALL AT 1:33 P.M. THE TRUCK WAS HEADED WEST ON HWY. 70 GOING DOWN A SLIGHT GRADE TOWARDS THE 70/89 JUNCTION. CHP OFFICER JIM WHEATON SAID THAT HE TALKED TO BRIAN AT THE PORTOLA EMERGENCY ROOM ABOUT THE ACCIDENT THAT AFTERNOON. BRIAN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD DRIFTED ONTO THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND CAUGHT SOME SNOW ON THE EDGE THAT STARTED TO GRAB THE TRUCK, BRIAN SAID HE SWUNG THE TRUCK TO THE LEFT AND MUST HAVE OVER CORRECTED TO THE LEFT. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN WHEN THE TRUCK STARTED TO SKID SIDEWAYS AND THEN FLIPPED ONTO ITS RIGHT SIDE WHILE SKIDDING TOWARDS THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE OFFICER ASKED IF BRIAN HAD BLACKED OUT OR DOZED OFF, BRIAN SAID NO HE HAD NOT BLACKED OUT OR DOZED OFF BUT THAT PERHAPS HE HAD REACHED OVER FOR HIS COFFEE. ROAD CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN WET ROADWAY WITH NO APPARENT ICE. BY THE SKID MARKS ON THE TRAILER SIDES IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRAILER WENT OVER INITIALLY ON IT'S RIGHT SIDE, THEN CONTINUED TO SLIDE WHILE IT ROTATED ONTO IT'S TOP AND THEN ON IT'S LEFT SIDE AS IT SLID OFF THE LEFT THE ROADWAY SHOULDER. THE ENTIRE TRACTOR AND SEMI TRAILER ALSO ROTATED COUNTER CLOCKWISE 180 DEGREES SO THAT AS THE UNIT LEFT THE ROADWAY IT WAS THE TAIL END OF THE TRAILER THAT WENT FIRST OVER THE BANK AND THE TRACTOR THAT WAS STILL HOOKED JUST HAD TO FOLLOW IT OVER THE BANK. IT CAME TO REST IN THE SNOW AND MUD ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WITH THE TRACTOR AND THE TRAILER IN A STRAIGHT LINE WITH THE TRACTOR POINTING UPHILL TOWARDS THE ROADWAY. I RECEIVED THE CALL ABOUT THE ACCIDENT FROM JIM REICHLE AT 2:05 P.M. PACIFIC TIME AND WHICH POINT I CALLED THE GRAEAGLE FIRE DEPARTMENT DISPATCH AND TALKED WITH THEM TO FIND OUT MORE DETAILS. HE LISTED A TRUCK NUMBER THAT FIRMLY PINNED IT DOWN THAT IT WAS OUR TRACTOR #111 AND I KNEW IT WOULD HAVE TRAILER #468 BEHIND IT AND THAT BRIAN BURNS WOULD BE THE DRIVER INVOLVED. THE DISPATCHER EXPLAINED THAT THE DRIVER WAS CONSCIOUS AND ALERT BUT STILL IN THE CAB OF THE TRUCK AND THAT THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING SET UP TO CUT THE CAB SO THAT THEY COULD GET THE DRIVER OUT. WHEN THE EMERGENCY CREWS GOT BRIAN OUT OF THE TRUCK CAB THEY TRANSPORTED HIM TO THE PORTOLA EMERGENCY CLINIC AND THEN HE WAS LATER TRANSPORTED TO WASHOE MEDICAL CENTER IN RENO NV. BETWEEN SEVERAL CALLS TO OUR LOCAL DRIVERS AND ALSO TO JIM REICHLE I PLANNED ON USING SCOTT CARLSON WHO WAS STILL 4 1/2 HOURS AWAY AND MITCH HOAGLAND WHO WAS SOMEWHERE WITHIN 1-2 HOURS AWAY. THESE DRIVERS WOULD BE UTILIZED TO PUMP OFF THE LOADED TRAILER BEFORE WE TRIED TO PULL IT UP TO THE ROADWAY. I ASKED HARVEY HICKS TO HELP COLLECT HOSES AND FITTINGS AND TO ALSO HELP AT THE ACCIDENT SCENE WITH SET UP AND RETRIEVAL OF THE EQUIPMENT. WE LOADED INTO HARVEY PICK UP TRUCK MANY LENGTHS OF VAPOR AND LIQUID HOSE AND NUMEROUS FITTINGS AND PIPE WRENCHES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO HOOK THE HOSES TOG",,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,75000,,US,

HUNEWILL CONSTRUCTION WAS TRANSPORTING DEEP POST ORE FROM CARLIN, NEVADA TO THE TWIN CREEKS MINE.  THE TRUCKS HAULING THIS ORE ARE PLACARDED FOR ARSENIC AS SOME OF THE LOADS CONTAIN REPORTABLE QUANTITIES OF THIS MATERIAL.  THE TRUCK MR. MILLER WAS DRIVING IS A BELLY DUMP TRAIN SET UP IN A ROCKY MOUNTAIN DOUBLE CONFIGURATION.  THIS PARTICULAR CONFIGURATION CONSISTS OF A 4 AXLE TRUCK TRACTOR WITH A 3 AXLE SEMI BELLY DUMP TRAILER FOLLOWED BY A SMALLER 2 AXLE BELLY DUMP TRAILER OR PUP AS IT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO.  ABOUT 4:00 PM MR. MILLER HAD JUST ARRIVED AT THE MAIN GATE OF THE TWIN CREEKS MINE WHERE HIS TRUCK WAS WEIGHED IN ON THE MINE SCALES AND THE SAFETY CHAINS WERE REMOVED FROM THE DUMP GATES.  FOR SAFETY REASONS THE DRIVERS WERE DISCOURAGED FROM GETTING OUT OF THEIR TRUCKS AT THE DUMP AREA.  IT FOR THIS REASON THAT THE SAFETY CHAINS WERE REMOVED FROM THE DUMP GATES AT THE SCALES.  MR. MILLER THEN PROCEEDED UP THE MINE ROAD APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILES WHEN THE DUMP GATES ON THE PUP TRAILER OPENED SPILLING THE ORE ONTO THE ROAD.  BECAUSE OF THE ROUGHNESS OF THE ROAD MR. MILLER DID NOT REALIZE THE MATERIAL HAD BEEN DUMPED UNTIL HE REACHED THE ORE STOCKPILE AREA.  BY THIS TIME NEWMONT PERSONNEL HAD DISCOVERED THE MATERIAL AND BROUGHT A FRONT END LOADER AND MOTOR GRADER IN TO CLEAN UP THE ORE AND TRANSPORT IT TO THE ORE STOCKPILE. LOREN HUNEWILL WAS INFORMED OF THE SPILL BY NEWMONT PERSONNEL AND ASKED TO FILE A PHONE REPORT ON THE INCIDENT, WHICH HE DID.  AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE DUMP GATE WIRING OF THE TRUCK AND THE SAFETY CHAINS ARE NOW REMOVED IN A SAFE AREA MUCH CLOSER TO THE ORE STOCKPILE.",,Yes,HOPPER,Highway hopper trailer for solid materials only,HOPPER T,Yes,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,200,,US,
