The Maryland Department of Environment was notified by Clean Harbors plant compliance officer.",Clean Harbors conducted an internal review of the incident and concluded that moisture was likly present in the drum due to rain that day during the Household Hazardous waste collection. A Clean Harbors review team evaluated several options to minimize the handling of oxidizers during waste collections and decided that oxidizers will be packed in sealable water resistant containers until they can be sorted and packaged properly to avoid the possibility of getting the product wet.

She had gloves on during the whole load/unload process and basically took the bag which was about one-fourth full and placed it on the belt loader.  She did not immediately notify any supervision of the substance until four hours later to Ryan Buckner who later got with the Airport police who later had the substance reviewed. A call was received from Moreau at 0241am advising that the results from the Fire Department regarding the substance found it to be of hazardous material that is mostly used for batteries and if wet would be dangerous.,"Ms. Turner failed to follow proper procedures on reporting what seemed to be a suspicious item to Leadership immediately, therefore, her actions in regard to this will be handled accordingly by Emmett Winters immediately.   I will be revisiting the proper procedure to all personnel with a signoff to ensure that everybody is aware on the proper process when an unidentified item is located on or near an aircraft.",No,BAG PLASTIC,Plastic bag (cont1 for solid materials),BAG PLS,No,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Mesa Airlines, Inc",US,

As it entered a slight right curve the unit left the roadway going off the berm into the median. The driver attempted to steer the unit to the right slightly re-entering the roadway causing the unit to rollover. The unit was severely damaged and was leaking product. The driver was wearing his seat belt. He exited the unit and 911 was called. The EMA, Local VFD's, PASP, NRC, DEP, PEMA, and wrecker service were all notified. Product was leaking from the dome lid area as it was crushed from the rollover. The product leakage was contained by dirt being placed in the direction of flow. Two wreckers were then used to upright the unit which stopped the leakage.  The duration of leakage was approximately three hours. 833 gallons per hour or 13.89 gallons per minute. The product was left in place to cool and solidify for 24 hours as it posed no environmental threat. It was then removed with limited amount of soil. The area was cleared of debris and restored to it's natural state. All first responders and emergency crews are to be commended for their actions through the duration of this incident.","Our company utilizes several forms of online and hands on training materials provided by PERS, J.J. Keller & Associates, Acuity Insurance Co., and various other sources. Our main priority is safety and compliance, which is a never ending daily process. The safety of our drivers is most important as is the safety of the general public who travel the same hi ways as we do. As every company knows, you only have control over your drivers while they are on duty as your employee. It is difficult to regulate their off duty hours. You provide the necessary training to help them realize the importance of their personal time and hope they use it in a beneficial manner. The unit that was damaged, resulting in leakage of product, did remain structurally sound. An emergency shut off valve on the vent system was manually closed to prevent further leakage from that point. The rollover protection box was crushed. This caused a deformity to the dome lid area where the leakage occurred. Immediate action and response is very important in minimizing leakage through containment and shutting off the source.",Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,155933,"Erie Enterprises, Inc.",US,

BNSF and contract responders inspecting GATX 34188 reported finding both liquid valves' and the vapor valve's closure plugs loose (only hand tight). Icing was observed accumulating around the B-end liquid valve's closure plug area with the valve in the closed position, therefore some residue commodity vapors were by-passing this closed valve. This liquid valve's closure plug was removed and new Teflon tape applied to its threaded area, reinserted and properly tool tightened. The other closure plugs were also properly tool tightened. Afterwards, no further vapor venting was evident when leak tests were completed. The icing at the valve housing area evaporated. Response was concluded by 0845 hrs.

Vehicle went off the right shoulder then corrected back onto the highway causing the pup trailer to over correct and with product slosh tripped on the pavement and skidded down the shoulder of the roadway. The damage from hitting the pavement and the abrasive effect of the highway the skin was breached and allowed diesel to escape from the tank. The driver was able to keep the tractor and lead trailer upright and safely stop off the roadway.   The driver called 911 and reported the incident; then called Dixon Bros. Inc. dispatch office to report the accident. Driver observed some leakage and was instructed to use spill kit to protect any drainage area. EMS responded as well as I responded to the sight. Diesel was flowing out of the ruptured tank at a fairly rapid rate. A storm water drain (cross over culvert) was about 150’ from the spill point so dirt was put in the pipe to plug it preventing any diesel to enter and contaminate the other side of the roadway. A trench was dug to capture diesel and allow a vacuum truck to remove it as it collected in the trench. Approximately 17 barrels or 714 gallons were recovered by the vac truck. Spill duration was close to 2 hours.   The trailer that was overturned was evacuated by another Dixon Bros. truck that was dispatched to assist with the accident. Approximately 2169 gallons were recovered at the crash site from the overturned trailer that was delivered to the end user.   Remediation efforts started the following day with contaminated soil being dug up and stockpiled for transit. All materials were transported to Northeast Wyoming Soil and fresh fill and top soil was hauled in for remediation. Seeding has taken place and we are waiting for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality to send the necessary forms to close the incident.",Truck drivers are being trained in quarterly safety meetings to use defensive driving techniques to keep from leaving the roadway when encountering obstacles in their lane. Response time and duties have been discussed to shorten duration of time from accident till company response vehicles are dispatched to the scene.

Road conditions were very slick and muddy due to recent heavy rain in the area.  While on the muddy road, the driver traveled slowly up a slight grade when the tires broke traction and begun to slide.  The driver stopped the unit completely and in doing so, the trailer slid toward the ditch.  The driver set the brakes on the truck, but the trailer continued to slide into a steep ditch until the fifth-wheel broke free and the trailer overturned.  The driver was not injured as a result of the trailer over-turning.  There was also no evidence that the cargo tank had been compromised.  The driver then reported the incident.    Company personnel responded to the scene and notifications were made to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and Oklahoma Corporation Commission.  Recover services arrived on scene early the following morning and uprighted the trailer.  It was at that time, oil was discovered missing from the cargo tank.  After investigating, it was discovered that approximately 119 bbl of crude oil had released into very porous soil under the trailer with no visible free liquid on the surface. The release occurred over a duration of approximately 12 hours.  Futher investigation revealed the valve had not been damaged, but the valve handle had been forced open due to roll-over impact in the mud.  After the trailer was removed from the site, a State Registered Environmental Contractor excavated and removed the contaminated soil from the scene and disposed of it properly in the Davis Sanitary landfill near Tonkawa, OK.",Company shall provide additional awareness training to drivers regarding Recognition of High Risk/Consequence Potential and Exercising Good Judgment when dealing with hazardous road conditions or other environmental factors.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,182500,"BKEP Crude, LLC",US,

The drivers unit left the roadway and traveled through a culvert and a large ditch in a field.  In the process of travelling through the ditch in the field the trailer came loose from the truck overturning in the field. The trailer shell was punctured slightly from the landing gear, resulting in 500 gallons of gasoline to leak out of the trailer into the field.

Probable strap failure due to either poor rigging techniques or strap mechnically failed.   2.  Due to the aforementioned strap failure the use of the 200 foot long line caused the pallet to be tipped in such a way as to spill the content of the pallet during transit up the mountain.,"1.  Purchase bulk container for battery lifts.  2.  Perform Rigging class  3.  Reduce the use of pallets for lifting whenever possible.  4.  Perform lifts with a shorter line and place further from structures.  5.  Use bag and net for battery lifts until bulk container is purchased.  6.  Perform inspection daily of lifting equipment to be used  7.  Pilots to do more work as ground crew to improve familiarity with rigging.    *These recommendations are the result of findings made by a Safety Analysis Team on 23 October 2013, that was convened at 1300hrs and attended by Ray NewComb, Douglas MacIver, Carl Svenson, Walter Archer, Alex Fouillit, Chris Thresher, and Warren Rooks.

The crew was aware of the possibility that the Minncare Sterilant, over time, could cause the inner containers to become brittle.  Due to this knowledge they thought it would be best to place the containers in some sort of plastic bag or liner and they placed each container into large zip-lock bags.  It appears the bags were just a bit on the small side to get a good seal with the containers inside.  During transportation the labpack piece shifted in the motor vehicle, causing the container to tip over.  It is thought that during the handling and most likely the tipping of the box, that one container cracked and the zip-lock bag did not serve its intended purpose, allowing liquid to leak out of the inner container, ziplock bag, and the outer package. Once discovered, the Minncare leaking from the container was cleaned up, repackaged, and sent for appropriate disposal.","1. The Minncare Sterilant and other solutions like this, are prone to causing integrity issues of their containers. This will be discussed in a weekly training with the group and reviewed by the safety committee.    2. The load shift or rough handling that most likely caused the cracking of the inner container is not acceptable and will be reviewed with all employees.    3. Although a good attempt, the failure to seal the container in a “liner” resulted in an inability to contain any possible spill. In the future, we will use larger ziplock or other type bags to assure the inner container doesn't leak and/or evaluate if the inner container can be changed to a newer inner container.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Fiber drum,1G,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"Veolia ES Technical Solutions, LLC",US,

THE TRUCK WAS A TRACTOR PULLING A SEMI TRAILER BEHIND THE SEMI TRAILER.  DRIVER WAS HAULING 10,000 GALLONS OF BLENDSTOCK DIESEL FORM EVANSTON, WY TO WOODS CROSS, UT.  THE LEAD TRAILER WAS LOADED WITH 6400 GALLONS AND THE PUP TRAILER WAS LOADED WITH 3600 GALLONS.  THE TRUCK WAS TRAVELING IN THE LEFT LANE ON THE FREEWAY OVERTAKING A SLOWER TRUCK THAT WAS TRAVELING IN THE RIGHT LANE.  THE TRUCK STARTED INTO A RIGHT HAND CURVE, POSTED 50 MPH, AT APPROXIMATELY 65 MPH.  APPARENTLY THE DRIVER REALIZED HE WAS TRAVELING TO FAST FOR THE CURVE AND GOT ON HIS BRAKES HARD, CAUSING THE PUP TO TIP ITS SIDE INTO THE CENTER BARRIER AND ROADWAY.  THE OVERTURN OF THE PUP RUPTURED THE BARREL AND THE DIESEL IMMEDIATELY STARTED SPILLING OUT ONTO THE ROAD.  THE DRIVER CONTINUED DRIVING ABOUT 1/8 OF A MILE FURTHER BEFORE PULLING ONTO THE RIGHT HAND SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  THE DIESEL SPILLING OUT OF THE TRAILER STARTED BURNING IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE IMPACT AND BARREL RUPTURE.  THERE WAS STILL DIESEL IN THE PUP TRAILER AFTER THE TRUCK CAME TO A REST ON THE RIGHT SHOULDER.  THE REMAINING DIESEL THAT WAS BURNING IN THE PUP TRAILER CAUGHT THE SEMI TRAILER.  SVT WAS NOTIFIED BY DRIVER AT APPROXIMATELY 08:30 A.M. OF THE INCIDENT AND IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED CHEMTREC.  SVT ALSO CALLED THE UHP AND WAS PUT IN TOUCH WITH THE OFFICER IN CHARGE, L. REMUND, AND NOTIFIED HIM OF THE CARGO AND GALLONS ON THE LOAD.  SVT WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE BOL FROM THE SHIPPER AND WAS ABLE TO FORWARD THAT INFORMATION IN AN E-MAIL ONTO OFFICER REMUND.  ENVORO CARE WAS ALSO NOTIFIED AND DISPATCHED TO OVERSEE THE CLEAN-UP.  DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE TRUCK AND THE FACT IT WAS BURNING, UHP COULD NOT GET A VISUAL ON THE TRAILER PLACARDS.  NOT KNOWING WHAT TYPE OF FUEL THE TRUCK WAS CARRYING, THEY DID NOT ATTEMPT TO FIGHT THE FIRE OR ENTER THE TRUCK CAB TO OBTAIN THE ORIGINAL BOL.  AFTER CONFIRMING THE CARGO AND HAZARDS INVOLVED WITH EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE, THE UTAH HIGHWAY PATROL AND MORGAN CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT DECIDED TO LET THE FIRE BURN IT SELF OUT.  THE FREEWAY IN THAT AREA HAS A CONCRETE SURFACE AND CONCRETE CENTER BARRIERS.  THE UTAH STATE ROAD DEPARTMENT SPREAD SAND ALONG THE CENTER DIVIDED AND ALONG THE WEST BOUND LANES OF THE FREEWAY TO SOAK UP ANY REMAINING FUEL.  A MACHINE WAS CALLED IN TO ROTORMILL SOME CONCRETE OFF A BRIDGE DECK THAT FUEL HAD COVERED.  UDOT KEPT THE FREEWAY CLOSED WHILE THEY CHISELED OUT EXPANSION JOINTS IN THE FREEWAY THAT WHERE COMPROMISED IN THE FIRE AND REPAIRED THEM.  ENVIRO CARE PUMPED THE PRODUCT OFF THE LEAD TRAILER AND CLEANED UP THE FREEWAY OF ALL REMAINING PRODUCT AS WELL AS HAULED OFF THE SATURATED SAND THAT WAS PUT ON ROAD SURFACE.  AMS TOWING HAULED THE TRACTOR AND BOTH TRAILERS TO THEIR YARD IN OGDEN AND CLEANED UP ALL THE DEBRIS FROM THE THREE UNITS.","SEVIER VALLEY TRANSPORTATION LLC WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE DECISION TO LET THE DIESEL FUEL BURN OFF.  HAD SVT BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE INVOLVED, WE WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED THE FIRE TO BE EXTINGUISHED AND CONCENTRATE ON THE CONTAINMENT OF THE REMAINING DIESEL. IT IS SVT BELIEF THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE ROAD DAMAGED WAS CAUSED BY THE UNNECESSARY LENGTH OF TIME THE FIRE WAS ALLOWED TO BURN. SVT BELIEVES THE FIRE COULD HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH AS SOON AS UHP KNEW WHAT PRODUCT WAS ON THE VEHICLE. HAD THE FREEWAY NOT SUSTAINED AS MUCH FIRE RELATED DAMAGE AS IT DID, MAYBE THE LENGTH OF CLOSURE COULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED. SVT BELIEVES THAT THE SEMI TRAILER HELD UP EXTREMELY WELL UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. NO DIESEL WAS RELEASED FROM THE SEMI TRAILER EVEN THOUGH IT WAS EXPOSED TO AN ENORMOUS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO REDUCE THE LOSS OF DIESEL. SVT BELIEVES THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY ""DRIVER ERROR"". ALTHOUGH WE SCREEN DRIVERS BEFORE HIRING AND HAVE REGULAR SAFETY ORIENTED DISCUSSIONS AS WELL AS MEETINGS, SVT COULD NOT HAVE FORESEEN THIS ACCIDENT.
