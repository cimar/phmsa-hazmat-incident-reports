When it arrived here in MIA our FSC inspected the condition of the ULD ""Unit Load Device"" and it was found to be unserviceable. This placed us in a position in which we had to change the ULD in order to expedite the shipment. So we had to rebuilt this ULD. When we were in the process of rebuilding this shipment of Seafood,  we found two (2) boxes containing six (6) aerosol cans with a net weight of 12 oz. (340g) of the product “Bakers Joy” Baking Spray with flour ( http://www.bakersjoy.com/ ) hidden between the Styrofoam Seafood Boxes. These boxes inside this CLC’s also contained the CCSF Cargo Stamp. This was a clear trigger for a Hidden DG and possibly a Hidden DG scenario for a Class 3 Aerosol Flammable. No MSDS found for this product.  Inccident was reported to the FAA and we were instructed to fill 5800. Inccident still under investigation.",We are now questioning the Shipper who loaded and tendered this shipment into our ULD. This shipper has a CCSF security Screening Certificate for the TSA and is obligated to report to us the actual content of the cargo. Incident is currently under investigation.

Facility is evacuated. 9-1-1 notified.  Safety Manager notified.  Multiple fire departments (F/D) respond including Fremont and Angola. F/D point of contact - Fire Chief Eric Hufnagle.  F/D sprays down drums as necessary to keep cool until Terra returns to site. Approximately 1630, Chief Hufnagle closes North Old 27 as a precautionary measure following ERG recommendations and the amount of hazardous materials in close proximity to reactive drum(s) including propane tanks.  Two outlet malls within the recommended isolation distance and a hotel were evacuated.  One dockworker close to the explosion, decontaminated (washed down with water) and transported to hospital as a precautionary measure.  Material continues to react until neutralized.

The lading was transferred from PLCX 224373 to intermodal tanks and delivered to destination. This tank car has been cleaned + purged of all hazmat residue. The shipper has been placed on notice that this car cannot proceed to home shop on its own wheels.     *Two KCS employees indicated they detected odor of material, claimed exposure, and elected to be examined at North Kansas City Hospital.  Employee #1 reported trouble breathing, light headedness, and burning eyes.  Employee #2 was taken to the same hospital for minor throat irritation.  Both employees were thouroughly examined and released back into work as of Monday April 8, 2013 at 1300 hrs.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released. It has been reported by the shipper/consignee that 1,336 gallons total had been released, of that, 40 gallons had been released in the KCS Kansas City Knoche Yard. The remainder was released from points in between offeror and points of incident.    File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","Recommendations:  The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions.

Contract responders inspected ETCX 21144 observing several drips per minute from the bottom outlet. Responders reported finding the primary bottom outlet valve's operating handle in a partial open position and not pinned. The auxiliary bottom outlet valve was also in an open position with its closure plug not tool tight. Responders closed both valves and tool tightened the loose closure plug which ended any further commodity drips. New seals numbered 85883 and 85884 were applied at the pinned valve handles. Responders applied soda ash to neutralize ground spillage observed under ETCX 21144. Response was concluded by 1830 hrs. CDT, 4/05/2013.

Contract responders placed a catch receptacle under NATX 300757 and inspected the closed BOV. The commodity drip source was at the BOV mounting flange area. Responders attempted to stop the drips by tightening the BOV mounting flange bolts which did not stop the dripping. Responders then applied putty material around the flange connection to seal off the drips. The BOV mounting flange gasket was suspected as the leak cause. Spillage evaporated as no ground staining or commodity smell was noted.  NATX 300757 was carefully moved to the facility's containment area/pit for product transfer. On 4/06/2013, all commodity within NATX 300757 was transferred to another suitable tank car without further incident. The drip pit was cleaned of all liquids which consisted primarily of rainwater from a previous rain event.

The propane was then pumped into another truck.,"The company has a rollover prevention policy titled, ""SLIP OFF STAY OFF"" with cab posters and training reminders.  The idea is to bring the vehicle under control without attempting to radically change the path which can cause liquid load shifting and add to the potential for overturn.  After each such accident a committee reviews the investigative facts to determine whether the driver followed company safety practices and whether disciplinary actions are appropriate.

An NS environmental contractor was called and metered the car for H2S.  Readings were zero at the fittings on top but they got reading from 40 to 330ppm from the bottom of the car, around the bottom outlet area.  Bottom outlet cap was ""snooped"" and found to be not properly secured.  Cap was removed, gasket examined (found to be OK) and the cap reapplied.  No further leaks were found with ""snoop"" but odor persisted.  H2S readings from 40 - 330ppm were detected coming from the annular space between the jacket and the tank.  Shipper's contractor checked the car and determined that the odor was from product spilled between the jacket and the tank and there were no further leaks.

It appears that in his attempt to gain control of his vehicle and trailer, he overcorrected, sending his truck across the highway into oncoming traffic.  In doing so, his trailer looks to have jack-knifed around to the right colliding with an oncoming Ford F-250 truck and trailer.  The driver of the Ford truck was killed on impact.  Robert’s truck continued across that lane and off the road.  It appears that he attempted steering the truck back onto the highway before it came to a stop with the trailer detached and laying behind it.  Due to the impact with the other vehicle, the tank carrying 185 bbls of condensate ruptured the right side of the tanker and caused a spill of approximately 176 bbls on the road and into the embankment of the road. The condensate was release upon impact with spillage continuing for about 15 minutes following the accident.  Due to the size of the rupture, about 2 feet by 4 feet, nothing could be done to mitigate the effects of the release.","While it is not known exactly how the driver lost control of the tractor and trailer, we have had a safety meeting since then with current driver stressing the importance of always maintaining control of your vehicle no matter what weather conditions they might face.

Leaking tank car was identified as UTLX 208526 which was currently staged and parked in a rail siding. By 1345 hrs. CDT, 4/17/2013, local F.D./county HazMat repsonders were able to stop the commodity release from UTLX 208526 by securing the camlock cap closure on the liquid line that was found not completely clamped or locked down. Afterwards, contract responders fully closed the liquid line valve and ensured that the camlock closure cap was properly secured. Responders used absorbent padding and applied 'Oil Gator' absorbent to all observed ground spillage which was estimated at 100 gallons or less. A degreaser solution was applied to the spillage on UTLX 208526 and four additional rail cars that incurred commodity spray from UTLX 208526's release. These five rail cars were then pressure washed. Spent cleaning liquids were captured atop protective poly sheeting. An application of Micro-Blaze was also used on ground spillage areas. Spent cleaning materials and the poly sheeting were collected and earmarked for appropriate disposal.  Outage measurement of remaining commodity within UTLX 208526 versus commodity loading calculations indicated a differential of 4381 gallons of commodity possibly lost in transit.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,Yes,TANK CAR,,111A100W,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,22250,BNSF Railway Company,US,

The driver failed to realize that the inground tank was manifolded with another tank and that the manifold was not closed.  The product from the manifolded tank flowed over into the tank that the driver was empting and over filled the compartment of the trailer by approx. 50 gallons of kerosene.  The product ran down the trailer and only impacted asphalt.  The driver immediately stopped the flow of product and accessed his spill kit and started to contain the spill.  SET Environmental was called and responded to the spill for remediation.,Our safety manager spoke to the driver and relayed the importance of verifing all tanks when doing a pump out.

The driver stated he saw another vehicle coming toward him and started to ease over to the right to ensure enough room to pass. As he was pulling to the right, he rubbed the guard rail and then dropped off the shoulder. He tried to correct and get back on the road but could not. The truck struck a few guard rails and a Utility pole and then rolled coming to rest on the passenger side. The utility lines were live and still on the vehicle. The driver had to be extricated by the Paducah Fire once the lines were disconnected by Paducah Power. Driver was taken to the local hospital for checking. KY Commercial Vehicle Enforcement also responded to the scene.  The contents of 356 batteries spilled out of the box truck.  A call was made back to main headquarters, East Penn Manufacturing Co., Lyons Station, PA for further help on clean up. An Environmental Contractor was called to the scene for clean  up. The National Response Center was notified a long with the Kentucky DEP. By the time the Environmental contractor got to the scene the wrecker service had begun off-loading the batteries from the box truck. The Environmental Contractor indicated that there were engine oils that also released due to the incident.   East Penn Mfg was working on getting a replacement truck to reload the batteries since the box truck was completely damaged and the cargo could not be reloaded back onto the original box truck. Holderfield Battery was also sending help to determine the status of the batteries.  The leaking batteries were placed into individual poly bags and repalletized. The ""good' batteries will need to be wiped down due to the acid that spilled on them.  A neutralizing solution  was made to apply to the released battery acid.  The box truck was uprighted  and the Environmental Contractor neutralized the released acid that was visible on the truck and the surrounding area. The Consignee of the load sent a truck to reload the batteries.  The batteries will be stationed at the consignee overnight for Holder field employees to go through them to determine which ones are OK for sale and which ones will be sold as seconds and which ones will go back to East Penn Mfg for proper disposal at their secondary lead smelter.  After all the batteries were repalletized and reloaded the Environmental Contractor continued the clean up of the diesel fuel/engine oil.  Drums of hazardous waste were created.  One drum contained diesel fuel, antifreeze and motor oil debris.  the other drums contained cleaned up battery acid contaminated material. The Environmental Contractor will take care of proper testing of the drums for proper disposal.",EAST PENN DOES NOT HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OR CHANGES TO PREVENT RECURRENCE.

Manway cover securement bolts appeared to be tool tight.    Shipper, Eighty-Eight Oil LLC, contracted with emergency response contractor Hepaco-React to correct and remediate the car.  Hepaco-React's inspection included loosening the manway cover securement bolts and opening the manway cover.  Noted the manway cover gasket noted with large/deep grooves in various areas of the gasket.  One of the manway cover securement bolt washers was cupped, possibly due to force associated with use of a pneumatic tool to tighten the manway cover securement bolts.  It was determined that the cupped washer caused it to hang up in the bolt's threads, whereby prohibiting the securement nut from being adequately secured.    Manway nozzle was wiped clean and manway cover was resecured tool tight by use of wrench.

Based on observed damage to the tank trailer, the estimated duration of the release was approximately 20 minutes. The interstate highway (I-26) was closed for approximately 12 hours. Upon being notified of the incident, Pope Transport Company management contacted Highlands Environmental Solutions, Inc. (HES) for emergency spill response and remediation services. Personnel from HES and a subcontractor responded to the scene on the date of the incident. The vehicle wreckage was removed, and pooled petroleum product was recovered. Environmental remediation activities began within two days of the date of the incident, after permission to proceed was received from the South Carolina Department of Transportation. Site remediation activities included: Recovery and removal of pooled petroleum product, removal of petroleum-impacted vegetation, removal of petroleum-impacted soil, and backfill/restoration of the excavated area. Environmental remediation activities were completed within two weeks of the date of the incident.",Remedial driver training.,Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 406,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,803000,HIGHLANDS ENV SOLUTIONS INC,US,

THE OPERATOR TERRY PETERSON IS A VETERAN OF PUTTING ON NH3. HE BEEN APPLYING NH3 FOR OVER 25 YEARS WITH A VERY CLEAN SAFETY RECORD. HE WAS DRIVING OUR JD TRACTOR AND TOOLBAR AND PULLING A TWIN 1000 GALLON TANK. IT WAS EARLY AFTERNOON ON TUESDAY THE 30TH OF APRIL. TERRY WAS DRIVING WEST ON CTY RD 3 AND PROCEEDED SOUTH ON 3. AS HE WAS DRIVING STRAIGHT AHEAD ON 3 ABOUT 19MPH HE WENT ABOUT A 1/4 TO A 1/3 OF A MILE AND LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD. ALL OF A SUDDEN HE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND THE TANK WAS ALREADY PARTIALLY IN THE DITCH, AND THE WHEEL BASE OF THE TANK IS NARROWER THAN BOTH THE TOOLBAR AND THE TRACTOR. AS THE TANK WENT INTO THE DITCH ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE ROAD, THE END OF THE TANK'S HITCH WHERE THE PIN GOES IN BROKE OFF (WHERE THE TWO PIECES OF METAL CONNECT TO THE TONGUE), AND THE TANK THEN ROLLED OVER ONTO ITS TOP UPSIDE DOWN. HE THEN DROVE ABOUT 100 FEET AND PULLED OVER. HE CALLED FARM COUNTRY COOP'S OFFICE IN PINE ISLAND TO INFORM US OF THE PROBLEM. HE THEN WALKED BACK TO THE TANK AND IT WAS LEAKING. THERE WAS A SMALL CLOUD OF GAS, SO TERRY KNEW IT WAS LEAKING A LITTLE. THE WIND WAS 15 MPH OUT OF THE WEST BLOWING THE GAS OVER THE ROAD AND AWAY FROM THE TANK. 911 WAS CALLED IMMEDIATELY. A WOMAN WHO LIVED IN THE HOUSE LOCATED 60-70 YARDS AWAY ALSO ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE ROAD CAME OUT TO SEE WHATS GOING ON. TERRY TOLD HER THAT HER AND HER HUSBAND SHOULD LEAVE THE SCENE AS A PRECAUTION. THE  POLICE WERE THERE WITHIN 15 MINUTES, AND FIVE MINUTES LATER THE BRYON FIRE DEPARTMENT VOLUNTEERS WERE ON THE SCENE. THE POLICE OFFICER ON THE SCENE SAID THAT NO TICKETS WOULD BE ISSUED. THE WITNESS BEHIND THE UNIT THOUGHT THE TANK WAS TRAVELLING STRAIGHT AND NORMAL.  2. THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT/RELEASE IS STILL UNCLEAR, BUT WHAT WE KNOW IS THIS. THE SHOULDERS OF  THE BLACKTOP ROAD ARE SOFT, AND ALSO NARROW. THE ROAD IS ITSELF JUST A TWO LANE, AND WE NORMALLY HAVE TO RUN THE SHOULDER TO FIT DOWN THE ROAD. THE TANK'S TIRES ALWAYS END UP ON THE SHOULDER AT TIMES, AND IN THIS INSTANCE BECAUSE THE SHOULDER WAS NARROW AT ONLY 2 FEET OF WIDTH, THE TANK'S TIRES CAUGHT THE EDGE OF THE SHOULDER AND TERRY MAY HAVE COMPENSATED TO GET TOWARDS THE CENTER ROAD. THE TWO PIECES OF METAL WITH THE HOLES IN THEM ON THE END OF THE TONGUE WERE FINE, BUT WHERE THEY ATTACH TO THE TONGUE IS WHERE IT BROKE OFF. LOOKING AT THE METAL WHERE THEY BROKE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS NOT 100% GOOD METAL LEFT. THE CONNECTION HAD A POSSIBLE WEAK AREA IN IT. THIS WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO NOTICE UNLESS IT BROKE. NOW IF YOU CONSIDER THE STEEPNESS OF THE AREA, IT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A FACTOR. THE ONE ROLL CAGE DID ITS JOB ON ONE TANK PREVENTING THE VALVES FROM BUSTING OFF, BUT ON THE OTHER TANK THE CAGE BROKE OFF AND THE FRONT VALVE DID BREAK OFF. THE INSIDE PORTION OF THE VALVE SLAMMED SHUT BUT DID ALLOW SOME PRODUCT TO GET BY. IT DID ITS JOB MOSTLY.  3. THE IMPACT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WAS VERY MINIMAL. THERE WERE NO HEALTH ISSUES AT ALL. ALL PEOPLE AT THE SCENE WERE INFORMED OF THE ANHY",PLEASE SEE ATTACHED ORDER TO COMPLY.
