There were 3 tanks sitting next to the garage.  One was a 275-gallon caged empty tote.  The middle tank was the 800-gallon tank with a yellow substance.  And the tank on the right was a smaller 500-gallon tank that had a darker residue in it.    The 800-gallon tank had a faded sticker on it that was very difficult to read.    The tank was clear and translucent, and the Hawkins employee was able to see that it was half full of a what he thought was bleach  The Hawkins employee noted that the tank was not labeled and told the Nursery secretary that the tank must be properly labeled before he could unload.  The Nursery secretary responded that it would be a good idea to label the tank   The Hawkins employee then labeled the tank with a UN1791 label.  Approx. @ 8:45 a.m. EST:  The Hawkins employee connected his hose (150-feet hose) from the truck that was parked approximately 25-30 feet from tank.    The pump is controlled at the truck – there is an extension cord to the pump and a switch to turn the pump on/off from the passenger seat.  There is a straight visual to the tank from this position.  The Hawkins employee then proceeded to transfer 10 -15 gallons of sodium hypochlorite into the tank.  This took approximately 30-60 seconds.   After about a minute the Hawkins employee noticed a foul odor and saw a translucent gas come off the tank – like what you would see from a gas tank in hot weather.  This was a result of adding Sodium Hypochlorite to a fertilizer tank which created the Vapor (Gas) Dispersion.  The Hawkins employee immediately shut off the pump.  The owner, Pat Ford, ordered the Nursery secretary to evacuate the building and for all the workers in the nursery to move from the immediate area.  During the evacuation, the Nursery secretary told an office coworker (young female) to go look at the tank.  The Hawkins employee told the Nursery secretary that everyone should evacuate the building as soon as possible.  Evacuated were:  3 from the office (including Hawkins employee) as well as various workers that were in the nursery – total of 15-20 evacuated up wind from the release but still on the nursery property.  The nursery is several acres.    Nursery employee called 9-1-1  1 Nursery employee suffered exposure and was transported to the hospital for treatment/evaluation.  The employee was evaluated and released.","1) We pumped out the tainted product from the customer’s tank, and the customer is getting rid of not only that tank (which had product in it that he hadn’t touched in over five years), but also the other older tank and 275 gallon totes that were in the same vicinity.  2) We are switching the customer over from mini-bulking sodium hypochlorite into his empty 15 GA deldrums, to bringing him 15 gallon deldrum's that will be filled in our warehouse and exchanging them with the empties – no more filling mini-bulk tanks on site.",No,IBC CONTAINER,"Container, no IBC type given",CONT IBC,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,20,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,0,"HAWKINS, INC.",US,

Vinton, LA 70668 north of Vinton, LA.  The vehicle involved was a tractor and tanker-trailer (Tiger Fuel Tractor Unit #1238 & Trailer Unit #5), with the tanker-trailer containing approximately 6,002 gross gallons of Gasoline (UN1203, Class 3, PGII) and approximately 2,500 gross gallons of Diesel (UN1993, Class 3, PG III) for a total of 8,502 gross gallons of automotive gasoline and diesel. Due to the nature of the crash, the vehicle came to rest inverted in the ditch on the north side of the road.  Tiger Fuel Inc.  dispatch was notified at approximately 0700 hours by Louisiana State Police who advised of the vehicle crash and that the driver was pinned in the overturned vehicle. It was later learned that Louisiana State Police (LSP) and Calcasieu Parish Sheriff’s Office (CPSO) both responded to the scene.  CPSO investigated the crash with the crash report unavailable at this time due to the Hurricane Laura recovery and CPSO clerks not having returned to their office.  The circumstances which resulted in the crash are undetermined at this time pending the release of the CPSO crash report.  OMI Environmental Solutions, LLC Belle Chase, LA was contacted as the spill mitigation contractor for clean-up of the scene. The diesel and gasoline reportedly leaked from the vents with no reported bulkhead or valve leaks.  The diesel and gasoline recovered from the scene was approximately 200 gallons as reported initially by OMI Environmental Solutions and the rest was successfully transferred to another Tiger Fuel tanker trailer without incident.  The vehicle was equipped with spill mitigation material however due to the driver being both pinned and injured, he was unable to deploy the material.  Pending the release of the crash report, it is believed that LSP and CPSO closed Bigwoods Edgerly Road to all traffic both northbound and southbound while the spill was mitigated with sand, socks and mats and while the tanker’s contents was removed via pump and hose to another tanker. OMI related they would conduct an analysis of the recovered product to determine the proper disposal method.  OMI also related that they revisited the site the next day, 9-3-2020, to replace the socks and mats with fresh absorbent material to help mitigate the remaining product in the ditch. No fire resulted from the crash. The driver (Ryan Parker) was airlifted to Lafayette General Hospital and was released later that day with the driver relating injuries to his shoulder and hip. The tractor and trailer were righted and then removed from the scene by Harmon’s Automotive & Towing Service, Inc. Lake Charles, LA.  Ann Bartholomew contacted LSP Spill Notification hotline at approximately 1015 hours on 9-2-2020.  PHMSA NRC was notified by telephone at approximately 1012 hours on 9-2-2020, NRC Report #128-6331. Pending the release of the CPSO crash report, t","Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana is currently in recovery from Hurricane Laura and record clerks have not returned to their office facilities.

The car was isolated and the shipper, National Response Center, and West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection were notified.  (CHEMTREC Report #2020-0907-00023). Specialized Professional Services, Inc., a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the scene and confirmed a vapor release from a broken bottom outlet valve flange to tank car connection. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper's representative, Mr. Kendrick Bowen, phone 214-577-1046 . Contractor personnel cleaned all liquid product from the exterior of the valve, wrapped it in poly sheeting, and installed a spill pan reservoir. The car's contents were transferred on 9/10/2020. As of this report, the tank car remains on hold in the CSX Parkersburg Yard awaiting repair from an AAR authorized MRU.  This incident did not require a special switching move. 7.1 will be submitted.  Cause Code: 543 - ***Note*** - the Mounting Flange gasket was misaligned due to the mounting flange being cracked.

The cylinder originated from a household collection event in Los Angeles County.  The cylinder was packaged in a 55 gallon open top poly drum with absorbent and was closed with a drum lid.   The cylinder arrived at our Veolia Fremont 10 day transfer facility, an employee was preparing to transfer the package to the destination trailer.  The employee was removing a 55 gallon open top poly drum which contained the cylinder in question off the pallet.  This drum was double stacked and during the process of lowering the drum, the cylinder's valve opened which caused the drum to pressurize.  The employee heard the hissing of the cylinder and took shelter behind a concrete wall as the drum lid blew off.  The release from the cylinder caused the vermiculite to spread throughout the warehouse.   Once the lid popped off, the employee turned the valve about a quarter turn to close the valve.  Employee added additional vermiculite into the drum to secure the cylinder. Employee swept up the vermiculite but since the cylinder contained breathing air, there was no need to do any further spill clean up.  The estimated duration was 2 minutes of release time.","Based on the results of the investigation, the cause of the release was from a combination of loose valve where the vibration caused during the normal course of transportation along with drum handling may have caused the valve to loosen up and open during the impact of lower.  The employee who managed the incident mentioned that the valve was very easy to open and close.    Veolia reviewed the incident with the employees who packaged and shipped the material and a formal training was done on 9/14/2020 for all of its employees in California.  The training included proper securement of cylinders and overpack guidelines.  In addition, they have been reminded to always verify that the cylinders are properly closed securely prior to shipment.",No,CYLINDER,"Cylinder, a pressure vessel for compressed gases",CYL,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"VEOLIA ES TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS, L.L.C.",US,

The driver took it upon himself to hang a bucket from the piping using zip ties due to how windy it was.   He was afraid if he set it on the ground that the wind would have blown it past the catch bucket.  When offloading was complete he had to use one hand to cut the zip tie and the other arm had to try and support the weight of the bucket with product in it which he couldn't at that angle and the bucket slammed to the ground.  Approximately 1 gallon splashed up from the bucket on to his PPE and up under his face shield on to his face / lips.  He went for the shower and as he was trying to reach up it pulled the sleep of his chemical jacket away from his chemical gloves and am impacted area of chemical on his suit made contact with his wrist.  We sent him to a hospital where he was treated and released.  The next day he advised he was feeling 100% normal.  We've followed up again and reconfirmed he is doing good.,Our training is to put buckets and spill pads down on the ground under every connection in case of leaks or accidental releases.  The driver was coached that anytime something is actively leaking to work with the safety team as this defect is a component we likely could have gotten fixed with the trailer loaded after we verified it was safe to do so.  Additionally we coached the driver on not trying to zip tie buckets to piping to get it closer to the source.

It is determined the leak occurred due to the slight incline; material had passed the top overflow valve filling up the hoses and plumbing. Material from hoses was drained into a drum and pumped back into the vessel.  Valve closure was  checked and confirmed close with no drips.  Unit was then sent to be offloaded then placed  out of service.  Unit was then sent directly to tank maintenance facility  for inspection and repair. Findings indicate the internal bypass valve was completely eroded and deteriorated.  Internal valve  was replaced.  Unit then tested and confirm appropriate operation.","While we do not permit or require our drivers to inspect valves, we will ask that they do not park at a slope.

Hepaco was dispatched to perform cleanup activities. Hepaco personnel arrived onsite and reported the asphalt roadway, soil shoulder alongside the roadway and a drain had been impacted by approximately 50 gallons of liquid asphalt. The contractor reported roughly 6-8 inches of hardened liquid asphalt was present in the drain and some had migrated into a main line. The released liquid asphalt that had impacted the roadway and soil shoulder was collected and placed into six (6) 55 – gallon metal drums and one (1) 95 – gallon metal drum. Hepaco personnel utilized a vacuum truck to flush out the impacted drain. Approximately 750 gallons of impacted liquids were collected in the vacuum truck.   On September 18, 2020, Hepaco personnel returned to the site to complete site restoration activities. A lane closure was set up and then the contractor performed dry-ice basting activities for the removal of the hardened asphalt. Hepaco personnel recovered the debris into four (4) 55 – gallon metal drums. The contractor also pressure washed the area to further reduce the residue present. Approximately 750 gallons of impacted liquids were collected with the vacuum truck from pressure washing activities. Hepaco personnel then departed the site.   On October 7, 2020, Hepaco personnel returned to the site to finish decontaminating the impacted drain. The contractor utilized a vacuum truck with a hot-steam pressure washer to further remove the residual asphalt present in the drains. Approximately 1,000 gallons of impacted liquids were recovered with the vacuum truck. The hot-steam was able to break up the asphalt into smaller pieces, recovered by the vacuum truck.

The next morning, he went to unhook trailer and noticed wetness underneath trailer at axles and a strong smell. Upon opening trailer doors, he discovered material on trailer floor. No material was released onto the ground. HazMat contacted Haz-Mat One for the response, who contracted First Call Environmental close by to responq· Upon investigation by First Call Env., it was discovered that the fiber side wall of one of the drums started separating from bottom ring, blew out and expanded from the apparent weight of the drum. There was a visible 4-5"" vertical split up the side of the drum. The Ieaking container was overpacked and all cleanup debris/material was put in two additional drums which were placed back on the trailer to be taken to the designated consignee for the shipment.","1)The drum itself was not available for inspection. Per the shipper's request, the container should be shipped back to them to inspect.. 2) The drum specification was reviewed and the manufacturer contacted. The drum should hold 600 lbs., is rated for packing group Il or Ill, and is Iaminated fiberboard inside. DuPont typically does not fill the drum with more than 400 lbs. 3) DuPont will double the amount of absorbent in each drum and will also put 3 Iiners in each drum. Operators will write their initials and the date on the sides of the drums, which will help when conducting post-incident investigations. 6) The daily audit process has been upgraded to check the drums for Iiners and amount of absorbent prior to being filled. 7) In the short term, DuPont will conduct an audit of 3 drums(1 drum from 3 different pallets) per shipment on 9/28/20 and 9/29/20 prior to putting the drums on HazMat's trailer.The standard practice to prepare the acid gel drums and a daily audit checklist have been modified to prevent recurrence.",No,DRUM NON-METAL,Fiber drum,1G,No,,,,,,,104,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"HAZMAT ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP,LR¤",US,

Hardened foam encased the bottles. The bottles were wrapped in plastic, and were cracked, allowing the leak. The spilled liquid had saturated the fibreboard under the outer tape.Paper labeling with the bottles and a Commercial Invoice associated with the shipment identified the leaking substance as 1-ethylcyclopentyl 2-chloroacetate produced by the shipper Vanamali Organics Pvt. Ltd. The invoice indicated 2 KG of the commodity was in the package. Subsequent to discovery the recipient company was contacted, and the recipient provided an SDS obtained from the shipper. The SDS indicated the commodity was not regulated for transport, but the flashpoint was listed as 20 C and the boiling point was listed as 76 C. These characteristics were indicative of a flammable liquid. There were no dangerous goods markings or labels on the package and no Shippers Declaration for Dangerous Goods was offered with the shipment.Following discovery, the ramp was directed by Dangerous Goods Administration to have FedEx Spill Cleanup staff contain the shipment in a salvage drum and hold it pending further disposition instruction.

The container was found on its side inside of the transport vehicle. An internal investigation was immediately launched. The determination of the leading causes to the load shift was inconclusive. Our internal investigation concluded that there may have been an oblique closure of the container lid, resulting in a small gap, which was believed to have been the primary cause of the leak. The material did not leave the truck bed and was not released to the environment. The leaked amount was cleaned off the container and truck bed and disposed of properly.

Shipment left our Wixom MI facility and was headed to a Battery Recyder in Carson City NV. All Material was packaged compliantly, labeled compliantly, marked compliantly. Truck was no placarded( Shipping under the class 9 exception). Lithium was properly terminally protected, use of bags, drum Iiners, inner cushioning material( Vermiculite). Truck was loaded and secured adequately/compliantly. All Bill of Iadings, paperwork, pre ship inspections were completed per regulations. There was no reason to assume or indicate any danger. Lithium batteries have been known to fail/ have internal defects that are undetectable, this is an educated risk of being a waste handler, battery recycler. A lithium battery may go internal thermal runaway even when packaged compliantly, loaded and hauled compliantly, and without visible signs of defect or damage. None of this material was classified as damaged. Since the carrier was 10-12 miles away when incident occurred, and Battery Solutions has a relationship with Brighton Area fire, we sent staff on site to assist and offer help. It was assumed, since the carrier was in possession of the material, that the carrier made an NRC call. Typically this would have been hundreds of miles away, it just happened to be close to our facility. Relatively little damage to material( 2-3 pallets), but the FD had to open the trailer to get to the pallets. TBD damage on carriers trailer. The FD asked Battery Solutions to transload the material and escorted it back to our facility where re re-inspected and repackaged the material. a DOT representative was on site, and was pleased with the handling of the bumt material and the removal. the 196/ Kensington Rd interchange was closed for a few hours to properly transload the material and remove from the highway. Follow up Photos of re-packaging, including All documents, paperwork were sent to Darus Pruter witb the DOT and we were told the case would be closed. US Ecology Sampled the soil for release, no caustic materials found, disposal-6f the bumt materialwill be through US Ecology via incineration and the rest of the material has been re-packaged and will go on to original consigned, Redwood Materials in Carson City NV.","Packaging was completely compliant and safe.

As a result, approximately 4 gallons of UN1263 was released to the trailer floor and further migrated to the concrete parking lot. RLC retained Cura Emergency Services, LC(CES) to manage the cleanup. CES dispatched a crew from Environmental Works(EW) to perform the necessary corrective action. EW personnel utilized plug and dike to patch the hole in the damaged 55-gallon drum of UN1263. Crews then deployed granular absorbents to the freestanding liquid and worked them in using hand tools. All UN1263 impacted material was collected and containerized in one(1) 55-gallon drum for transport and disposal.

Eric was offloading into the NL Regular tank when the uncapped Prem tank drop tube filled up with fuel and started gushing out onto the parking lot down the street and into a storm drain. He shut off the belly valve and then had to wait for the pressure to subside before he could put the cap back on the prem drop tube. Appx 200 gallons traveled underground to a creek nearby and then travel appx 800 yrds downstream. The FD responded and placed a boom across the Creek to prevent the fuel from spreading farther. TAS Environmental was contracted and vacuumed the top of the creek and placed in a frac tank set up nearby to transfer to. The vapor recovery lines between the 2 tanks are manifolded and the Driver failed to properly connect the vapor recovery to his trailer causing pressure in the NL tank to travel through the vapor line to the Prem tank allowing pressure to build up inside pushing Prem out through the open 4"" drop tube.",-Customer is testing the UST Vaccum Vapor Vents on both the Reg and Premium Gasoline Tanks.  Driver Safety Meeting Held on 9-30-20 -Drivers reminded to ensure Vapor Recovery connections are properly attached prior to delivering fuel. -Drivers reminded to not leave any tank openings uncapped except to stick tank/attach or detach tank drop fittings. -Drivers reminded to stand next to tank compartment belly valves (to close trailer compartments immediately in the event of a fuel spill).,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,37400,World Fuel Services,US,

He arrived at the customers main gate at approximately 10:30am and checked in with customer security. After returning to his truck, he noticed liquid underneath his trailer on the pavement. Upon inspection he determined that approximately 2 gallons of sulfuric acid 93% had leaked from the dome lid on compartment 2 of his trailer. The driver notified his supervisor and the customer of the incident. The driver then contained and neutralized the area underneath his trailer. The customer called local fire department and dispatched to the scene as well as a county hazardous material specialist. After multiple phone conversations with the local fire chief, I was informed that a storm drain that flows to a customer pond had been impacted by the release as well as two additional areas on San Pablo Ave near the customer site. At this time CHP responded to the scene and limited alternating lane closures for a short time. No further action was needed at the storm drain for it was determined that the spillage didn't reach the pond after testing the pH. An environmental response team was contracted by Univar Solutions for clean up of the impacted areas and trailer. After the clean up, product was transferred from the leaking tanker into another tanker. We determined that the gasket coating was incompatible with the product.",1. Ensure gaskets are compatible with products before putting trailers into service.  2. Ensure dome gaskets are thoroughly inspected prior to loading and closing lid.  3.
