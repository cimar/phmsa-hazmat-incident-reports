WAS BEING PUT TO THE DOCK TO UNLOAD A SHIPMENT FOR MEDFORD BEFORE PROCEEDING TO KLAMATH FALLS. MEDFORD P & D DRIVER JAMES WEHREN NOTICED A LIQUID LEAKING FROM THE REAR OF THE TRAILER. THE LID HAD COME COMPLETELY OFF A 3015 LB TOTE AND THE ROCKING MOTION OF THE TRAILER CAUSED THE LIQUID TO SPILL OVER THE SIDES AND ONTO THE SURROUNDING FREIGHT. ALTHOUGH THE LIQUID WAS NOT LISTED AS AN INHALATION HAZARD IT HAD AN EXTREMELY OBNOXIOUS ODOR SO THE TRAILER WAS LEFT IN THE YARD TO VENTILATE WITH THE DOOR OPEN. THE SPILL CENTER WAS CALLED ALONG WITH MEL STRAND. DENNIS WERNER WITH VAN WATERS & ROGERS, (THE SHIPPER) AUTHORIZED MEL TO OVERPACK ANY CONTAMINATION AND SEND IT TO THEIR MOBILE, ALABAMA LOCATION. FIRST STRIKE ENVIRONMENTAL WAS CALLED TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL. JIM ROLES WAS THE FIRST STRIKE EMPLOYEE THAT SUPERVISED THE CLEAN UP EFFORT. ACCORDING TO MR. ROLES THE SPILL WAS CAUSED BY A WORN OUT RING CLAMP BOLT. THE TOTE WAS CLEANED AND FORWARDED TO THE CONSIGNEE.
