The driver notified 911 and both he and the store personnel immediately stopped all traffic in area and began cleanup while awaiting emergency assistance.    Review of the veeter root system information reflects that the product began flow at 12:55pm and stopped at 1:05pm with an increase of 35 gallons. This information is helpful in supporting the driver statement that the connections were made to both the storage tank and trailer compartment before opening the internal valve for flow.",An unannounced observation was conducted on the driver for a delivery 3 weeks prior and all aspects of delivery was proper. Inspection of the delivery hose and connectors was done to ensure that they were at standards. At this point it appears that driver error was made either when the camlocks on the fittings were not locked in or that a gasket had fallen out of the fitting before connection. Driver has reviewed again the importance of verifying that connection are secured before starting the delivery flow.,No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,10232,PS Marston Associates,US,

When our driver reached the back of the trailer, the pallet jack slid off the liftgate causing the IBC to fall off and land on its top.  The impact of hitting the ground caused the side of the IBC to split open and it entire contents to drain out.  The contents of the IBC ran out on the paved driveway and into a rock lined drainage ditch alongside of the driveway.  The City of Dayton notified the fire department of the spill, they responded with their hazmat team.  The spill was neutralized using lime and inert materials.  We brought in a remediation contractor to cleanup the spill and restore the site to its original condition.","Further training to prevent incidents of this nature include the following,  1.

The safety (B.A.S.E.) system on the cargo tank was shut down, thus all valves (i.e. internal, snappy joe, etc.) were closed. The driver did not properly disconnect the 1"" X 100' delivery hose prior to pulling away, which resulted in an unsafe line break (at the customer's tank connection), a release of anhydrous ammonia (21 lbs./vaporization is immediate so actual duration of release is unknown), and property damage to both the customer's and Airgas' equipment. The leak was mitigated by safety valves on both ends of the system (excess flow valve shut on customer's fill connection/internal and snappy joe valves on Airgas' discharge line shut). The driver tested all connections where stress was applied as a result of the pull-away, and no leaks were present. No authorities were called to the site, and Musashi returned to normal operation after a 1 hr. evacuation of approximately 100-500 employees. The driver was directed to leave the site shortly thereafter by area manager, Michael Jones.","Established Airgas SOP A-03 specifically states that all delivery hoses are to be disconnected prior to pulling away. No recommendations will be made regarding the content of that particular SOP.

Preston Rd,Pasadena,TX,77503,Shipper,"On October 17, 2016 a Marathon Pipe Line owned and operated vacuum truck carrying petroleum crude oil was involved in a one vehicle roll-over accident in Wyoming.  Immediate notification under 49 CFR 171.5 was provided to NRC based on the driver being admitted to a hospital.  After further review, immediate notification was not required s the accident was a direct result of the hazardous material but rather from the truck rollover and damage to the truck cabin.  Additionally, a written report under 49 CFR 171.6 would not have been required based on meeting the reporting exceptions under 49 CFR 171.16(d)(2)(iii)-(iv) for a release less than 5.2 gallons.  While the incident would not have met the immediate reporting requirements, a written report is therefore required.  No release occurred from the tank itself (lading system).  An amount less than one gallon of crude oil was released from a one foot 3"" rubber ""muffler"" hose located between the tank muffler and scrubber tank.  This hose can collect crude oil mist residues during operation of the tanker truck and is capped with a camlock cap.  It is drained as necessary and would not allow a release from the tank.  An estimated 4 gallons of diesel fuel was also released from the trucks saddle tank which is not subject to reporting.  The spilled crude oil and diesel contaminated soil was picked up for proper disposal.  The tanker truck was removed from the site and taken to our Chatham Station south of Worland, WY.  NOTES: The ""police"" report number is for Wyoming Highway Patrol.  Response cost includes cost to haul off damaged truck as well as to empty the tank to recover crude oil.",Marathon Pipe Line is in the process of conducting a TapRoot investigation to better understand the cause and provide recommendations to prevent recurrence.

While unloading the sea container, a 30 gallon open top drum was found with the lid blown off the top of drum. Whatever reaction took place must have happened while the container was on the ship at sea.  There was no evidence that any liquid or solid hazardous waste was release from the sea container. Furthermore, no liquid or solid residue was seen outside the drum. Whatever reaction took place utilized all the waste involved in the reaction. The vermiculite absorbent material was blown from the drum as well. There were a total of 9 smaller containers (ranging from pint to gallon) inside the 30 gallon drum. The other smaller inner containers were all constructed of metal. Some of the small containers were also blown out of the drum but none of the smaller containers were compromised.     No liquids were released from the drum. There was a stain left on the wall of the container from the reaction. The initial clean-up involved sweeping up all of the vermiculite absorbent and placing it back in the drum as well as any small containers blown from the drum.  All of the smaller containers were eventually consolidated into other containers for shipment off-site.",It is unknown what caused the material in the drum to react.

I reported this issue to BNSF mechanical foreman John Ohlman at the time of  my inspection. I did not replace the security seal that I removed from the protective housing since BNSF personnel will need to perform repairs inside the protective housing.""  BNSF Hazmat Team members isolated the car from the train and inspected the car.  The VRV was removed from the pressure plate and a blind flange was installed in place to secure the leak.  The VRV was fastened to a valve for the car owner/shop to conduct additional inspection and testing on the defective valve.  An OTMA was obtained by PBF Energy for the trip to shop for repairs.  Estimated release volumes are only estimates based upon information provided by the field.",The shipper should ensure that all appliances are in conformance with the tank car specification and leak free prior to release.
