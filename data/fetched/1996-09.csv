THE SHIPMENT CONTAINED RESTAURANT SUPPLIES, WHICH INCLUDED GLASSWARE, PAPER PRODUCTS, LATEX GLOVES, COFFEE POTS, CANNED GOODS, ETC. AS WELL AS CLEANING SUPPLIES THAT WERE CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. *******  ON SEPTEMBER 18, 1996 AT APPROXIMATELY 0600, OUR DRIVER WAS TRAVELING WEST ON NEBRASKA INTERSTATE I-80 WHEN SHE HEARD THREE SMALL EXPLOSIONS COMING FROM THE TRAILER SHE WAS PULLING.  AFTER HEARING THE EXPLOSIONS, THE DRIVER PULLED OFF ONTO EXIT RAMP 426 TO INVESTIGATE WHAT SHE HAD HEARD.  THE DRIVER DISCOVERED FLAMES COMING FROM AROUND THE AREA OF THE FIFTH WHEEL OF THE TRACTOR.  THE DRIVER IMMEDIATELY OBTAINED HER FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND ATTEMPTED TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE.  WHILE WORKING ON THE FIRE AN ACE HARDWARE TRUCK DRIVER STOPPED TO ASSIST AND USED HIS FIRE EXTINGUISHER TO ATTEMPT TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE.  A CAR ALSO STOPPED AND THE DRIVER UTILIZED THEIR CAR PHONE TO CONTACT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THE DRIVER WAS NOT ABLE TO UNHOOK THE TRACTOR FROM THE TRAILER DUE TO THE INTENSITY OF THE FIRE. *******  BY THE TIME THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON THE SCENE, THE TRACTOR TRAILER WERE BOTH ENGULFED IN FLAMES AND TRACTOR, TRAILER AND CONTENTS WERE A TOTAL LOSS.  THE INTERSTATE WAS CLOSED FOR THREE TO FOUR HOURS FOR SAFETY PURPOSES UNTIL THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED AND CLEAN-UP PROCEDURES WERE IN PLACE.  AT 0945 A CLEAN-UP CONTRACTOR ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND AT 1030 ONE LANE OF WESTBOUND INTERSTATE 80 WAS RE-OPENED TO TRAFFIC.  ********* THE DEBRIS FROM THE FIRE WAS PLACED IN DUMPSTERS AND STORED UNTIL A DECISION COULD BE MADE AS TO WHERE THE MATERIAL COULD BE DISPOSED OF.  THE CONTENTS OF THE DUMPSTERS WOULD BE SORTED AT A LATER DATE AND ANY HAZARDOUS MATERIAL OR MATERIAL WHICH COULD CAUSE HARM TO THE ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE SORTED AND DISPOSED OF AS HAZARDOUS WASTE.  THE REMAINDER OF THE SOLID WASTE IN THE DUMPSTERS WOULD BE TESTED AND IF PERMISSIBLE THE MATERIAL WILL BE DISPOSED OF IN A LANDFILL.  SOIL WHICH HAD BEEN CONTAMINATED BY WATER THAT HAD BEEN USED TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE WAS REMOVED FROM THE AREA AND WILL ALSO BE DISPOSED OF PROPERLY ONCE ALL THE TEST RESULTS ARE IN.  ******** AT 1800 THE SECOND LANE ON THE INTERSTATE WAS RE-OPENED TO TRAFFIC, HOWEVER, THE EXIT RAMP REMAINED CLOSED UNTIL 0100 THE NEXT MORNING AFTER ALL THE CONTAMINATED SOIL WAS REMOVED.

THIS FUEL IS DISPENSED TO CG&E CREW TRUCKS DURING THE NIGHT SO THAT THE VEHICLES ARE READY FOR ELECTRIC AND GAS SERVICE OPERATIONS IN THE MORNING. AFTER FILLING THE CARGO TANK WITH DIESEL, THE DRIVER DEPARTED THE FACILITY FOR CG&E'S DANA AVENUE FACILITY (2004 DANA AVENUE).

THE SPILL WAS CONFINED TO THE STREET SURFACE AND DID NOT IMPACT WATERWAYS, SEWERS, OR EARTH. CG&E DISCOVERED THE SPILL AT ABOUT 2:05 A.M. AND PROMPTLY DISPATCHED A CLEAN-UP CREW TO SPREAD ABSORBENT CLAY OVER OILY AREAS AND RECOVER AS MUCH OF THE SPILL OIL AS POSSIBLE. THE TRUCK DRIVER WAS CONTACTED AT DANA AVENUE AND PROMPTLY CHECKED HIS TRUCK, THEN RETRACED HIS ENTIRE ROUTE TO SEARCH FOR ANY ADDITIONAL SPILLED MATERIAL. EVALUATION OF THE CARGO TANK'S FUEL INVENTORY LED TO THE DETERMINATION THAT A MAXIMUM OF 19 GALLONS WERE SPILLED.

CARL BENNETT, MESQUITE DRIVER, WAS DRIVING HIS TRACTOR-TRAILER, APPROXIMATELY 35 MILES PER HOUR, WEST ON I-635, IN THE RIGHT LANE, PREPARING TO EXIT AT MIDWAY ROAD. JUST PRIOR TO MIDWAY ROAD THE DALLAS NORTH TOLLWAY ENTERS I-635. THERE IS A LONG ENTRANCE RAMP WITH A WIDE BUTTONED OFF AREA DIVIDING THE RAMP FROM I-635. A CAR DROVE ACROSS THIS BUTTONED OFF AREA RIGHT IN FRONT OF CARL INTO THE SECOND LANE OVER. CARL HAD TO SLAM ON HIS BRAKES IN ORDER TO KEEP FROM HITTING THE CAR. HE FELT HIS LOAD SHIFT. ** AS HE CONTINUED TOWARD MIDWAY ROAD, HE MOVED INTO THE FAR RIGHT HAND LANE PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL EXIT RAMP. HE LOOKED OUT OF HIS REAR VIEW MIRROR AND SAW LIQUID POURING FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF HIS TRAILER. WHERE HE WAS AT THAT TIME, THE ROAD TILTS BACK TOWARD I-635 SO CARL QUICKLY MOVED FURTHER TOWARD THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WERE IT TILTED OFF THE ROAD INSTEAD OF TOWARD I-635. HE PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND STOPPED. ** HE WENT TO THE RIGHT OF HIS TRAILER AND CAREFULLY OPENED THE SIDE DOOR. MORE OF THE SPILLED PRODUCT RAN OUT THE DOOR. THE SPILLED PRODUCT APPEARED TO BE ACID, BUT HE COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS LEAKING. HE OPENED THE BACK DOORS BUT STILL COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS LEAKING, BUT HE COULD SEE IT WAS NOT THE TOTES. HE WENT BACK TO THE CAB OF HIS TRUCK TO CALL THE OPERATION MANAGER, DON DIXON, AND CHECK THE SHIPPING PAPERS FOR WHAT THE PRODUCT MIGHT BE. FROM LOOKING AT THE SHIPPING PAPERS HE DEDUCTED THAT THE SPILLED PRODUCT WAS PROBABLY MAYOQUEST 1500--CORROSIVE LIQUID, N.O.S. (1-HYDROXYETHYLIDENE-1, 1-DIPHOSPHONIC ACID), 8, CORROSIVE, UN1760, PG111. HE CALLED DON AND TOLD HIM THAT HE THOUGHT THE SPILLED PRODUCT WAS MAYOQUEST 1500. DON HAD A. ABDULLAH, ANOTHER MESQUITE DRIVER, DRIVE A BOB-TAIL WITH ANOTHER PALLET JACK TO THE SCENE. DON AND LEON PAGE, DIRECTOR, DROVE TO THE SCENE IN DON'S VAN. ** SOMEONE ELSE MUST HAVE CALLED 911 BECAUSE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT SHOWED UP WHILE CARL WAS ON THE PHONE. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 7:05 TO 7:10 A.M. CARL AND THE FIREMAN CRAWLED INTO THE BACK OF THE TRAILER. A TOTE HAD PRESSED UP AGAINST A SINGLE 55 GALLON DRUM AT MAYOQUEST 1500 AND SPLIT THE DRUM. THE ENTIRE 55 GALLONS HAD LEAKED FROM THE DRUM. ** FRED CHANDLER, VICE PRESIDENT, DROVE BY THE SCENE JUST AFTER IT HAD HAPPENED. WHILE HE LOOPED AROUND AT THE NEXT EXIT TO GET BACK TO THE SCENE, HE CALLED THE OFFICE AND FOUND OUT WHAT THE SPILLED PRODUCT WAS. HE THEN CALLED CALLAWAY, A DIVISION OF VULCAN CHEMICAL, THE MANUFACTURER OF MAYOQUEST. HE GOT THEIR TECHNICAL MAN, STEVE REDDING, ON HIS MOBILE PHONE WHEN HE GOT TO THE SCENE. HE GAVE THE PHONE (AND ALSO HIS EMERGENCY RESPONSE BOOK) TO THE FIREMAN IN CHARGE WHO QUESTION THE CALLAWAY TECHNICAL MAN ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND WHAT TO DO TO SAFELY CLEAN IT UP. ** IN THE MEAN TIME, THE POLICE HAD ARRIVED, BLOCKED OFF TWO LANES OF I-635 PLUS THE EXIT RAMP TO MIDWAY ROAD, AND WERE QUESTIONING CARL.
