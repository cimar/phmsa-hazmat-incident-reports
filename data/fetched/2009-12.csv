Less than 10 minutes.,The delivery driver picked up this trailer loaded and had no idea there may have been product at the dust cap. During his inspection he did verify that all product valves were closed prior to transport.

Vessel notified Horizon Lines. Horizon Lines notified the shipper, Dana Container Inc, to get information on options to address and make arrangements to have one of their technician meet vessel on arrival. Ship took appropriate action to cord-off area, and place containment material to catch drippings. Horizon Lines notified the NRC as per 49 CFR 171.15 requirements.     As a result of multiple conversations between USCG San Juan, Horizon Lines, and Dana the following was set in motion:  1)Ship charged the fire system and hose in the tank’s locations on Hatch 11 above.    2)Dana Technician, Dana Haz Response Representative, and USCG made arrangements to meet vessel at pilot 12/3/09 0500hrs.  On 12/3/09, the Dana Technician found the center tank cover improperly seeded, because the top wing nuts were not equally tightened. This resulted in Hexanes’ drops escaping from the cover to the well and then to drain tube.  Once the wings nuts were equally and properly tighten, the dripping ceased. The tank was slosh tested, and it was found tight.","In light of what came out the dialogue and the technician’s feedback, Dana Containers needs to review their procedures to make sure their personnel are fully aware of how to dog-down this center top cover with the wing nuts. They are to be equally tightened to properly seat the gasket and cover.  This would prevent any future re-occurrence.",No,TANK,Portable tank,TANK PRT,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,710,HORIZON LINES,US,

A response crew was notified.  They donned the appropriate personal protective equipment, entered the trailer and overpacked the leaking drum into a suitable salvage container along with the material used in the clean up.  The leak was caused by the nut and bolt of the lock ring assembly of an adjoining drum puncturing the drum.  The trailer was then unloaded and placed back into service.  The original shipment was loaded onto another trailer and continued to the intended waste disposal facility.  Illinois Emergency Management Authority was notified and assigned case #H20091334 to the incident.","At the time the shipment was accepted for transportation, the driver inspected the load and did not identfy any issues.  It is believed that during transportation, one container shifted allowing it to strike the container next to it causing a small puncture in the body of the container.  In order to prevent a recurrence, the shipper has been notified  and advised that when loading a van trailer, due care and attention must be used to insure that each container is completely impolized to prevent movement in any dircetion.  In addition, care must be taken when loading containers that have protrucing closure devices to insure these devices annot negativelyimpact other lading.

The IBC slid off the forks of the lift truck as it was turning to back down an incline. One leg of the IBC came to rest on level ground while three others came to rest on the incline. This caused the IBC to tip over on its side. The impact with the concrete surface caused the side and the top of the IBC to split releasing the contents. Surface drains in the path of the liquid flow were protected using bags of Sodium Carbonate to form a barrier and prevent entry. Collection of the liquid on the concrete surface bgan using a pump to transfer the material to IBC's and drums. Once the liquid was collected, the Sodium Carbonate used as a barrier and for neutralization was collected and containerized.

The load was checked during each required load check for the 350 mile trip without incident.  Upon arrival at the facility, the load was checked and no leaks were found.  The next morning, when the door to the truck was opened, it was found to have a leaking container from a UN rated fiberboard box.  The employee donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and found a glass bottle inside the box had broken.  The remaining material was placed into a suitable salvage container along with the soaked vermiculite, cardboard box and cleanup materials.  The shipment was then loaded onto a trailer for the intended waste disposal facility.","During the clean-up activities, it was discovered that the inner container was packaged using vermuculite as a cushining and absorbant material but did not adequatley protect the container from damage during transportation.

When doing his required post trip inspection, the driver noticed a small amount of material on the top of one of the drums.  Dock personnel donned the appropriate personal protective equipment and determined that the bung gasket of the leaking drum was defective.  The waste was contained to the top of the drum and was cleaned up using an absorbent material and put back into the drum.  The bung and gasket of the offending drum were replaced.

In addition to the cargo being over-weight, it was also noticed that the cargo lacked the adequate blocking and bracing as required by 49CFR part 176. The container was immediately placed on ""Hold"" status and the shipper was advised of the finding. The shipper was asked to split the cargo into two containers, one containing the hazardous cargo and the other container the non-hazardous items. The shipper was also asked to properly stow and brace the cargo, and finally to properly document, mark, label and placard the container with the hazardous cargo. During the days that it took to coordinate this process, the USCG inspected and subsequently issued a notice of discrepancy.

The car was located on track 19 and was loaded with three intermodal tank containers, EXFU 143148, TRLU 027774 and EXFU 144208. The tank containers contained residue: last contained phosphorus, yellow, under water, class 4.1 (6.1), UN1381, PG I. Due to the smoke, visibility was impaired and it was believed that one or more of the tank containers was leaking with the phosphorus spontaneously igniting as it dried on the deck of the flatcar.  The flat car was isolated onto the rip track lead without incident and appropriate emergency notifications were completed.  Rail traffic was halted in the area, including the mainline. The mainline was shutdown approximately 2 hours.  Inspection was conducted by response personnel and determined that all of the tank containers were secure and had not been leaking. In addition, the smoke and flame was emitting from drying phosphorus that was on the deck of the flatcar. The source of the phosphorus was unknown, but it was speculated that it had been spillage from a previous loading event at Soda Springs, ID. It was believed that snow and ice might have kept the spillage from drying and igniting until in Avondale.  The spillage amount was estimated to be less than 2 ounces. A consensus was established that the spillage would be remediated and removed on site using an accelerated thermally enhanced combustion process.    The three loaded tank containers (EXFU 027998, EXFU 143230, TRLU 027729) containing phosphorus, yellow, under water that had been recently unloaded from flat car GIMX 10002 were inspected at the port of New Orleans, LA.  Inspections were also performed on approximately 30 other tank containers at the Port, and determined that none of them were leaking. However, tank container TRLU 027729 was observed with discoloration on the outer jacket, and is suspected as being the source of the phosphorus on flatcar GIMX 10002.",No additional comments.,No,TANK,Steel,51,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,5000,Union Pacific Railroad,US,

When the QC driver stopped at the main gate, the load sloshed forward and allowed a small amount of waste to leak from the manway washout nozzle into the crash box. The material drained down the drain tube and onto the pavement as he was pulling through the main gate, leaving approximately a 40 foot line of drips. Duration of material draining from drain tube was approximately 2 minutes. Site Security Services called the Tank Farm Advisor who contacted the tank farm operator. When the tank farm operator arrived at the truck, the Quality Carriers' driver had already opened, checked gasket and reclosed the manway with hammer. The driver did the same with the washout cap in the crashbox. (A washout cap seals a 3"" nozzle on the top centerline of a tank trailer. There are usually multiple nozzles along the top of a tank wagon that are used when the tank wagon needs to be cleaned.) The QC driver also cleaned the crashbox with a cleanup pad. The QC driver indicated that the washout cap had leaked. Once the spill had been cleaned up, the QC driver tested the load for leaks by pulling forward and backing up rapidly several times and there was no sign of leaks.The root cause of the leak was a dent in the end of the pipe (washout nozzle) where the cap gasket is supposed to seat.","Quality Carriers was notified of the damaged washout nozzle, and Tank Wagon #6634 was returned to their shop for repairs.Cherokee Pharmaceuticals will review its procedures with loading operators focusing on the need to test loaded containers for leaks prior to offering for transportation.",No,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CHEROKEE PHARMACEUTICALS LLC,US,

An unknown, notified 911 operator which triggered police and fire response. Fire was caused by leaking diesel fuel from the truck. Fire department from Forsyth GA extinguished the fire.  Carrier was notified of accident by the truck driver. Carrier then notified the shipper, Chemtrec, and NRC. Fire Department was unwilling to approach the tanker to report a leak or no leak condition. Carrier then contracted First Environmental Inc. to respond, investigate, and to conduct any clean-up of materials present.  Interstate 1-75 was dosed on the south bound lanes for a period of 10 hours during which time recovery of vehicles was performed, and a transload of the hazardous material to another specification cargo tank for transport was conducted. The initial cargo tank was not leaking, but was not road worthy following the rollover accident.  First Environmental cleaned up the area induding removal of top soils containing engine oil, anti-freeze, and diesel fuel.

LARRY J KING,REGULATORY MANAGER,25800 SCIENCE PARK DRIVE,CLEVELAND,OH,44122,Carrier,"The vehicle incurred a right side, steer tire failure.  The XATA crash data report indicates that the driver immediately removed his foot from the throttle and applied his brakes.  As the vehicle decelerated, the application of the brakes caused the vehicle to move to the right-side off the highway, crossing the paved shoulder on to the slope of a drainage ditch that tilted the vehicle beyond its center of gravity causing it to rollover coming to rest on the driver’s side.    Three (3) ammonium nitrate bin lids were torn off during the roll, even though they were securely locked.  The driver was seat belted properly during the crash, and subsequently was able to climb out of the passenger’s side of the vehicle.  9-1-1 was notified, and subsequently the driver’s terminal manager was notified of the incident.  The driver’s terminal manager notified the company, which notified ERTS, the company’s 24-hr spill consultant who dispatched Wench Associates, a qualified spill contractor to the scene.  ERTS called the National Response Center at 4:00 PM as required by the HMR.    The release occurred at 3:24 PM EST and the recovery was concluded at approximately 9:00 PM EST.  Wench Associates contained and cleaned up the spill working in coordination with State Highway officials and Local First Responders.","The company hired Valley Technical Services, a crash reconstruction investigation company (VTS), who within 48-hrs after the crash, investigated the crash scene and vehicle involved.  The failed steer tire was shipped from MN to OH for professional dismount by Goodyear Wingfoot for close examination to determine the root cause of the failure.      VTS’s investigation concluded that a sidewall bruise on the radial tire preconditioned the steer axle tire failure.  VTS also indicated that the driver’s actions, applying the brakes immediately after the failure, most likely caused the vehicle to move off the hard road surface into the drainage ditch.      The company will undertake the following actions to mitigate this type of incident:    1. Conduct Communications Meetings with drivers to review accident findings, conclusions and recommendations, and specific countermeasures to mitigate rollovers, and review importance of pre-trip and post-trip tire inspections.    2. Develop and implement certain policies and procedures regarding the use of its vehicles in off-road conditions or other locations where sidewall bruises could occur.      3. Review with the vehicle body manufacturer, countermeasures regarding protection of ammonium nitrate bin lids that would mitigate the probability of a spill.",Yes,CONTAINER,"Container, no description given (do not use if at all possible)",CONT,No,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,96100,,,

Instead the tanker had split in half and the hazardous material was released to the environment.  Approximately 4,300 gallons of the approximate 4,953 gallon load spilled onto the highway.  The driver was not injured and the tractor had no damage.  The leased comptank was towed back to Harold Marcus in Ontario, Canada, for inspection.    McCutcheon Enterprises, Inc. responded to the spill as did the Pennsylvania Dept. of Env. Protection (PADEP).  Soda ash was used to neutralize the corrosive material and approximately 7 yards of Residual waste was generated from the roadway cleanup and loaded into a roll-off container for future disposal.  Any puddles of liquid were neutralized onsite too.  Soil samples were taken and the area cleaned up had lower levels of RCRA metals than the background samples taken before and after the spill site.  A few wells were sampled in the area too and all results were fine so far.  Ongoing remediation and cleanup is being done by McCutcheon in conjuction with the PADEP Waste Management Section.    PENNDOT has requested samples of the highway so they may be tested by their laboratory for asphalt degradation.  This is also an ongoing project.",Eldredge is currently re-evaluating the use of comptanks for hauling this waste material.

The release was contained as the leaked product absorbed into the cardboard cartons.  The inner containers held the bulk of the product and the freight was kept right-side-up to prevent any additional release from the broken seals.",Liquid product subject to freezing should not have been transported during the cold weather period.  The origin Conway location of XAH was notified and advised of the spill.  They will follow up with the shipper to ensure future shipments are not made in non-climate controlled vehicles during freezing weather.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,,,,,,122,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,CON-WAY FREIGHT,US,

Witnesses confirmed that unit 2 did spin out of control in front of unit 1.  In any event, the Cargo tank was empty returning from a delivery.  During the jack-knife the saddle tank on the tractor punctured and leaked its approximate 50 gallons of diesel fuel onto the ground. The Cargo tank did not leak any HM.
