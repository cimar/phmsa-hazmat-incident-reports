(USES) RESPONDED AT THE REQUEST OF THE NEW ORLEANS PUBLIC BELT RAILROAD (NOPBRR), MR. JOE BERTUCCI, TO A TANK CAR LOCATED AT THEIR NEW ORLEANS, LA FACILITY, GIVING OFF AN ODOR. UPON ARRIVAL IT WAS NOTED THAT THE NEW ORLEANS FIRE DEPARTMENT HAZARDOUS MATERIALS  TEAM (NOFD)  AND HARBOR POLICE DEPARTMENT WERE ON SITE.  USES REPRESENTATIVE, MR FRANK PIEDISCALZO, MET WITH THE NOFD AND MR. BERTUCCI AND DISCUSSED THE SITUATION. MR. BERTUCCI INFORMED MR. PIEDISCALZO THAT THE ODOR WAS COMING FROM A GROUP OF CARS CONTAINING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND THEY WERE UNSURE AS TO WHICH ONE IT WAS MR. PIEDISCALZO AND A REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE RAILROAD WALKED DOWN THE TRACKS TO THE CARS IN QUESTION. ALONG THE PATH MR. PIEDISCALZO WAS CONDUCTING AIR MONITORING TO DETERMINE IF ANY LEL'S EXISTED BECAUSE 5 OF THE 6 CARS CONTAINED A FLAMMABLE MATERIAL. AS THEY APPROACHED THE CARS A SLIGHT PUNGENT ODOR WAS DETECTED BUT THE METER DETECTED NO READINGS. MR. PIEDISCALZO EXAMINED THE CARS ONE BY ONE AND NOTICED NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF A LEAK BUT DID NOTICE THAT THE ODOR WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE PRODUCTS CONTAINED IN 5 OF THE 6 TANK CARS. MR. PIEDISCALZO THEN DECIDED TO CHECK THE RAILCAR IN QUESTION (UTLX 28475). MR. PIEDISCALZO BROKE THE DOME SEAL AND HE NOTICED THE ODOR BECAME STRONGER WHEN THE LID WAS OPENED CONFIRMING THAT THE ODOR WAS COMING FROM THIS CAR. AFTER A VISUAL INSPECTION IT WAS DETERMINED AT THE POINT THAT THE ODOR MAY BE COMING FROM RESIDUAL PRODUCT  AROUND THE LIQUID LINE. MR. PIEDISCALZO CLOSED THE LID AND AT THE REQUEST OF THE RAILROAD REPRESENTATIVE AND THE APPROVAL OF THE NOFD THE CAR WOULD BE MOVED TO A SAFER LOCATION IN ORDER TO REOPEN THE RAIL YARD AND SECURE THE ODOR SOURCE. THE RAILCAR WAS MOVED TO A SECLUDED TRACK AWAY FROM ANY PEDESTRIAN AND COMMERCIAL TRAFFIC. THE NOFD AND THE HARBOR POLICE DEPARTED THE SCENE. MR. PIEDISCALZO THEN CLIMBED THE CAR WITH THE INTENTIONS OF CLEANING UP THE SPILLED PRODUCT AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE NO OTHER SOURCES FOR THE ODOR. MR. PIEDISCALZO INSTALLED A PRESSURE GAUGE ON THE CAR AS TO CHECK THE PRESSURE AND NOTICED IT WAS AT 45 PSI. HE THEN USED A SOLUTION TO CHECK FOR LEAKS AROUND ANY OF THE FITTINGS INSIDE OF THE PROTECTIVE HOUSING. AS HE APPLIED THE SOLUTION IT WAS QUICKLY NOTED THAT THE SAFETY RELIEF VALVE (SRV) WAS LEAKING. MR. PIEDISCALZO INFORMED THE NOPBRR REPRESENTATIVE THAT THE SRV'S CAP AND O-RINGS WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. MR. PIEDISCALZO THEN REMOVED THE CAP AND O-RINGS AND REPLACED THEM WITH NEW ONES. THE SRV WAS THEN RECHECKED FOR LEAKS. NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED. THE RESIDUAL PRODUCT WAS CLEANED UP AND THE CAR WAS RELEASED BY THE RAILROAD AT APPROXIMATELY 07:00 HOURS. MR.

BECAUSE THE INTENTION WAS TO LOAD 10,875 POUNDS OF TOLUENE INTO THE TANK TRUCK, AND THE REPORTABLE QUANTITY IS 1,000 POUNDS, IT IS CLASSIFIED AS A HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE. AN ESTIMATED 2,175 LBS HAD BEEN LOADED INTO THE TRUCK BEFORE THE PUMP WAS AUTOMATICALLY SHUT OFF. THE TANK TRUCK INTEGRITY WAS NOT COMPROMISED IN ANY WAY AND ALL OF THIS TOLUENE REMAINED IN THE TRUCK. TWO EMPLOYEES WERE BURNED, ONE FATALLY. HE SUCCUMBED TO THE BURNS ABOUT 12 HOURS AFTER THE FIRE. THE OTHER EMPLOYEE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS AND IS NOW AT HOME RECOVERING AND UNDERGOING FURTHER MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THERAPY. THE CITY OF BEDFORD PARK FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS A STATION RIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TERMINAL. IT IS ROUGHLY 600 YARDS FROM THE UNIVAR FACILITY. THE AUTOMATIC SYSTEMS AT THE UNIVAR FACILITY ALSO SOUNDED THE ALARM FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. THE UNIVAR FACILITY WAS IMMEDIATELY EVACUATED. I HEARD OF THE INCIDENT AT 9:00 AM. AT THAT TIME IT WAS THOUGHT THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAD CALLED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, AND THE ILLINOIS EPA. I TOOK OUT MY EMERGENCY RESPONSE NOTIFICATION FILE AND CALLED THE ILLINOIS EPA AT APPROX. 9:05 AM. THE PERSON I TALKED TO HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE FIRE EMERGENCY. I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE WHEN OR WHERE OR HOW THEY HAD RECEIVED THE INFORMATION. THE NUMBER I CALLED WAS (217 782-7860. AT APPROXIMATELY 9:10 AM I CALLED THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THEY DID NOT SHOW THAT ANYONE HAD CALLED THEM, FROM ILLINOIS. THEY TOOK THE AVAILABLE FIRE/RELEASE INFORMATION FROM ME AT THE TIME AND IT WAS LOGGED AS THEIR NUMBER 616192, BY AGENT BENNETT. ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE US EPA REGION 5 OFFICE. I BELIEVE THE PERSON'S NAME WAS THOMAS COOK.  I EXPLAINED THAT THE FIRE WAS OUT AND THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AGENCIES WERE ON SITE. ADDITIONALLY, I EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS CONTAINMENT AND THAT THERE WAS NO CONTINUING RELEASE, AND THAT THE ILLINOIS EPA HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE INCIDENT AND WAS PROBABLY IN CONTACT WITH THE LOCAL EMERGENCY  RESPONSE OFFICIALS(BEDFORD PARK FD).

UPON THAT THE DRIVER BRYANT SHELTON CALLED DAVE OUR DISPATCHER THIS WAS AT 2:00 PM.  DAVE GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THE BRYANT AND CALLED THE CONSIGNEE AND TALKED TO CHRISTINE PIZZULO PLANT MANAGER.  DAVE ASKED WHAT WAS LEAKING AND HOW BAD WAS THE LEAK.  SHE STATED THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW BAD THE LEAK WAS BUT IS DRIPPING OUT THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER AND SOME LIQUID WAS ON THE FLOOR.  AT THAT TIME DAVE CHECKED THE BILLS TO SEE WHAT WAS ON THE TRAILER AND FOUND OUT IS WAS CORROSIVE LIQUIDS.  HE AND CHRISTINE PIZZULO TALKED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS THE DRUMS LEAKING.  AT THAT TIME SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE DRUMS LEAKING.  DAVE INSTRUCTED HER TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND HE WOULD GET BACK WITH HER.  DAVE CALLED ME RIGHT AWAY AND I GAVE THE PHONE TO JOHN FERENCZI.  JOHN AND MYSELF WENT OUT TO THE SPILL SITE THIS WAS AT 2:30 PM.  WE ARRIVED AT THE SPILL SITE AT 4:15 PM.  MAHONING HAZARDOUS MATERIAL TEAM WAS ALREADY ON SITE ALONG WITH YOUNGSTOWN FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION OF OHIO.  WE TALKED TO THE YOUNGSTOWN FIRE DEPARTMENT CAPT RUSSO.  HE HAD THE MSDS PAPER WORK THAT WAS FAXED TO HIM.  CAPTAIN RUSSO TOLD ME THAT THE SCENE WAS CONTAINED.  WHICH THERE WAS NO LEAKING INTO THE WATER SYSTEM.  HE HAD OIL DRY AROUND THE SPILL.  I WENT LOOKING FOR THE CHIEF OF THE HAZ-MAT RESCUE TEAM.  I FOUND CHIEF CLYDE MACKENZIE AND HE TOLD ME AT THIS POINT WE CANNOT GET A HOLD OF THE CONSIGNEE TO SEE WHAT THEY USED THE MATERIAL FOR.  HE WAS ASKING THE CONSIGNEE TO SEE HOW HAZARDOUS THE LIQUID WAS AND WHAT PROTECTION THEY USE FOR THIS LIQUID.  THEN WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL A DECISION WAS MADE ABOUT THE LIQUID.  WHILE WE HAD TO WAIT, I GOT A STATEMENT FROM THE DRIVER BRYANT SHELTON.  (SEE ATTACHED STATEMENT, WHICH HE WROTE UP) I CONTACTED CHIEF MACKENZIE AGAIN AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY CHANCES SO THEY PUT ON THEIR SPACE SUITS THIS WAS AT ABOUT 5:15 PM.  THEY ENTERED THE DOCK AREA AND PROCEEDED TO ENTER THE TRAILER.  THEY PROCEEDED TO PUT THE LEAKING DRUM INTO A OVER PACK CONTAINER BUT THEY LEFT THE LID OFF BECAUSE OF THE VACUUM OF THE DRUM MADE IT TO TALL PER CHIEF MACKENZIE ALSO THEY SAW NO DAMAGE THAT COULD HAVE OCCURRED FROM MID-STATES EXPRESS. THEY WERE IN THE TRAILER ABOUT 30 MINS.  AT THAT POINT THE RAIN CAME DOWN SO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ADDED MORE OIL DRY BUT BECAUSE OF THE RAIN SOME OF THE CHEMICAL WENT DOWN THE DRAIN.  THEY THEN HAD TO FLUSH THE DRAIN.  IT TOOK 500 GALLONS OF WATER TO FLUSH THE DRAIN.  AT 6:00 PM.  I CALLED THE SUN PRO THE HAZ-MAT CLEAN UP COMPANY AND TALKED TO DUSTIN DULEBOHM.  I TOLD HIM OF THE SPILL AND FAXED HIM THE MSDS PAPERS.  AFTER HE GOT INFORMATION ON OUR COMPANY HE WOULD HAVE HIS TEAM ASSEMBLED AND BE OUT IN AN HOUR.

THE RELEASE OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 4:45 AM ON JULY 17,2002 WHEN A TANKER TRUCK PULLING A ""PUP"" TRAILER WENT OFF THE EAST SIDE OF HIGHWAY 72, CAUSING A RELEASE OF APPROXIMATELY 2,000 GALLONS OF CLEAR DIESEL FROM THE PUP TRAILER. SUBSEQUENT CLEANUP ACTIVITIES BY HINZE, INC. AND HANSER'S AUTOMOTIVE STAFF RECOVERED APPROXIMATELY 1,500 TO 1,700 GALLONS OF PRODUCT FROM THE PUP TRAILER AND IRRIGATION DITCH. THE RELEASED DIESEL IMMEDIATELY ENTERED A PRIVATE IRRIGATION DITCH LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE WEST SIDE OF HIGHWAY 72 (FIGURE 1). THIS IRRIGATION DITCH PROVIDES WATER TO THE GRASS HAYFIELDS OF THE GRAHAM PROPERTY, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 0.5 MILES NORTH OF THE RELEASE (FIGURE 1). ON THE DAY OF THE RELEASE, THIS IRRIGATION DITCH WAS ALIGNED SUCH THAT THE WATER WAS ROUTED TO THE NORTHERNMOST FIELD ON THE GRAHAM PROPERTY, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE NORTHEAST OF THE RELEASE POINT (FIGURE 1). MR ROGER WEBBER, THE FARMER WHO LEASES THE GRAHAM FIELDS, NOTICED THE RELEASE SHORTLY AFTER IT OCCURRED ON JULY 17,2002. IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE HAYFIELDS, MR. WEBBER PROMPTLY RE-ROUTED FLOW FROM THE NORTHERNMOST GRAHAM FIELD TO THE WASTEWATER RETURN CANAL LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 1,000 FEET SOUTH OF THIS FIELD (FIGURE 1). THIS PROMPT ACTION MINIMIZED ANY IMPACTS TO THE GRAHAM HAYFIELD. MR. WEBBER THEN MOVED TO THE START OF THE GRAHAM IRRIGATION CANAL, UPSTREAM OF THE RELEASE POINT, AND SHUT OFF THE WATER IN THIS DITCH. THIS PROMPT ACTION MINIMIZED IMPACTS ALONG THE IRRIGATION CANALS. AFTER MR. WEBBER ROUTED THE FLOW TO THE WASTEWATER RETURN CANAL, THE IMPACTED WATER TRAVELED APPROXIMATELY 1,300 FEET EAST ALONG THIS WASTEWATER IRRIGATION CANAL TO THE SAND CREEK CANAL (FIGURE 1). THE IMPACTED WATER THEN FLOWED NORTH IN THE SAND CREEK CANAL FOR A DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE MILES. ACCORDING TO MR. LUCK STUDER OF HANSER'S AUTOMOTIVE, IMPACTS WERE NOT OBSERVED IN THE SAND CREEK CANAL BELOW THE POINT WHERE THE CANAL CROSSED THE BORDER OF SECTIONS 16 AND 17, TOWNSHIP 6 SOUTH, RANGE 23 EAST (MR LUKE STUDER, PERSONAL COMMUNICATION, 2002; FIGURE 1).
