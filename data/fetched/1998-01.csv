HE SAID UPON ARRIVAL HE WAS SHOWN THE DRUMS AND ENDED UP REFUSING FOUR OF THE SEVEN DRUMS BEING OFFERED BECAUSE OF RESIDUE ON THE EXTERIORS.  THE DRUMS THAT WERE ACCEPTED WERE 55 GALLON PLASTIC, CONTAINING FLAMMABLE LIQUID.  OUR DRIVER WAS TOLD THAT THE DRUMS HAD BEEN SITTING IN STORAGE AT THE SHIPPERS FACILITY FOR SEVEN TO EIGHT YEARS LONG TIME.

HE STATED THAT WHEN HE OPENED THE DOORS TO GET HIS TWO WHEELER HE NOTICED BY THE WET FLOOR THAT A RUPTURE HAD TAKEN PLACE.  THE THREE DRUMS IN THIS SHIPMENT WERE LOADED  IN THE NOSE OF THE TRAILER WITH A TWO PILES OF EMPTY SKIDS IN BEHIND THEM.  THE ONLY FREIGHT BEHIND THE EMPTY SKIDS WAS 20 LOOSE CARTONS OF SHOES.  ONE OF THESE DRUMS RUPTURED ABOUT 4"" FROM THE BOTTOM.  THE CRACK WAS SHAPED LIKE A STAIR WAY.  WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE WHY THE DRUMS RUPTURED.  ALL DRUMS WERE FOUND TO BE UPRIGHT AND SECURED WHEN THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED.  THE PALLETS WERE ALSO ALL IN PLACE.  I CONTACTED CHEM-TREC TO OBTAIN AN MSDS BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO HELP.  CHEMTREC EVENTUALLY REACHED THE SHIPPER BY PHONE AND WE WERE THEN ABLE TO OBTAIN A DATA SHEET FROM THEM BY FAX.  OVER THE NEXT 90 MINUTES WE DETERMINED THAT INHALATION WOULD NOT BE HAZARDOUS AFTER VENTING THE TRAILER. EMERGENCY SPILL KITS AT THE TRAILER INTERCHANGE POINT WERE USED TO ABSORB THE SPILLED MATERIAL.  BECAUSE OF THE FLUID LIKE MAKE UP OF THIS MATERIAL IT WAS MOSTLY ABSORBED IN TO THE WOODEN TRAILER FLOOR.  VIRTUALLY NO MATERIAL HIT GROUND SURFACE.

ONE OF THE VALVES CONNECTING THE STYRENE STORAGE TANK TO THE MONOMER MIX TANK IN R-11 WAS NOT CLOSED AFTER THE STYRENE CHARGE. AT APPROXIMATELY 23:15, R-11 PERSONNEL, FROM A NEW SHIFT, PREPARED ANOTHER MONOMER MIX WHICH REQUIRED A SPECIAL SUPPLY OF STYRENE. THE REQUIRED STYRENE WAS TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY FROM THE SUPPLIER'S TANK WAGON INTO THE MONOMER MIX TANK IN R-11 USING THE STYRENE STORAGE TANK PUMP. DUE TO AN EMERGENCY IN THE PLANT, THE R-11 WORKER MAKING THE TRANSFER FROM THE TANK WAGON TO THE R-11 MONOMER MIX TANK WAS CALLED AWAY. THE DEPARTING WORKER NOTIFIED THE R-11 CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR THAT HE NEEDED TO LEAVE TO ATTEND TO THE EMERGENCY. AT APPROXIMATELY 00:10 (JANUARY 21, 1997), ANOTHER R-11 OPERATOR WENT OUTSIDE OF R-11 TO STOP THE TRANSFER FROM THE STYRENE TANK WAGON. THE OPERATOR OBSERVED A SMALL AMOUNT OF STYRENE COMING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE TANK WAGON, INFORMED THE R-11 SHIFT FOREMAN AND CLEANED UP THE STYRENE THAT WAS UNDER THE TANK WAGON (5 TO 10 GALLONS WAS THE ESTIMATE). THE OPERATOR AND THE SHIFT FOREMAN DID NOT OBSERVE STYRENE ENTERING THE CHEMICAL SEWER. AT APPROXIMATELY 07:45, THE PHILADELPHIA WATER DEPARTMENT (PWD) ARRIVED AT THE PLANT BECAUSE OF HIGH STYRENE READINGS AT THE POTW. THE PWD REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLED THE NEUTRALIZATION MIX TANK AND FOUND AN 8 INCH LAYER OF STYRENE. AT THIS POIN THE PWD REPRESENTATIVE CONTACTED THE PLANT ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER AND REQUESTED THE DISCHARGE BE SHUT OFF AND THE STYRENE PUMPED OUT OF THE NEUTRALIZATION MIX TANK. BY APPROXIMATELY 08:00, THE PLANT SHUT DOWN ALL PROCESSES TO MINIMIZE FLOW TO THE SEWER. THE PLANT ALSO STARTED TO REMOVE STYRENE FROM THE TOP OF THE NEUTRALIZATION MIX TANK INTO DRUMS. THE PLANT CONTINUED TO REMOVE STYRENE, WORKING THROUGHOUT THE DAY WITH PWD TO RESUSCITATE A LINE RUSH TO REMOVE ALL STYRENE IN THE SEWER LINES AND NEUTRALIZATION MIX TANK, WITH THE STYRENE LAYER BEING REMOVED TO DRUMS. AT APPROXIMATELY 21:00, THE PLANT CONTACTED THE PWD TO INFORM THEM THE STYRENE REMOVAL WAS COMPLETE. THE PWD RETURNED TO THE PLANT, INSPECTED THE NEUTRALIZATION MIX TANK, AND ALLOWED RESUMPTION OF NORMAL OPERATIONS IN THE PLANT. THE INCIDENT REVIEW INDICATED THAT THE PHYSICAL CAUSE WAS IMPROPER VALVE ALIGNMENT. ONE OF THE STYRENE STORAGE TANK VALVES WAS NOT CLOSED AFTER FINISHING THE PREPARATION OF THE MONOMER MIX ON JANUARY 20, 1997. SUBSEQUENTLY, A STYRENE TANK WAGON WAS CONNECTED TO THE STYRENE STORAGE TANK INTO THE STYRENE TANK WAGON. STYRENE FROM THE STORAGE TANK FLOWED INTO THE STYRENE TANK WAGON WHICH OVERFLOWED AND WAS RELEASED INTO THE CHEMICAL SEWER SYSTEM. THERE WERE INADEQUATE TURNOVER MEASURES TAKEN WHEN THE R-11 PERSONNEL MAKING THE STYRENE TANK WAGON TRANSFER WAS CALLED TO AN EMERGENCY.

COOPER, MANAGER, CHEMICAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, WAS CONTACTED BY THE ICTF SECURITY FORCES, REPORTING A LEAKING CONTAINER. MANAGER COOPER DROVE TO THE ICTF TERMINAL AND LOCATED THE ABOVE 20 FOOT CONTAINER IN SECTION E805, STALL#284. A SMALL POOL OF LIQUID (LESS THAN 1 GALLON) WAS OBSERVED ON THE PAVEMENT BETWEEN THE REAR AXLES OF THE CHASSIS WHERE THE PRODUCT HAD DRIPPED THROUGH THE FLOORING OF THE CONTAINER. THE CONTAINER WAS DIAPERED AND MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK  FOR INSPECTION. THE LIQUID WAS ABSORBED FROM THE PAVEMENT AND THE WASTE MOVED TO THE CUSTOMS DOCK FOR TEMPORARY RETENTION. UPON REMOVING SEAL MONSANTO ANNISTON 980, AND OPENING THE REAR DOORS,OBSERVED THE CONTENTS TO BE 55 GALLON DRUMS, LOADED 4 EACH TO PALLETS, AND DOUBLE STACKED THROUGHOUT THE CONTAINER. THE DRUMS WERE NOT SECURED TO EACH OTHER OR TO THE PALLETS, AND THERE WAS NO VISIBLE BILEVEL SEPARATION BETWEEN THE PALLETS FROM THE UPPER TIER TO PREVENT CONTACT WITH THE DRUM HEADS OF THE FLOOR TIER. THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDED PROTOCOL FOR THE LOADING OF DRUMS AND IS NOT AN APPROVED METHOD PER THE AAR BOE 6C FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS VIA THE RAIL. THE RESTRAINT SYSTEM CONSISTED OF TY PATCH MATERIAL, WITH DOUBLE STRIPS COVERING EACH TIER AT THE REAR OF THE LADING. IT WAS OBVIOUS THE ENTIRE LOAD HAD SHIFTED AGAINST THE REAR DOORS OF THE CONTAINER, WHICH WAS PREDICATED BY THE MISAPPLICATION OF THE TY PATCH. AS THE LADING CONSISTED OF 80 DRUMS, THE ROWS OF DRUMS CONSISTED OF A 4,4,4 PATTERN, FRONT TO REAR. BASED UPON THE MANUFACTURERS RECOMMENDATIONS, UTILIZING THE TY PATCH SYSTEM REQUIRES DOUBLE BAYING OF THE DRUMS IN EACH TIER IN ORDER TO NOT EXCEED THE TEST STRENGTH OF THE MATERIAL. THIS ALSO REQUIRES THE FINAL ROW OF DRUMS IN EACH BAY TO END WITH A 3 PATTERN IN ORDER FOR THE DRUMS TO PROPERLY NEST AND ALLOW FOR THE SECUREMENT OF THE TY PATCH, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DRUMS TO 76 FOR A PROPER LOADING. UPON REMOVING THE TY PATCH MATERIAL, OBSERVED ONE DRUM, SECOND OUT FROM THE RIGHT SIDE, TOP TIER, THAT WAS SO FATIGUED FROM ABRADING THE REAR DOORS, THAT THE SIDEWALL SEEM OF THE DRUM WAS SMOOTH, AND DEEMED UNFIT FOR FURTHER MOVEMENT. THE DRUM DIRECTLY BELOW ON THE FLOOR TIER, WAS SLAO DAMAGED IN THE SAME MANNER, HOWEVER THE DAMAGED WAS CAUSED BY AN ADJACENT DRUM MOVING AND OVERLAPPING THE BOTTOM CHIME, ALLOWING CHIME CONTACT WITH THE SEAM THAT EVENTUALLY ABRADED THE SEEM TO THE POINT OF FAILURE. THE DRUM WAS REMOVED, PATCHED, AND PLACED INTO A OVERPACK FOR SECUREMENT. BASED UPON THE WEIGHT OF THE DRUM AND THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT ON THE FLOOR OF THE CONTAINER, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 2-3 GALLONS WAS RELEASED. UPON INSPECTING THE REMAINING DRUMS, 6 MORE FROM FLOOR TIER HAD SUSTAINED SUFFICIENT DAMAGE TO ALSO DEEM THEM UNFIT FOR FURTHER MOVEMENT. ALL WERE PLACED INTO OVER PACKS FOR SECUREMENT.
