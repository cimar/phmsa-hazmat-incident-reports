While doing the transfer the employee transferring the drum accidently punctured the side of a 55 gallon steel drum with the lower forks of his hand truck. The employee turned the drum upside down and stopped the leak and then put down absorbant pads and spill booms inside trailer. Employee contacted his supervisor and a crew over packed the drum and put all spill debris and PPE into an over pack for continued transportation to the drums intended disposal facility. The Maryland MDE was notified and chose not to respond Report # 1600-01162015,"The drum was damaged due to the drum dolly puncturing the drum. Another root cause was the fact that the dock plate was uneven with the dock causing the drum dolly to tilt and lose the drum. In order to prevent a recurrence, the employee was spoken with and is being retrained regarding the importance of safe transfer operations and preventing these type of incidences from reoccuring.

Both issues were identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper Tom Davidson (404)652-4052) of Leaf River Corp's parent company Georgia Pacific. The manway securement bolts that were less than tool tight were secured properly and the shipper confirmed that the car had a mixture of turpentine solutions mixed with a flammable liquid, the shipper confirmed that the 1993 placards on the car were correct, and the shipper confirmed that the initial waybill information was incorrect.  The waybill was corrected by the shipper. The car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move.

No leaks were observed.  KCS dispatched a hazmat responder. Upon arrival the responder determined that  GATX 95232 was not leaking and was secure in all aspects.    To identify the source of the odor, the responder walked the tracks with air monitoring equipment.  In doing so, the responder detected the odor coming from UTLX 640712 - no readings were detected by the equipment.  A full assessment of the tank car showed no closure issues on top of the car; however, the bottom outlet valve (BOV) was found to be iced over due to the commodity being loaded at below freezing temperatures.  No leaks were observed and no measureable meter readings were detected.  The shipper came to the Yard to investigate.  It was assumed that spillage which occurred while loading the car was the source of odor and that the odor would clear once the sun came out and the weather warmed.  Based on this, KCS agreed to return the car for shipping as normal.    The following day, another report of the odor was made in regards to the same tank car (UTLX 640712), but this time the car was observed to be leaking.  The responder returned to the Yard and discovered that the ice that was on the tank car had started to melt giving the appearance of a leak.  The drips were collected in a bucket and were verified to be without odor.  It was determined by KCS and the responder that the BOV needed to be deiced in order to make a better assessment.  Upon completion of the deicing, the entire area surrounding the BOV was dried.  Immediately, a drip coming from the BOV flange bolts was observed.  The drips were collected in a bucket and verified to be Methyl Methacrylate.  All flange bolts were determined to be tight.    Arrangements were made for an imminent field transfer of the tank car to tank trucks.  These transfers occurred on January 17, 2015.  The responder opened the manway lid to verify that the tank car was completely empty.  Upon inspecting the inside of the tank car, the BOV flange gasket was observed not to be centered, possibly causing the leak.  The tank car valves were tagged per FRA OTMA guidelines + ""Leaky Tank Car - Do Not Load"" was painted on both sides of the car.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated.

The car was isolated and the shipper, Valero Marketing + Supply Company was notified via CHEMTREC, report 2015-01-27-00104. A CSX Emergency Response contractor, Summit, the Indianapolis, IN branch office was dispatched to the scene. Upon inspection it was determined that the 2"" vapor valve threads (at base of valve) and 2"" pipe nipple threads had been cross threaded and damaged which resulted in the car leaking vapors. Summit removed the 2"" vapor valve and pipe nipple, installed the 2"" plug and tightened tool tight , CSX crew shook car and Summit inspected for securement and leaks with no further leaks were found. Eagle Railcar was then contracted to replace the vapor valve and to bubble test the car. This was conducted on 1/29/2015.    A HAZMATHOLD was placed on NATX 364173.

The tractor/trailer, cargo tank went off the roadway to the left landing in a creek bed between the east and west bound lanes of I-24. In the roll over, the front clean out nozzle was pushed back causing a breach in the tank.  This was “Extreme dynamic loads in excess of those suggested in 49 CFR 178.345-3 resulted in a moment about the subject nozzle, causing the pipe to tear from the thin-walled pressure vessel.” This resulted in the release of approximately 3,500 gallons of resin solution into the creek over a period of several hours.     Local emergency responders were not able to stop the leak but were able to place absorbent boom downstream to contain the material. The material was loaded at 150°F. As the material released into the cold creek water, it immediately cooled and began to cling together staying in an area within 100 yards of the cargo tank. Environmental remediation crews were brought in the day of the event and for a total of  6 days, those crews worked to contain and remove the released material from the creek. Absorbent boom and catch fences were left in place until the first rain after the product release. Several days after the rain they were checked. There was no material found in the booms or catch fences so they were removed from the creek.",,Yes,TANK,Cargo tanks,MC307,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,361145,"Miller Transporters, Inc.",US,

This train was re-inspected upon arrival at the BNSF's Auburn railyard. Inspection results identified an additional six entrained tank cars with commodity on their top side shells and these tank cars were set-out of the train for further inspection and cleaning.  These six tank cars were all DOT 111S100W1's, built in 2012 and the spill on their side shells estimated at 1 gallon or less per tank car with the exception of UTLX 212850 estimated at approximately 5 gallons. All six tank cars were identified as leaking at their liquid valves that had loose closure plugs with the liquid valves in the closed position. The liquid valves (3 inch McKenzie ball valves) were not seating/sealing properly in the closed position. Responders relieved internal pressure within these tank cars and reseated the liquid valves. The less than tool tight closure plugs were removed, Teflon tape sealant applied to their threaded areas, the exposed valve ports were cleaned, the closure plugs reapplied and properly tool tightened. Residual spillage on the tank car shells were cleaned. All securement and cleaning was accomplished on 1/14/2015. No further leakage from the liquid valves were observed afterwards.

The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the shipper, DOW Chemical Company Christopher Harvey, phone number 979-238-3130.  Contractor personnel tightened the packing gland nut and placed absorbent material around the nut and returned on 02/05/2015 to transfer the contents of the tank car.  Once the transfer was complete the car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move. A is 7.1 required.

BNSF mechanical responders placed absorbent padding and a catch basin under BNSF 880632's BOV to catch the commodity drips. The bottom operated BOV was inspected. The BOV was closed, its closure plug was secure along with its mounting flange bolt nuts. A compromised BOV mounting flange gasket was suspected as being the cause of the commodity release.  BNSF 880632 was fully unloaded by 1600 hrs. MST 1/16/2015 which ended any further commodity drips from the BOV. The amount of diesel fuel unloaded was compared to the gallons billed from the originating loading facility to determine a variance or an estimate of possible commodity loss.  A remediation contractor excavated impacted ballast and soils at the observed ground spillage areas followed by a treatment of Micro-Blaze to those areas.

Contract responders were called to inspect ACFX 79474. On 1/21/2015, responders reported that ACFX 79474's BOV was in the closed position, but its closure plug was not tool tight which allowed commodity to drip from the closure plug's threaded connection.

As a result of the accident, the driver was injured, the roadway closed, and a spill of 3,000 pounds of the cargo.   The weather conditions were cold and rainy, and there was ice present on the road, which is a 2 lane asphalt county road in Northern Kentucky. The speed limit on the road is 55, except in curves where suggested speeds range between 25 and 35.  The driver was traveling at an average speed of around 24 MPH in the minutes prior to the accident. The driver had made this trip on previous occasions, but on this trip he was concerned with the road’s surface conditions as he descended a 3% grade, and made a precautionary decision to reduce his speed.  At the time of the accident, The Vehicle’s PeopleNet system indicated his speed at 24 mph.   In the accident area, the roadway entered an area shaded from the sun, the roadway’s superelevation titled to the downhill lane, and there was a curve with a drainage ditch. These conditions and the driver’s attempt to slow The Vehicle further by “tapping the brakes”, led to the vehicle sliding off the roadway into the ditch on its passenger side. The spill was caused when some of the manholes on the top of the dry bulk trailer were torn off.  First responders extricated the driver from the truck, and transported him to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.  the spill was cleaned up by a qualified third party, hired by the company's spill emergency response firm.  The cargo was transloaded into another vehicle.","The driver, who had over 10 years of experience in driving combination vehicles, and was Smith System trained, was re-trained in the 5 keys of the Smith System, with emphasis on vehicular control and weather conditions.  He will also have adequate time to recover from the accident prior to his return to driving.

As documented in the police report, ice and snow covered roads caused the tanker to slide off the roadway and become disconnected from the truck.  The tanker rolled and was positioned within an unnamed tributary of Anthony Creek of the Greenbrier River.  Greenbrier County Homeland Security and Emergency Services, two local fire departments, an environmental contractor responded to the incident to assist with containing the approximately 3,975 gallons of diesel that had spilled.    The diesel fuel spilled from the drop tubes, which were damaged in the accident.  The duration of the release was approximately six hours.  The release was stopped when Woodford Transport was able to pump the remaining diesel fuel into another tanker and the tanker was removed from the unnamed tributary.  The leak was reported to the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (WVDEP) and the National Response Center.       Steps were immediately taken to contain the diesel at the accident site; however an unknown quantity entered Anthony Creek.  Woodford retained the services of two additional spill response contractors to assist.  The WVDEP requested assistance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA).  The USEPA and US Coast Guard assisted with placement of river and absorbent boom within Anthony Creek and the Greenbrier River.  As a precautionary measure, two public water intakes located on the Greenbrier River were closed and eventually reopened following water testing indicated no diesel was present.  Remediation at the accident site is nearly complete as of 2/19/2015.  As a precautionary measure, boom is being maintained within the unnamed tributary, Anthony Creek, and Greenbrier River.

The Environmental + Hazmat Department mobilized a response contractor to the yard to assess and conduct air monitoring.    The source of the odor was identified from tank car GATX 44890.  The odor was determined to be coming from the top fitting protective housing.      Upon opening the protective housing, the responder clearly saw free liquid around the base of the vacuum relief valve.  The air valve plug was removed and the valve opened to verify 0 pressure on the tank car.  Upon removal of the protective cap on the relief valve, the internal spring mechanism was seen to be misaligned and not seating correctly.  This misalignment was due to trash present on the sealing surface.    The shipper came to the yard and a new vacuum relief valve was installed.  The car was returned to home-shop under a FRA OTMA where leak / pressure testing occurred and the tank car recertified.    File Note: Item 19-the quantity released was estimated. The actual amount released from this container is unknown to the carrier. To determine actual amount released: contact the offeror to determine actual quantity in tank car at origin (if available), then contact consignee to determine actual amount in tank car once unloaded (if available), and the difference will be the total amount released.     File Note: Item 27-Amount in package was estimated by this report preparer because the exact information is not available to carrier. Shipper provided bulk quantity on shipping paper as 1 Tank Car, per DOT requirements.","The Kansas City Southern Railway (KCSR) notified shipper of this release. Non Accidental Releases (NAR) can be devastating on several different levels. They can cause personal injury, environmental damage, disrupt rail yards, adjacent facilities and communities, and snarl train operations for hundreds of miles and both directions. NARs are troublesome to all because they are, by and large, preventable. For non accident releases (a.k.a. package closure issues such as this), the shipper is requested to conduct a root-cause investigation to determine the cause(s) of release and to then facilitate corrective action to prevent recurrence. It is requested that the shipper share their findings with KCS.     (Please direct your root cause investigation results and corrective actions to Steve McNealy, KCS Railway, P.O.

Initial Notification:  Susan Tyler, the Environmental Compliance Manager with Sun Coast Resources, reported the spill on January 11, 2015, to 1-800-832-8224. Incident# 20150153 was assigned the spill.    Status of Spill:  Spill response actions are complete. Detailed description is listed below.     Response Chronology:  On January 10, 2015, Sun Coast Resources driver Robert Carmickle rolled over SCRI Unit No. 70034/1608 as a result of vehicular accident. During transfer of the crude oil from the trailer it was noted that ventilation system was damaged during the accident and approximately 420 gallons of crude spilled into an adjacent waterway off Highway 181 just outside of Falls City, Texas. The spill was discovered at 1:30 AM on 1/11/2015 and was immediately reported to our internal spill response team.     The SCRI spill response team consisting of Jake Pena, Mark Doise, Susan Tyler and Stratton Williams and spill contractor Clean Tank Inc. (CTI), arrived on site on 1/11/2015.    Meteorology:  Weather conditions during the spill response were cold and rainy and did increase the spread of the spill in the waterway until containment booms were utilized.     Reported Injuries:  There were no injuries or fatalities associated with this spill.    Remediation of Contamination:  The spilled crude oil was removed from the water body by utilizing a skimmer and booms. Approximately 400 gallons of oily water was removed and           transported via a vacuum truck to be temporarily stored at the SCRI San Antonio facility prior to shipment to the SCRI Houston facility for aggregation and disposal at a licensed vendor.    Sampling and Analysis:  No soil sampling or laboratory analysis was conducted since the spill occurred over water.     Waste Classification and Disposal:  The oily water mixture was disposed at Intergulf, located at 10020 Bayport Blvd, Pasadena, TX 77507, phone number (281) 474-4210. The used absorbent material was recycled at Nickco Recycling, located at 3363 FM 3042, Pittsburg, TX 75686, Phone number (903) 856-3522.    Additional Corrective Actions:  No corrective actions were taken as the spill was a result of a vehicular accident in which the SCRI driver was found not to be at fault.    If you have questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at (713) 844-9600, ext. 1138.

Bradley Road,Milwaukee,WI,53223,Carrier,"Hydrite blends and hauls products for Washing Systems to customers of Washing Systems.   A representative from Washing Systems typically meets the Hydrite drivers at Washing System customer facilities.      Hydrite’s driver, Rob Sauer, arrived at Cintas in Rockford, IL at 7:50 a.m. on 1/13/15 with Tanker LT1796 to deliver Advance, Structure, and Express from a 3 compartment trailer.  Mike Litrell of Washing Systems met Rob Sauer at the Cintas plant, and they discussed the product delivery amounts.   Mike told Rob that they could not off-load all of the Structure because there would not be enough room in the tank.   Mike also told Rob that the Express would go into 2 tanks and that they would start with Advance, then Structure, and end with Express.   By delivering in this order, which is non-hazardous to caustic, the same transfer hose could be used.    Rob unloaded the Advance first.  The air from blowing out the line was released through the receiving tank.    Rob then transferred all of the Structure except for approximately 100 gallons.  At that point, Rob shut the valve at the tanker and the storage tank.  Rob “walked the hose back” to the bleeder valve (Chicago fitting at the tanker discharge), which was set up to deposit residual material into a bucket.  Mike from Washing Systems disposed of this material in Cintas’ drain.    Lastly, Rob (wearing full PPE – suit, gloves, boots, goggles, and face shield) connected the hose to the Express compartment and on the other end connected to the smaller Express tank.  Rob transferred 550 gallons of Express to the small Express tank and closed the inlet valve to the small Express storage tank.   Rob then went to the tanker and shut the discharge valve at the tanker.     Rob and Mike discussed how to bleed off the pressure in the line.   Rob decided to run the excess into the storage tank.   Rob connected the air to the bleeder connection at the tanker discharge and opened the bleeder valve to blow out the line.   Rob walked back inside the Cintas plant.  Mike was located at the inlet valve to the small Express storage tank, and Mike told Rob that he had already opened and closed the inlet.  Mike told Rob that the line was empty and to switch the line to the other tank.     As a result, Rob went outside to move the air line from the bleeder to the tanker compartment.    Rob went inside to move the hose to the 2nd Express tank.   When Rob loosened  the second ear, the hose still had enough pressure that it blew off the connection and blew mist of the Express product to where Mike and Keith (Cintas) were standing – about 40 feet away.   Evidence of the material on the floor could be seen up to 50 feet away.   Mike and Keith were both exposed to this material but were not wearing full body PPE.  (Per Mike, Cintas does not require full body PPE if an employee is standing 20 feet away from the transfer site).   Mike was wearing safety glasses.    Mike and Rob helped Keith to a safety shower where Mike and","The root cause of the incident was failure to adequately bleed the line (failure to follow our standard operating procedure TR013AF).   Although the driver has been trained on these procedures, and has successfully done this for years, this failure resulted in an injury.   That driver has been disciplined.    All drivers at the MK facility have been retrained on the need to bleed pressure.   The line could have been bled by disconnecting the air to the bleeder, and then using the bleeder valve to bleed the excess pressure.  Drivers who are actively unloading must physically verify that the line has been bled before it is disconnected.        In addition, the Cintas employee did not use an eyewash, and instead used Coca Cola, which is acidic.   Drivers were reminded that if they are involved in a bulk transfer, they must locate the nearest eyewash and safety shower in addition to wearing the required personal protective equipment.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 407,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Hydrite Chemical Co.,US,
