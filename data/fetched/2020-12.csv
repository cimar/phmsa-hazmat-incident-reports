The car was isolated and National Response Center, Ohio EPA, and Federal Railroad Administration were notified. The emergency response telephone number on the waybill was contacted,  (CHEMTREC Report #2020-1215-00163), and as of this report no successful notification to the shipper of record has been made despite multiple attempts. Joseph Taylor, a CSXT Senior Manager of Hazardous Materials was dispatched to the scene and found the vapor line valve 1/8 turn in the open position and the vapor valve secondary closure plug was not installed resulting in a vapor release of lading. The issue was identified and corrective actions were communicated to the FRA, as the shipper has been unreachable. Mr. Taylor closed the valve, installed the secondary closure plug, thus securing the release. The car was released for transport. This incident did not require a special switching move. 7.1 is not required?

He told our driver there was enough capacity as it was a 5000 gallon tank.  Our driver didn't validate how much was in it or what the bill of lading showed 5100 gallons and our work assignment showed 4731 gallons.  He felt he should trust the owner.  He could readily tell us what the Schneider process is which is to go by capacity minus 10% for the stopping point.  Before the first spill happened he realized it wasn't going to all fit and he walked to tell the customer that which was over 100 feet away and up on a ledge inside a building.  The owner said they were currently at 4500 gallons and to go shut down.  Before the driver could get back to the truck product started overflowing.  He knew the process is we shut down product flow when leaving the controls but did not do that here.  We also learned he was utilizing 25psi and again commented that he knew Schneider policy is 15psi or less except with approval for special situations.  Approximately 5 gallons spill initially.  They then went to a second storage tank where the customer advised it would hold the rest.  He told the driver to drape the hose over in to the tank.  Nothing was securing the hose.  This is another violation of Schneider policy.  We must always have a secure connection.  The driver stilll had 25psi on the trailer and opened the valve.  The resulting force caused the hose to come out of the customer tank spilling an estimated 25 gallons extra.  It was contained inside of their building, same place where the other spill occurred.","There were many things that went wrong on this delivery.   • Capacity validation • Too much air pressure  • Valves fully open at the end of filling • Walking away with product flowing • Unsecure connection The fact that our driver could recite most of the processes he should have been following but chose not to is decidedly a behavioral issue.  In our experience that is hard to correct or change in someone so we severed employment ties with this individual.  We have also provided feedback to the customer that we should always validate starting amounts in tanks, as well as what is being delivered, and always using secure connections.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,"SCHNEIDER NATIONAL BULK CARRIERS, INC.",US,

Driver was initiating a left hand turn at an intersection to get on the entrance ramp to the interstate. While negotiating the turn the liquid movement inside the tanker moved to the right and caused the truck and tanker to roll over onto its right side. There was more liquid movement due to the 7000 gallon tanker being loaded with approximately 3500 gallons. No other vehicles were involved in the accident. After the rollover occurred it was discovered that there was a small leak from one of the wash out caps on top of the tanker. The police department and fire department responded to the scene. The fire department contained the spill. An emergency response crew was also engaged to respond to the scene for clean up and remediation.

Reportedly, there was hissing escaping from around the manway and the smell of  Acetone atop the tank car. The tank car was isolated from Yard employees. The shipper, Chemisphere, Corporation  was notified via Chemtrec, report #2020-12-07-00091. Marion Environmental Inc. a Conrail emergency response  contractor, was dispatched to the Pavonia Terminal as well as Joseph Caccamo, Manager of Hazardous Material for  Conrail. It was found that the manway was releasing a slight amount of vapor from around the seal. All manway  securement bolts were found tight however after inspection of the manway ring gasket it was determined that the  gasket was in poor condition with an area crushed and heavily grooved beyond specification. A new nozzle gasket  was installed on the manway and it was secured properly. The tank car was then released for disposition.

Upon inspection it was determined that there was a small crack in the drum on the bottom of the container. The drum was overpacked into a 85 gallon steel drum to continue transportation to the treatment storage and disposal facility.    The drum leaked less than 1 pint of mixed solvents while in transit due to the crack. The liquid was cleaned up with spill pads and absorbent and the drum was over-packed into an appropriate salvage drum. The duration of release is anticipated to be a small drip from the drum for about 24 hours.","On 12/8/2020 the Veolia safety manager of Schenectady, NY was notified. The results of the investigation is that a drum either had a small hole or crack in it from the manufacturer or the crack or hole was caused when moving the drum with a drum cart. It is hard to determine the exact cause of spill as it was a very small hole/crack and was only slightly dripping when discovered.  Veolia employees must continue to inspect drums when handling prior to and during transportation and notify management upon discovery of a leaking container.

The employee removed the hose from the valve assembly on the rail tanker and placed it over the railing, but did not tie the hose off to the railing of the tanker prior to moving on to the next step in the task. The hose slipped from the railing and fell to the ground, spilling approximately 24 gallons of material to the ground in the RTF East Building.    The duration of the spill, from the time it occurred until cleanup was completed, was approximately 15 minutes. The spilled material was immediately diked up to keep it from spreading and was then absorbed with floor dry.",USEI has reviewed the work standard and found that it is inadequate.

The rear tandem axles of the cargo trailer left the roadway into the highway median.  This caused the tractor trailer driver to lose control. The vehicle entered the highway median and overturned just East of the intersection of US Highway 64 and Bob Horton Road. The body of the tanker was damaged resulting in the release of approximately 700 gallons of aviation gasoline, with the release occurring over an estimated three hour period. The damage to the tanker body consisted of a three foot long crack near the bottom center of the tanker.

Due to the nature of propane, the heat from the diesel tank fire served to raise the level of PSI within many of the 20# cylinders and their relief valves opened, venting propane which ignited and sent a number of cylinders flying in many directions. The relief valves did NOT fail- they operated as prescribed. By the time the fire department arrived and subdued the fire, most of the cylinders remained intact as their surface area was cooled by the air temperature and water. The release lasted about 45 minutes until the fire department get the situation under control. The fire was intense althe beginning of the event and was extinguished by the NYCFD.","Clearly this was a direct result of the improper actions of the other driver that occured when the two lanes narrowed into one; the other driver then raced in front of our truck, causing our driver to swerve to aviod a serious collision.
