TOXIC ORGANIC SOLIDS UN#2811, ORGANOPHOSPHORUS PESTICIDES TOXIC LIQUID UN#3018, AND TOLUENE METHANOL FLAMMABLE LIQUID UN#1993.  A SITE SAFETY MEETING WAS HELD AND A PLAN OF ACTION WAS DISCUSSED.  THEN ENTRY WAS MADE INTO THE TRAILER TO FIND CAUSE OF LEAK.  ONE TEAM OF TECHS WAS TO MAKE ENTRY INTO TRAILER WITH A BACK UP TEAM ON READY STATUS ON SITE WITH PROPER DECON IN PLACE.  SCBA AND SARNEX SUITES WERE REQUIRED DUE TO CONFINED SPACE OF CHEMICALS.  THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED TO BE A DRUM OF TOLUENE LOCATED IN THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER.  THE DRUM HAD A PIN HOLE LEAK ABOUT ONE FOOT FROM THE TOP.  A TEMPORARY PATCH WAS PLACED ON THE DRUM.  HWY 59 THEN PROCEEDED WITH REMOVAL OF THE LIQUIDS FROM THE DRUM WITH OUR VACUUM TRAILER.  HWY 59 ALSO PLACED ABSORBENTS IN THE FLOOR OF THE TRAILER ON THE CONTAMINATED AREA TO CONTAIN THE LIQUIDS.  AFTER CONTAINMENT OF THE LIQUIDS WAS COMPLETED HWY 59 REMOVED THE BULK OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL ON THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD AND PLACED THEM IN A 55 GALLON DRUM.  THE TRUCK AND TRAILER WAS ESCORTED TO OUR MARSHALL TX. YARD.  AT THE YARD HWY 59 REMOVED THE EMPTY DRUM OF TOLUENE AND PLACED IT IN A POLY DRUM OVER PACK.  THE OVER PACK WAS PLACED BACK ON TRIAD'S TRAILER.  HWY 59 THEN COMPLETED THE EXTERNAL CLEAN UP OF THE CONTAMINANTS FROM THE OUTSIDE RIGHT FRONT CORNER OF THE TRAILER.  A CALL WAS PLACED TO CHRIS WITH TRIAD TO UPDATE TRIAD. THEN THE TRUCK AND TRAILER WAS RELEASED TO CONTINUE HIS TRIP.

WHILE NEGOTIATING A NINETY DEGREE LEFT TURN THE TRANSPORT UPSET ONTO ITS RIGHT SIDE AND SLID OFF OF THE ROADWAY INTO THE DITCH.  ALTHOUGH THE INNER VESSEL DID NOT RUPTURE THE OUTER JACKET WAS DAMAGED ENOUGH TO LOSE VACUUM.  THIS TYPE OF TRANSPORT RELIES ON A VACUUM BETWEEN THE OUTER SHELL AND INNER VESSEL FOR INSULATION. ONCE THE VACUUM WAS LOST THE PRODUCT BEGAN TO WARM MORE QUICKLY RAISING THE PRESSURE FASTER THAN THE RELIEF MECHANISMS COULD HANDLE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE UNIT WAS ON ITS SIDE AND ALL OF THE VAPOR LINES WERE BELOW THE LIQUID LEVEL.  TO AVOID LETTING THE PRESSURE EXCEED DESIGN CAPABILITIES A DECISION WAS MADE BY SANJEL PERSONNEL TO VENT THE LIQUID THROUGH WHATEVER VALVEING WAS AVAILABLE.  THIS WAS DONE BY RESPONDING CHINOOK FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL.  THE LIQUID NITROGEN WAS ALLOWED TO POOL IN THE DITCH WHERE IT VAPORIZED AND DISPERSED OVERNIGHT.  THIS ACCIDENT WAS THE RESULT OF DRIVER ERROR.  SPECIFICALLY THE DRIVERS SPEED AND IMPROPER BRAKING TECHNIQUE IN CONSIDERATION OFF THE LOAD HE WAS CARRYING.  THE ROAD SURFACE WAS LEVEL AND DRY.  THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT WAS THIRTY MILES PER HOUR, HOWEVER A CAUTIONARY SIGN SUGGESTED TWENTY MILES PER HOUR ON THIS PARTICULAR CURVE.  MONTANA HIGHWAY PATROL CALCULATED HIS SPEED AT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MILES PER HOUR, WITHIN THE LEGAL LIMIT, BUT OVER THE SUGGESTED SAFE SPEED.  THE DRIVER WAS NOT CITED FOR SPEEDING BUT AS A RESULT OF HIS FAILURE TO SAFELY NEGOTIATE HIS SELECTED ROUTE, HIS EMPLOYEE WITH SANJEL WAS TERMINATED.  PART VII - RECOMMENDATIONS/ACTIONS TAKEN TO PREVENT RECURRENCE.  1.  WE ESTABLISHED A POLICY WHERE ALL LIQUID BULK TRUCKS ARE OPERATED TEN MILES PER HOUR UNDER THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT.  2. WE ESTABLISHED A POLICY WHERE ALL CAUTIONARY SIGNS ARE STRICTLY ADHERED TO. 3.  ALL DRIVERS RECEIVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR LIQUID BULK TRANSPORTS PRIOR TO DRIVING SUCH LOADS.  THE TRAINING EMPHASIZES THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF LARGE LIQUID LOADS AND THE EFFORTS THAT MUST BE MADE TO SAFELY TRANSPORT THEM.  4.  BECAUSE THE INCIDENT WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF DRIVER ERROR NO RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE MADE AS FAR AS INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT. STANDARD OPERATION PROCEDURES ALREADY IN PLACE, HAD THEY BEEN PROPERLY ADHERED TO, WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS ACCIDENT.

The spill situation was extended because the emergency shutdown designed sequence closed the railcar vent valve preventing release of the pressure on the railcar. Third party failure analysis of the hose revealed a defect in the hose lining on unknown origin. Hose had been is use about one month at time of failure.    DETAILS of INCIDENT  At about 16:40 hr, the rail car unloading operator began unloading railcar PROX 16407 that contained 198,150 pounds of sulfuric acid. At about 17:00 hr, the unloading operator noted that the rail car appeared to be getting wet. He investigated and discovered sulfuric acid spraying on to the top of the rail car from a ruptured acid unloading hose. He immediately activated the emergency stop from a remote location, reported the release to plant personnel and began isolating the spill area by barricading the area with “Danger” tape. MDE was notified of the release at about 17:42. Since it appeared to be taking a long time for the pressure to dissipate, the plant air was manually closed upstream away from the spill area just in case the emergency stop had not functioned properly. Clean Harbors, a Haz Mat clean up company, was contacted to mobilize in preparation to clean up the area once the spill was stopped.    The emergency stop closes the air supply valve that supplies air pressure to unload the rail car. It also closes the sulfuric acid discharge and the air supply vent valve. This essentially shuts down the railcar. However, the railcar was under pressure and relieving through the unloading hose that had ruptured. The spray from the hose made it unsafe to approach the top of the railcar to vent the rail ca:r. Thus, the leak was allowed to continue to dissipate the pressure until it was safe to vent the railcar. The acid was spraying on top of the railcar, into the containment area, over the containment area wall onto a gavel area where some piping was temporarily stored and contractor equipment was parked. Some of the acid got onto a plant roadway and flowed into a plant drain that leads to the on site water reclamation plant where the acid was neutralized.    MDE arrived at about 18:13 hr. The spray was continuing as the rail car de-pressurizing. At about 19:30 hrs the MDE recommended that we advise the local fire department and LEPC of our s:ituation. Grace agreed and the MDE responder contacted the Baltimore City Fire Department. They arr:ved at about 19:45. We discussed the situation with them and determined that the rail car could be vented by cutting the air supply hose. This would allow the trapped air pressure in the rail car to back vent through the one-inch hose. Two fire fighters donned level “A” suits and proceed to the top of the railcar and cut the air hose at 20:30 hr. The railcar vented air through the cut hose and the spray ceased at 20:45. The Fire Department offered to wash down the spill area with their high volume fog nozzle. The company agreed and the area was washed for ab",Preventive Actions  1. Changed hose specification  2.

Prior to shipment, on June 4, 2004, DKE had sent a pre-shipment sample and waste  profile to DeMenno/Kerdoon for waste acceptance approval into their facility. On June 5,  2004 DeMenno/Kerdoon approved the waste profile for acceptance. A compatibility test  of equal amounts sampled from tank T-312 and the liquid portion from bin number 567  showed no evidence of reactivity when combined. (See attachment 1)  On 6/7/03 at approximately 2:15 p.m. the truck arrived at DKE. DKE personnel and the driver began to transfer (pump) 2,500 gallons of the caustic waste from tank T-31into his vacuum truck. The transfer was completed within 20 minutes, occurring during the time of 2:30 p.m. and 2:50 p.m.  At approximately 3:00 p.m. DKE personnel and the driver began to pump 2,000 gallons  of the liquid portion (oil/ oily emulsion) from bin number 576. The transfer was completed within 30 minutes.  At about 4:15 p.m. the Operations Manager observed steam and liquid releasing from the truck vacuum trailer’s center manway. Operations Manager began to order for an absorbent berm to be created to contain the release.  At 4:30 p.m. the Operations Manager requested that the Compliance Manager call 911 and report the release and request assistance from the Vernon Fire Department. DKE personnel were ordered to evacuate the facility.  At approximately 4:35 p.m. the Vernon Fire Department arrived and was informed that there appeared to be a reaction occurring within the truck vacuum trailer. Copies of the hazardous waste manifest, MSDS, waste profile, and laboratory analytical were available and presented to the Fire Department. U.S. Aluminum, neighboring business to the East, was evacuated and access to 26th street was prohibilled for approximately 5 hours.  DKE and The Vernon Fire Department agreed that cooling the exterior surface of the truck vacuum trailer with water until the reaction had settled or completed its process was the best mitigation procedure. (See attachment 2)  City water was used to cool the truck in timed intervals and temperature readings were taken of the exterior surface of the trailer and recorded. The temperature reading at about 6:00 p.m. was approximately 250°F.  At 5:30 p.m. DKE called out Asbury Environmental Services Emergency Response Unit to provide assistance with the incident. Arrival time was approximately 7:00 p.m.  At 8:00 p.m. the truck appeared stable and was cool enough so that samples could be taken from the truck vacuum container. At 8:30 p.m. the ER Entrance Team took samples. The Vernon Fire Department performed Hazcat testing on one sample and two other samples were sent to DeMenno/Kerdoon, a state certified lab, for analysis. The Hazcat results, although not conclusive, did indicate alkali metals within the sl","The facility must constantly be aware that the Generators do not always describe their waste properly.

UPON ARRIVAL AT THE FACILITY MR. STIMELING PREPARED TO MAKE THE DELIVERY.  ONCE ALL CONNECTIONS WERE MADE MR. STIMELING ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE DISCHARGE VALVE AND WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  HE THEN ACQUIRED A PRY BAR FROM THE CUSTOMER TO ASSIST IN OPENING THE VALVE. AS MR. STIMELING APPLIED PRESSURE IN A FURTHER ATTEMPT TO OPEN THE VALVE THE VALVE STEM SNAPPED.  AT THIS POINT MR. STIMELING ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THE VALVE WAS ALREADY OPEN AND HAD BEEN THAT WAY SINCE LEAVING THE FACILITY.  MR. STIMELING THEN CONTACTED JIM FLEISHER (HB-DISPATCHER) AND INFORMED HIM OF THE SITUATION.  NEXT, HE CONTACTED ROGER CRANE (HB-MAINTENANCE SUPERVISOR) TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION.  MR. CRANE INFORMED MR. STIMELING THE THAT COMPANY THAT INSPECTS HB'S TANKERS (MOBILE TANK INSPECTION, INC. [MTI]) WAS LOCATED IN NEPTUNE AND HE WOULD HAVE A TECHNICIAN SENT OUT TO REPAIR/REPLACE THE VALVE.  THE TECHNICIAN FROM MTI ARRIVED AND REPLACES THE VALVE.  ONCE THE NEW VALVE WAS INSTALLED, MR. STIMELING RECONNECTED AND STARTED TO UNLOAD THE SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE.  THE COMPOUND USED TO SECURE THE NEW VALVE WAS NOT DRY ENOUGH AND A SMALL LEAK/DRIP WAS DETECTED.  AT THIS POINT THE TECHNICIAN CLIMB UP ON TOP OF THE TANKER TO INSPECT THE LEAK.  AS SOON AS THE TECHNICIAN CLIMBED ON TO THE TOP OF THE TANKER THE NEW VALVE FAILED COMPLETELY RELEASING SODIUM HYPOCHLORITE.  THE AIR WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUT OFF THE DRIVER AND THE TECHNICIAN MADE THERE WAY TO THE SAFETY SHOWER, AND THE NEPTUNE EMPLOYEES WORKED TO CONTAIN THE SPILL.  AN ESTIMATED 30 TO 100 GALLONS WAS LOST ONTO THE ASPHALT PARKING LOT.  AFTER SHOWERING MR. STIMELING CONTACTED THE BRANCH TO REPORT THE INCIDENT.  AFTER EXITING THE SAFETY SHOWER NEITHER REQUIRED NOR REQUESTED MEDICAL ATTENTION.  THE DRIVER HAD BEEN WEARING ALL REQUIRED PPE, THE TECHNICIAN HAD NOT.  THE TECHNICIAN CHANGED CLOTHES THEN PROCEEDED TO INSTALL A FLANGED VALVE TO COMPLETE THE OFF LOAD.  PAUL ODONNEL (UNIVAR HB-BOM) CONTACTED THE FACILITY REPRESENTATIVE, CHRIS KELLY, TO OBTAIN ALL PERTINENT INFORMATION AND TO DETERMINE IF ADDITION ASSISTANCE WAS NEEDED FOR CLEANUP.  AT THIS TIME MR. KELLY STATED THAT THE FACILITY HAD THE MEANS TO HANDLE THE CLEAN UP AND DID NOT REQUIRE ANY ASSISTANCE FORM UNIVAR.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TRIP THIS TANKER WAS USED SINCE RETURNING FROM BEING REPAIRED AT AN OFF SITE LOCATION.  THE HB SR. FLEET MECHANIC WAS INTERVIEWED AND HE COULD NOT CONFIRM EITHER WAY IF THE VALVE WAS OPEN OR CLOSED WHEN THE TANKER RETURNED FROM BEING REPAIRED.

WHILE MAKING THE DELIVERY ONE OF THE FOUR DRUMS FELL FROM THE TRUCKS LIFTGATE ONTO THE GROUND.  UPON IMPACT THE TOP OF THE DRUM AND THE BUNG FAILED CAUSE THE LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY-FIVE GALLONS OF PRODUCT ONTO THE GRAVEL ROADWAY. THE SPILLED MATERIAL IMMEDIATELY SOAKED INTO THE ROADWAY AND THE BREECHED DRUM WAS UP-RIGHTED CONTAINING THE REMAINING FERRIC CHLORIDE.  AFTER SECURING THE DAMAGED DRUM, MR. BARNES CONTACTED PAUL ODONNELL (HB-BOM)TO INFORM OF THE SITUATION.  MR. ODONNELL CONTACTED THE FACILITY OPERATIONS MANAGER STEVEN TAYVINSKY TO OBTAIN INCIDENT DETAILS AND ESTABLISH FURTHER ACTIONS NEEDED.  MR. ODONNELL CONFIRMED THE SPILL WAS LESS THEN THE RQ (1000#) AND THE SPILL DID NOT GO OFF SITE.  AT THIS TIME MR. ODONNELL CONTACTED A CLEAN UP CONTRACTOR (EP&S) TO RESPOND TO THE SITE AND REMOVE THE EXPOSED GRAVEL.  DURING THE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DRIVE HAD ALL FOUR DRUMS RESTING ON THE EDGE OF THE LIFTGATE.  THIS IS DUE TO THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE DELIVERY.  THE DELIVERY VEHICLE HAS TO SIT ON AN INCLINE, WHICH MAKES REMOVING THE DRUMS FORM THE LIFTGATE DIFFICULT.  MR BARNES STATED THAT IT TAKES TWO PEOPLE TO SAFELY REMOVE THE DRUM FROM THE GATE.  AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT THE CUSTOMER HAD NOT YET REACHED THE TRUCK TO ASSIST THE DRIVER.  IN AN ATTEMPT TO REMOVE A DRUM, A SECOND DRUM WAS PUSHED FROM THE GATE CAUSING THE SPILL.  JIM FLEISHER (HB-DISPATCHER) MADE A TRIP TO THE SITE ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT AND CONFIRMED THE ACCESS TO THE DELIVER SITE WAS LESS THAN IDEAL.  MR. FLEISHER ALSO AGREES IT WOULD TAKE TWO PEOPLE TO SAFELY REMOVE THE DRUMS AND TAKE THEM TO THE WWTP.

THE TRACTOR-TRAILER ROLLED ON IT'S LEFT SIDE SKIDDING FOR APPROX. 47 YARDS, COMING TO REST BLOCKING TWO LANES OF FOUR LANES ON I-70.  THE TRAILER RECEIVED THREE SMALL HOLES AS A RESULT OF THE KIDDING. (EACH BEING APPROX. 6"")  THE HOLES RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF 7500 GALS OF JP8 JET FUEL. THE FUEL POOLED IN TWO AREAS, HOWEVER BECAUSE OF TORRENTIAL RAINS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT THE FUEL MADE IT'S WAY TO A CULVERT AND FOLLOWED A DITCH TO A SMALL STEAM BEFORE IT WAS CONTAINED. (APPROX. 3 MILES)  THE DRIVE (MR. BA) REPORTED ONLY MINOR INJURIES TO HIS HEAD AND WAS SEEN AT A LOCAL CLINIC. MR. BA WAS RELEASED AND INSTRUCTED TO RETURN TO THE CLINIC FOR FOLLOW-UP.

On June 9, 2004 between 1:00 AM and 2:00 AM, a trucker hooked his flexible hose from his truck to one of the 2 large asphalt storage tanks that is located outside the rear of the plant. The trucker claims that he observed proper filling procedures for 5 to 10 minutes before he violated the Polyglass required protocol by leaving the area, and abandoning proper surveillance. Approximately 5,800 gallons of asphalt were spilled from the trucker’s flexible pipe onto the surrounding asphalt pavement. The spill flowed down gradient in a 40’ wide path down to the fence line and beyond. The spill continued under the railroad tracks and through a corrugated pipe, covering a total running length of 150 feet. The spill extended 30 feet beyond the property line onto adjacent Cando-owned property before coming to a rest. No water was flowing in the drainage channel at the time of the incident nor did the spilled material reach any bodies of water.    At approximately 2:00 AM, the trucker became aware of his spill and he phoned his office supervisor, Justin Barletta, who immediately drove from the Hazleton area to the site. Mr. Barletta had difficulty assessing the extent of the spill because he arrived when it was still dark. Later, Mr. Barletta told Gary Snook of Polyglass that he optimistically thought the spill was rather small, and he thought his l.rucker had deposited most of the load into the large storage tank. At that point, they decided to wait for the mornirg when Gary Snook, the Plant Manager, would arrive, so they could discuss the episode with him.    Upon Gary’s arrival, he toured the area of concern with Mr. Barletta, and they realized the etent of the spill was much larger than thought. As they walked the spill area, they discovered a deer in the downstream field that had been killed by the asphalt.    Mr. Barletta then called his company’s (TBT Trucking, Hazieton, PA) spill response team (Datom), and they were said to be leaving their Dunmore office to arrive on-site at 9:30 AM. Gary Snook called CAG to implement the PPC Plan and to have CAG notify all appropriate regulatory authorities.
