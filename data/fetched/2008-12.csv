At the conclusion of the loading, while putting away the hoses, the driver noticed material leaking from the bottom of the trailer.  The shipper's technician and the driver quickly placed a bucket and absorbent pads under the trailer at the point of the leaks.  The driver vented the tank to releive the pressure but it had little effect.  The driver notified his supervisor, and two trucks were dispatched to the site in order to transfer the load.  Upon arrival, the replacement trailer was spotted and all required operational and safety controls were estabished in order to transfer the load onto the new trailer.  The transfer was conducted without issue.  Once empties, the original trailer was placed out of service and transported to a repair facility for inspection.  Upon inspection, it was determined that 2 wleds had failed allwing the material to escape from the trailer.  This trailer is currently out of service pending repairs.","Prior to dispatch of the vehicle, the driver confirmed that the trailer was current with all required inspections and the pre-trip inspection performed did not identify any signs of damage or leaking.  Upon indentifcation of the leak, the driver took all appropriate actions to safely contain the release and initiate an appropriate emergency response to prevent an escalation of the incident.

The Veolia office immediately contacted the driver of the truck who then pulled off the road and assessed the situation. The driver discovered an IBC (tote) was leaking hydrochloric acid solution. With the help of another Veolia technician, the spill in the truck was contained with oil dry and absorbent pads, and the crew returned to the Veolia, Blaine field office. It appears that the tote shifted sideways while in transit, made contact with the handle of a drum cart which resulted in a puncture to the plastic tote. It was estimated that approximately 75 gallons of material spilled out of the tote while the truck was in motion.","As a result of this incident, the requirement to properly block and brace all cargo to prevent and movement relative to the transport vehicle was reviewed with all field and transportation employees.

Product was evaporating upon contact with the ground.    CR Risk Mgr. A.Richter contacted emergency response contractor REACT, who examined the rail car to confirm the leak.  A small bucket with chemical absorbant pads was affixed to the bottom outlet valve for further work to be accomplished the following day.    12/13/08: REACT and CR Richter examined the outlet, insuring the valve and other closures were secured, then slowly removed the closure cap, whereby eventually approximately 2 pints of material were released into the previously placed containment system.  It was noted that the bottom outlet closure cap gasket was deformed due to age.  Gasket replaced in kind (Viton), and cap and closure plug resecured tool tight.  Outlet was re-examined approximately 1 hour later, with no further release noted.

The driver had paperwork that requires the customer representative to  sign prior to off-loading that states that their storage tank has the capacity to hold the shipment. The driver's responsibility during the off-loading is with the vehicle. The consignee employee's responsibility is to monitor the storage tank level.  The storage tank is out of the drivers view so when the tank level gets to a critical point the employee is to signal to the driver to stop the off-load.  The tank overflowed because the consignee employee assigned to monitor their storage tank left the area. Liquid level in the storage tank raised to a critical point and because air pressure is used to unload the tank trailer some of that pressure pushed the level even higher and some material vented out of the tank into a containment area.

The car was isolated and Chemtrec (report number 2008121000151) assisted in contacting the shipper, Ticona Company.  The consignee, Invista SARL, was requested to assist and found the liquid line valve closure plug less than tool tight with the valve in the closed position.  Invista representatives removed the closure plug, wrapped the threads with teflon tape, then re-installed and properly tightened the plug with a wrench.  Ticona representative Terreca Purdy was informed that due to the defective valve they must obtain an FRA Movement Approval prior to the car being released to destination.

When the IMTT Security employee approached the truck he noticed that product had spilled from the top of the tanker and along the side.  The Security employee contacted his supervisor and gave notice to the East gate that the vehicle not be allowed to exit the terminal.  As the truck proceeded to the East gate, product continued to spill out of the top of the tanker and onto the roadway.  The truck was held at the East gate and IMTT Emergency Response personnel arrived to survey the situation.  A strong solvent odor was detected.  IMTT contacted the on site emergency response contractor to dispatch to the area to clean up the tank trailer and the spilled product around the scale area.  The driver was asked to check his wash out caps and when he removed one them the gasket was found to be cracked and separated.  The driver replaced the gaskets on both wash caps and after the clean up operation the truck was permitted to proceed out of the terminal.  An IMTT vehicle escorted the truck out of the East gate and onto a main road to make sure that no additional product leaked from the truck.

He then loosened four nuts that held the plate in front of the screen in order to vent off propane gas in the line between the belly valve and the screen.  The belly valve air actuator piston did not travel its full travel so the belly valve was not really shut. As gas continued to   leak out he tried to close an auxiliary ball valve.  The handle turned but it did not shut off the flow. He tried to tighten the four nuts on the plate but an o ring had popped out of its seat. Finally the belly valve was manually closed by repeatedly striking on its external operating lever.,"We have changed our operating procedure on how to determine when the belly valve is closed. Instead of a visual check, we will hook up the delivery hose to the tank and pump through the meter. We will then shut the valve and if the meter stops we will know the valve is truly off.  We will also only vent off vapor by loosening a fitting on top of the vapor eliminator instead of the bolts that hold the plate.

While unloading, the ball valve on the adaptor viborated open which allowed product to leak out. Driver recognized the problem and shut and secured the ball valve. Driver than shut down the product transfer and and with the help of the customer's operator, cleaned up the spilled material. Driver replaced the fitting and continued with product delivery without further incident.","Upon inspection of the fitting in question it was found that the there were two problems involving the blow down ball valve mounted on the fitting.  The first issue was the locking device. it was damaged which through viboration allowed it to slip back on the handle of the valve. second, the valve itself was  loose due to use.  Both together allowed the valve to viborate open.  The other issue was with the driver, he did not recognize the problems with the valve in the first place.

Maersk took possession of the container in Tacoma for corrective action.","The container was full of double stacked plastic totes in aluminum framed baskets containing UN3265.  From the pictures that were taken, it seems apparent that the totes were not made to be stacked, since there are no landing pads/slots at the top of the tote basket to receive the upper tote. The upper tote rested on the tote below and pictures show the upper tote's weight depressed the lower tote.

At 19:45 pm on 12/10/08 Employee Bryan Karalas was unloading the trailer and moving the freight to the proper outbound loading doors.  He entered the trailer that contained shipment 831-635350 and picked up the pallet that had been loaded immediately behind.  He failed to judge his forklift blade distance and proceeded forward too far to where his forkblades protruded beyond the end of the pallet he was picking up and into the bottom of the 55 gallon drum.  The contents of the drum spilled onto the trailer floor and concrete pad beneath the trailer.  The spill containment kit was utilized to lay out barriers to prevent the spread of the spill, and the dock was evacuated as a precautionary measure.  Belfor Environmental was contacted for further instructions and advised to remain 300 feet off the dock until they arrived to the scene.  Belfor cleaned up the spill and trailer on site.  Conway Manager of Safety Jeff Turner was also immediately notified of the spill.","The spill resulted from an employee failing to take the required precautions with respect to correct forklift procedures.  The employee received written disciplinary action, will be retrained in forklift safety and recertified on a forklift prior to being permitted to operate a forklift.  He will also watch a loading & unloading techniques video (I.C.E.) and will complete a written quiz.  The employee has also been counselled regarding his actions which led to the spill.",No,DRUM METAL,Metal drum,DRUM MTL,No,,,,,,,4,0,0,1,0,0,14,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,6500,CON-WAY FREIGHT,US,

The car was isolated and shipper, local, and state agencies as applicable were notified. CHEMTREC Report #2008-12-10-00081.  Summit Contracting, a CSXT response contractor, was dispatched to the scene.  The car was moved to the mechanical department where it was noted that 3 of the 4 bottom unloading gates were allowing the product to leak.  Seals were intact on operating fixtures but the ratchet closures were not tight enough and the mechanical department was able to properly secure the openings.  Contractor personnel cleaned up spilled material and loaded into three 55 gallon drums with an estimated weight of 400 pounds each.  The leak was secured and the car released for transport.

BNSF contract responders were called to inspect AGCX 10036 and remediate spillage. The local F.D. on scene advised to cordon-off an area 50 meters around AGCX 10036 until hazardous material responders completed securement inspection of AGCX 10036 and remediated any spillage. Yard operations were suspended accordingly. Responder inspection of AGCX 10036 revealed product staining around the manway nozzle and down both sides of the side shell. No active release was noted at this time. Two manway securement lug nuts were found to be less than tool tight. The manway gasket was inspected along with the product outage and both were deemed OK. The manway cover was closed and properly resecured. All other valves and fittings were inspected with no exceptions noted. Spillage on the tank shell evaporated and ground impact spillage was treated with an application of MicroBlaze. Yard operations resumed at 2225 hrs. CST, 12/26/08.    On 12/29/08, the responders returned and pressured up AGCX 10036 with insertion of nitrogen into this tank car. This pressure test revealed product leaking from the liquid line valve's mounting flange area. The mounting flange bolts were less than tool tight and the responder tool tightened these flange bolts and afterwards no further product leaks were noted. No other leaks were detected. Another application of MicroBlaze was applied to the ground impact area of the 12/26/08 spill and the ballast/soil was churned to expedite the microbial penetration and its' effectiveness.  AGCX 10036's side specification stencil indicated that the last tank qualification was completed in the year 2006 and next due in 2016.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Non-pressure,111AW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,11435,BNSF Railway Company,US,

Upon arrival at the GE Betz, Orange, TX facility, representative samples of the waste water were collected from the top and bottom of the trailer and submitted to a NELAP-accredited lab for flashpoint analysis.  Initial written results indicated that the flashpoints of the samples were greater than 200 degrees Fahrenheit confirming that the wastewater was not a hazardous material and that it was within the waste profile parameters.  Based upon this information, GE Betz reshipped the wastewater in trailer #7282 on Dec. 5, 2008 to the destination facility in Baton Rouge, LA as a ""Non DOT Regulated"" wastewater.                While the trailer was in route to the destination facility, the laboratory contacted GE Betz and stated that the written preliminary results were inaccurate and that the wastewater actually exhibited a flashpoint of 153 degrees Fahrenheit.  GE Betz contacted Quality Carriers dispatch and instructed to Quality Carriers to redirect trailer #7282 back to the GE Betz facility in Orange, TX.                          The wastewater was subsequently classified and shipped as a Combustible Material N.O.S.

Modification to waste shipment procedures include a 1-hour pre-departure tanker truck holding timeand sampling of the top an bottom layer of the tanker to help ensure material stratification within the tanker has not occurred.

Driver grabbed fire-extinguisher and upon return to rear of trailer, tried to put out fire the engulfed rear inside tire. Fire became beyond fire extinguisher capability and driver moved away fromthe area. The fire impacted the rubber lining of the trailer which led to the contents, hydrochloric acid solution, to reach the aluminum shell of the trailer.

At the time of shipment, the wastewater did not meet the definition of hazardous material.  The loaded trailer departed for Baton Rouge, LA on the evening of Tuesday, Dec. 2, 2008 as a ""Non-DOT Regulated"" material.  The trailer was staged at a Quality Carrier yard overnight and arrived at the destination facility the next morning.  On Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2008, a sample of wastewater from trailer #7282 was collected and analyzed for disposal purposes by the destination facility.  The analytical results indicated a flashpoint outside of the wastewater profile parameters causing the load to be rejected by the treatment facility.  The destination facility contacted GE Betz on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2008 to request that the rejected load be removed from the destination facility.  Trailer #7282 was then transported from the destination facility back to the GE Betz facility in Orange, TX and arrived on the evening of Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2008.      Additional analytical testing conducted by GE Betz contracted third-party laboratory confirmed that the material in trailer #7282 underwent a phase separation after it was shipped from the GE Betz facility that caused a thin layer of material in the storage trailer to exhibit the hazardous material characteristic of combustibility (flash point of 153 degrees Fahrenheit).  The proper shipping name of the resultant wastewater was Combustible Material N.O.S. (Naphthalene Solution), NA 1993, PG III.

Modification to waste shipment procedures include a 1-hour pre-departure tanker truck holding time and sampling of the top and bottom layer of the tanker to help ensure material stratification within the tanker has not occurred.  Procedure changes were communicated to applicable facility personnel.  The facility has implemented a semiannual cleaning procedure of the wastewater storage tank to prevent the accumulation of an organic or bi-layering of the wastewater in the storage tank.

This crew moved away from the odor source area and yard operations were ceased. The local F.D. and EMT's were called. The EMT's examined two crew members at the railyard facility finding no inhalation or medical issues with these two employees and they were able to return to work. A BNSF hazardous material response contractor was called to inspect suspect tank cars and eliminate the odor source. Responder inspection revealed PSPX 22145 (DOT 105J500W tank car) as the odor source. Intact seal numbered CPC 242041 was removed from the valve housing cover. The A-end liquid valve was found to be leaking from around its' valve stem area. Responders attempted to tighten the valve stem packing nut, but liquid product escaped when the packing nut was tightened. The packing nut was removed from the stem along with the locking ring and spacer ring. The locking ring appeared slightly bent which likely attributed to binding on the valve stem and asserting uneven pressure on the stem packing when the packing nut was tightened, allowing a small amount of liquid product to seep out. A Midland capping kit was ordered to encapsulate the leaking liquid valve. PSPX 22145 was carefully moved and isolated in a siding just outside the railyard and air monitoring was initiated while responders awaited the arrival of the capping kit. Yard operations were resumed at 1300 hrs. CST, 12/21/08. After the Midland capping kit arrived around 1400 hrs. CST, the responders again attempted to repair the leak location at the liquid valve stem. Additional packing material was inserted and the imperfect locking ring was removed. Afterwards, the packing nut was tightened and no visible leaks were noted. The valve was cycled and no leakage was detected. Spillage within the valve housing area was cleaned. The valve housing cover was resealed with seal numbered SRS 000266. Response was concluded at 1630 hrs. CST, 12/21/08.   PSPX 22145 was returned to the shipper.  PSPX 22145's side specification stencil indicated that the last tank qualification was completed in the year 2007 and next due in 2017.",Ensure shipper's pre-trip inspection process is fully implemented and validated as it relates to the total securement and mechanical fitness of all valves and fittings.,No,TANK CAR,Pressure,105JW,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,8700,BNSF Railway Company,US,

When driver walk to rear of trailer driver saw fire coming from the brake area on driver side of unit, driver returned to cab to get his fire extinguisher to put fire out.  Driver could not stop the fire so he called 911 for help.  Greenland Volunteer Fire Department and the NH State Police responded to scene.  Fire Chief Ralph Cresta ordered the highway closed and the surrounding homes evacuated because of unknown hazards.  After the fire was out the homes were allowed back, which was less than 30 minutes time.

UTLX 202192 was up-righted in a position which ended further product release at the VRV and from the hole in the tank head. The fire was then extinguished. Also, after up-righting UTLX 202192, a small product leak developed at the bottom outlet area as the bottom outlet valve was sheared off in the derailment. This spillage was contained and captured. The remaining product inside UTLX 202192 was transferred in tank trucks for delivery to the consignee. Captured spillage atop the ground along with a mix of fire retardant foam and water was placed into portable totes for future disposal.  UTLX 202192 was deemed destroyed and it was cleaned and purged of all hazardous material.  (B)A BNSF westbound train derailed 37 railcars on BNSF main track.

Driver is not involved in loading process; Honeywell employees load truck and seal dome. Driver left facility and drove down Chippawa St.  He noticed product spilling onto Chippawa St. approximately 1/4 mile long.  The product also pooled where the truck was stopped.  The external valve handle indicated to be in the closed postion.  A cap was not covering the end of the unload hose.  This would have prevented product release even though the valve was stuck open.  US Environmental was called to the scene and cleaned up the spill. The truck and trailer were then driven back to Honeywell and a new external valve was installed on the trailer.  The load was then delivered to its destination.  The tank had been recently tested.  The tests performed and dates are as follows:           V 09-08, I 10-08, K 10-08, L 10-08, P 10-08, UC 0-08, & T 12-08.","Basically, the spill occurred as a result of mechanical failure of an air actuated external valve.  Pressure built up in the tank causing product to flow into the unload hose through the defective valve.  A cap should have been placed on the unload hose end.  This would have kept product from spilling into the environment during transportation, but the driver would have been splashed when the cap was removed from the hose to unload product.  In the future, we will train our employees to make sure the air actuated valves are in the closed position and hoses are capped prior to movement on the highway.",Yes,TANK,cargo tanks,DOT 412,Yes,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,6896,"MARTIN TRANSPORT, INC.",US,

Accident Report   Date: December 6, 2008   Written by: Peggy Roark   On December 6, 2008 one of our transport trucks turned over at the intersection of   Beltway 8 and S. Post Oak. The driver, Carl Dunlap reported that he stopped at the red light at the intersection of Beltway 8 and S. Post Oak, after the light turned green, he moved from the left lane to the right lane and continued through the intersection, to make the curve he swung wide and made a buttonhole turn. As he was straightening the   vehicle out, the load shifted and the truck and trailer rolled over. See Diagram of   accident. The driver got out of the truck uninjured and there was no other vehicle or persons involved in the accident. The Houston Police Department DOT responded to the accident and the driver was not sited for the accident. The Report number is CP# 0265076 and a copy is attached. The driver was tested that evening for drugs and   alcohol and the reports came back clean.   The truck was carrying 8501 gallons of gasoline. There was spill of 1590 gallons of unleaded gasoline. The remainder of the fuel was pumped out of the overturned truck and taken to another fueling location. There was a small rupture in the bottom of the trailer in compartment 1. The truck remained on its side which placed the rupture near the top of the tank, which limited the amount of fuel lost. The total gallons lost were 1590 gallons. All the lost fuel went into a storm drain that was located near the overturned truck.   Garner Environmental Services was hired to investigate and remediate the lost fuel. Garner Environmental Services was retained to handle the clean up. I am attaching a copy of the Response Report from Garner Environmental which reports the spill to be complete.   Garner Environmental contact person is John Pavlicek 713-817-1395. Dennis Alverez with the City of Houston was present. Mr. Alverez was on site the night of the accident and on the subsequent trip to remove the fuel from the storm drain. Mr. Alverez can be reached at: Office 713-293-2069 or Cell 713-293-2069. I can be reached at 713-223- 0231.
