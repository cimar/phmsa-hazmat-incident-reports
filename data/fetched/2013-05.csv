SWS Environmental inspected the trailer and discovered two (2) damaged cartons, each containing four (4) one-gallon plastic jugs.  Two jugs inside one of the cartons were damaged.

DEA has a freezing point of 86 degrees F.    Package did not fail.    The loading spout was short and secured to the trailers dome collar with a clamp.  Residual DEA from prior loading activities is believed to have been frozen within the loading hose, in low spots.  This resulted in fluctuations in pressure during this loading activity.  These fluctuations resulted in the clamp working free and a sudden increase in pressure forced the spout up onto the top of the trailer.","1. The exisiting load spout inserts into the trailer dome 12”, and uses a single wing clamp to stabilize and secure the spout. There is no deflector attached to the end of the load spout to redirect the upward pressure from loading, in order to keep the spout from attempting to rise out of tank during loading.   Design - Load spout should at a minimum insert into tank 30” and have a deflector installed, and use a lock down bar attachment to stabilize load spout.  These enhancements are being reviewed by operations for application.    2. Current loading design uses hoses. This design uses a sling to support hoses in the overhead. The DEA hose essentially has two low spots where product can settle and freeze (freezing point is 86 degrees F). The hose is not heat traced nor insulated to prevent freezing.  Design - operations is investigating options for heat tracing, insulating the hoses.      3. It has been a standard practice at the Chester Terminal to remove frozen product at the end of the hose by “digging it out” and then installing the load spout.  The loading process would then begin.   Operational Training - Employees have been training to recognize that when an abnormal condition is identified they must “STOP” and notify Supervision.",No,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Kinder Morgan Terminals,US,

While traveling, Jensen Transport vehicle was clipped by a train, which caused truck to rollover onto its side and release product.  The capacity of the tanker is 40,000 pounds.  The Local Fire Department responded to apply water to the overturned tanker and reduce vapor cloud emitting from the cargo tank.  Immediate area was evacuated as a precautionary measure, due to the heavy vapors.  Swift County Emergency Management Agency and Chemical Assessment Team responded to assess the site, along with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.  West Central Environmental Consultants of Morris, Minnesota was dispatched to assist in cleanup.  Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railyard contracted Specialized Response Solutions (SRS) to transfer product from the damaged tanker, into a rescue tanker provided by Jensen Transport.   Approximately 20,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were recovered into the rescue tanker.  The Local Fire Department continued to spray water onto the damaged tank until no further vapors were released.  West Central Environmental Consultants proceeded to recover the contaminated waters from the site.  Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health were on site to monitor the air and ensure safe levels within immediate area.  WCEC pulled soil samples from the adjacent soils in the area, per Minnesota DOT, and site will be monitored to ensure all levels of contamination have been recovered.",Jensen Transport will continue to train and reinforce safe handling procedures and driver safety to all personnel.,Yes,TANK,"Tank truck, tank mounted on truck chassis",TANK TRK,Yes,,,,,,,1,0,1,3,1,0,5,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,1150000,SPILL CENTER INC.,US,

He stepped away from washing the the dome area to secure and place the sample bottle away for the lab on his equipment.  He continued to process paperwork and started to drive towards the truck scale, completely forgeting to tighten the dome lid bolts.  He weighed the trailer at the scale and did not notice that some product had spilled from the domelid area on the scale at 4:03 PM.  Once he reached the curb on S. Wilminton Avenue out of Rhodia driveway, Rhodia employees noticed that the trailer#171 had leaked some product on the scale and scrambled to check if it was 93% Sulfuric or water.    Meanwhile, Jose proceeded out of the Rhodia facility driving towards Del Amo intersection on Wilmington Avenue unaware the spill had occurred at Rhodia Driveway & scale area.  When Jose reached the intersection of Del Amo and Wilmington, product also spilled at the intersection from the domelid area.  This spill was concentrated only on the right hand lane close to the property of Rhodia. Jose continued to drive toward the railroad track after crossing the intersection of Del Amo & Wilmington where he made the mandatory stop at the railroad crossing.  At that point, he looked in the side view mirror to see if he could move forward, & he noticed a puddle of liquid at the intersection leading upto his trailer where he was.  He proceeded to stop the trailer away from the railway crossing and started to make calls & place the safety cones to block the street of vehicles from getting 93% Sulfuric acid on their equipment.  Due to the rush hour traffic, he proceeded to call 911 to help with assiting the traffic flow, there was also a risk of product entering the storm drain.  Jose continued to place absorbant pads near the storm drain and prevented a majority of the product from entering the storm drain.    Rhodia personnel called our dispatch simultaneously while Jose was calling us to inform of the spill.  Phone calls were made to DOM, ROM and WER Regulatory Manager regarding the incident & all the pertinent agencies were informed soon after.  Incident # with CalEPA is 13-2778 & NRC#104-6476.","Several changes have been recommended by employees and invetigating team to prevent from happening in the future;  • Completed Incident investigation – all action items have been completed, the action items completed are:           1.

They allowed us to dispatch a truck around 7am on 5-3-13. Representatives were allowed on scene around 8:30 am to pump out any remaining material from the trailer.  By then there were Sorbent pads under the trailer and truck and snakes were placed down the ditch for 300 to 500 ft.    Hazmat was steadily release from a tear towards the front of the trailer approximately 12 inches in length for approximately 14 hours.,"We Acknowledge this question; however we will have a better plan of action to reort following our Federal D.O.T. audit scheduled for June, 10, 2013.

The tank car was isolated. The shipper, Marathon Petroleum, was notified via direct phone call to Roger Spring 606-922-7208. Quick Response, a CSXT emergency response contractor, was dispatched to the Russell Yard. Quick Response found the reclosing external pressure relief device (PRD) faulty and in an open position thus allowing the release of product and vapors. The PRD was wrapped with plastic to contain all odors until a permanent repair could be made. The residual material on the tank car was neutralized. The shipper representative, Roger Spring, was notified of the situation found and was to make arrangements to have a qualified repair facility replace the PRD. Marathon Petroleum will secure an OTMA 3 after replacement of the PRD and then have the tank car requalified at their facility.     This incident did require a special move.

DSR notified me(David Dubey) I walked into the trailer and determined it was comming from one of the big tanks of liquid nitrogen. I called the emergency contact on the b.o.l. and spoke with Dave Stout(Air Products) 1-610-481-2518. at that point Dave told me it was probably a relief valve, he said they were meant to do that. Dave said when the valve stopped leaking then we could move the tanks. I called Larry Fennell let him know what was going on. I kept checking the trailer for the leak and it was still leaking. about two hours after the original discovery of the leak I called Dave Stout again. He said it should stop after a little while. So, Dan Sulich and I have been in contact everyday with Air Products and Chemicals letting them know this is still leaking. They said the same thing stay out of the trailer and after it's done leaking then we can deliver the rest of the freight. I called Larry Fennell on 5/9/2013 and Larry told me to contact the customer and tell them they need to take care of this today or we will have to call someone in to do it. I called the emergency contact number 1-610-481-7711 at Air Products and they are currently finding me someone to come take care of their freight.",,No,,PORTABLE TANK,NO MARKI,Yes,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,0,0,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,Con-way Freight,US,

TRHU 236961 was immediately taken to the facility's containment area for lading inspection. Contract responders reported finding two 55 gallon steel drums with rolling hoop damage consisting of creases with one inch fractures at the end of these creases. The lading inside TRHU 236961 showed no signs of in transit load shifting, therefore it was likely that the drum damage incurred during drum loading at origin. Both leaking drums were placed into overpack/disposal drums along with another drum that was damaged but not leaking. All three damaged drums were earmarked for off-site disposal.

The odor source was thought to be dried residue spillage (from loading) on the tank shell and responders cleaned this spillage using bleach, a bio-degradable cleaner and then wiped. Afterwards, re-inspection of UTLX 23310 by responders due to a faint commodity odor still detectable revealed that the vacuum relief valve (VRV) was the source point of the odor/vapor release. The faulty VRV that would not reseat was removed and a bolted flange plate was applied over the vacated VRV orifice by 1545 hrs. CDT, 5/14/2013, thus eliminating any further vapor/odor releases.

While traveling, vehicle was involved in an accident, which damaged the cargo tanker, and caused a fire to ignite in vehicle.  Approximately 7,700 gallons of diesel fuel were lost as a result of the accident and subsequent fire.  Local Fire Department and Dauphin County Hazmat responded to assess the site.  Local Fire Department responded to assess the site and extinguish the fire.  The water applied to extinguish the fire, mixed in with the diesel fuel released from the vehicle, and traveled into the storm drain system, which led to Paxtons Creek, eventually entering into the lake at the Wildwood Park Nature Reserve.  Pennsylvania DEP and Dauphin County Hazmat deployed hard boom and absorbent boom to the affected area to assist in containment efforts.   Environmental Products & Services of VT responded to perform the cleanup.  EP&S of VT utilized vacuum trucks to recover diesel fuel and water from Paxtons Creek and the Wildwood Preserve Lake.

The release impacted the parking lot, drains and a retention pond, but did not escape the site. The contractor plugged the punctured hole and the remaining fuel was delivered to the truck stop and put into the UST's on site.

While traveling,  truck was involved in a single-vehicle accident, which caused vehicle to rollover onto its side, damaging freight inside the trailer.  State and local authorities responded to assess the site, to include Winfield Fire Department, Putnam County EMS, Putnam County Sheriff's Department, WV Department of Transportation, Nitro, St. Albans, and Charleston FD personnel, and WV Department of Highways.  Hurricane Wrecker was contacted to recover vehicle and assist in stabilizing trailer during offload.  Haz-Tech Environmental was dispatched to perform the cleanup, and DOW Chemical, shipper of product, was on site to oversee response actions.  Approximately 300 gallons of corrosive liquid, toxic, n.o.s. were releaed from the damaged freight, and approximately 150 gallons of diesel fuel were released from the saddle tanks on the vehicle.  Haz-Tech Environmental offloaded the freight from the damaged trailer, repalletized, and reloaded onto a recovery trailer provided by Hurricane Wrecker.  Nine (9) 55-gallon drums were discovered damaged inside the trailer, which were overpacked and placed onto recovery trailer, along with 71 unbreached drums.  HazTech Environmental used a vacuum truck to recover free liquids from immediate area and nearby storm drain catch basins, and excavated the contaminated soils.  Free product was contained to immediate drains, and did not migrate or threaten waters of the state.  Approximately 800 gallons of liquid waste, 14 tons of contaminated soils and absorbents, and nine (9) overpack drums were generated during initial response.  Absorbent boom was left on site, as a precautionary measure, to prevent residual contamination.  Confirmation samples were pulled and site is being monitored, pending closure.  Disposal was coordinated in accordanced with local, state, and federal regulations.

Movement was stopped and PROX 40434 was isolated awaiting inspection by contract responders. Responders' inspection revealed that the leak source was at the closed liquid valve's valve stem. PROX 40434 deemed safe to move was carefully moved to the facility's containment area (drip pit) for additional inspection and securement. Responders reported the liquid valve's valve stem packing retainer plate was loose with one stud nut missing and the other less than tool tight (finger loose). A replacement stud nut was procured and applied to the bolt stud. Both stud nuts were than properly tool tightened which ended any further commodity release from the liquid valve's valve stem.

While traveling on Highway 60 near mile post 238 the tractor-trailer unit was involved in a vehicle accident.  As a result of the accident, the tractor and trailer unit rolled-over, resulting in damage to the tractor and a leak from one of the stainless steel tanks on the trailer.  Approximately 30 gallons of diesel fuel and 20 gallons of sulfuric acid were released and impacted the asphalt roadway surface and soil adjacent to the shoulder of the road.  The Arizona Department of Transportation responded to assess the site.  Environmental Response, Inc. was dispatched to complete the cleanup.  The unit was up-righted and the remaining product was removed from the two tanks on the trailer.  Environmental Response, Inc. deployed absorbent material to contain the free liquid on the impacted asphalt surface.

The lost product had flowed into a bouldery area with shallow groundwater at approximately 2 feet, so the product was found in many small pools.  The vac truck recovered product for three days.

Our SOP for this type of work is to strap any tote to the mast of the fork truck if you are doing anything with the tote besides loading it on a truck. This employee did not follow those instructions. To clean the discharge area of the tote properly, he needed to raise the forks approximately 3 feet. In doing so, he did not realize the tote, as it was positioned on the forks, was in a forward slant. There was already water on the forks and the base of the tote is plastic. After he stopped the fork truck and raised the forks, the material was sloshing back and forth just enough to cause the tote to slide. As the tote slid off the tip if the forks, the front, or top of the tote fell forward and down while the back of the was going to drop. When it did, all in one motion, the base of the tote hit the ground. At that point the base broke in two as two of the plastic bolts that hold the base of the tote to the bottom of the tote broke at the point of impact. This action caused the bottom of the tote itself, split open. That crack, or separation is jagged and approx 24 inches long. Fortunately, the tote was in our Wash Rack area that has collection basins and floor drains that empty into our Neutralization Tanks. From the time the tote hit the floor until the material actually stopped seeping through the crack was approximately 15 minutes. The remainder of the material that was left in the tote was pumped over into a couple of 55 gallon plastic drums. This tote was manufactured by Snyder Industries in February, 2000. Tote serial # 0002345342-","The employee responsible for this action is a 42 year veteran of Chemicals Incorporated, with an impeccable safety record. I don't feel our procedures should be changed as they work well for us when followed properly. The type, size and material of construction are exactly what should be for this material. I feel that any tote would have failed under the same conditions.

The pallet was loaded in the nose of the trailer on Friday along with other pallets of freight so the load would be ready for departure on the following Monday morning. Harcros Chemicals driver, Richard Jensen, while in route to make a delivery, thought he may have a problem. He found a safe place to get off the road and called his Manager. When checking, he found that one drum of Bleach in the nose of the trailer had busted. He immediately placed the drum on its side and put absorbent in the area where the material was.",The drum had built up pressure inside the trailer over the weekend and evidently the vented bung did not work properly by allowing pressure to escape the drum. The drum split on the side approximately 12 inches from the bottom of the drum. The four drums of Bleach with vented bungs should not have been loaded on the trailer and sat for three days in the heat which caused the pressure to expand in one of the drums.

This shipment contained twenty-five two ml vials of a cell bank of Clostridium botulinum, intended for offsite storage, and should have been shipped under the proper shipping name of ""Infectious substance, affecting humans UN 2814/Class 6.2 C. botulinum. "" consistent with Revance's internal approved shipping procedure and applicable DOT/IATA regulations. The shipment arrived safely and undamaged to its intended and approved recipient by cargo airplane. The incident was discovered by the recipient and Revance Therapeutics Inc. was notified on 05/23/2013. Revance immediately investigated the incident and discovered the omission was due to an oversight of the shipping employee. The employee had incorrectly concluded that the lATA-Biological Substance, Category B, Class 6.2, UN3373 classification was applicable to any shipment in a freeze dried solid state and that the shipment was finished product containing Botulinum Toxin Type A, which would have been correctly classified as an IATA biological product. Although the employee had completed all required external and internal training prior to the incident, the employee mistakenly deviated from the internal approved shipping procedure. The employee has received additional training and now clearly understands that the lATA-Biological Substance, Category B, Class 6.2, UN3373 classification is applicable only to finished biological products and that is not to be applied based on the physical state of the material being shipped.",Revance's shipping request form and operating procedures are being changed to ensure that the person requesting shipments containing C. botulinum or Botulinum Toxin properly classifies all materials to be shipped with the correct proper shipping name prior to shipment. The procedures will also implicitly state categories of different materials and their respective proper shipping names. All employees shipping or requesting material to be shipped will be retrained on the new approved procedures with respect to proper classification to prevent future occurrences of this type. These procedural changes will ensure that the material will be properly classified by the person who understands its properties best before the materials are offered for shipment.,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box,4G,No,,,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,REVANCE THERAPEUTICS INC,US,

The mail shipment originated in New York (JFKIA) and was accepted by Emirates from the United States Post Office as a mail consignment, under document number CN38: US53AJF11644.  The parcel was then transported on flight EK204 on June 01st, 2013 from JFK International Airport to Dubai International Airport.  The shipment was packaged in a way that prevented Emirates’ handling staff from verifying its contents without opening the parcel. Contents were discovered during a routine x-ray screening of transit mail by the Dubai Police.  After Dubai Police opened the package, it was discovered that the internal containers contained perfume bottles in original packaging.  Hazmat documentation was not provided to Emirates by the shipper at the time of tender.  After classifying shipment as suspect D.G., Emirates contacted the shipper for confirmation of the contents.  At which point the shipper confirmed that the perfumes had been shipped in the US Mail in error.  The shipment is currently being held in Dubai, until shipper appoints an agent to perform proper markings, labeling, and documentation.  Only after all IATA/ICAO and FAA requirements have been met, the shipment will be moved to its final destination of Mahe, Seychelles.",,No,BOX FIBER,Fiberboard box or carton,BOX FBR,No,,ZZ,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,No,0,EMIRATES SKYCARGO,US,

The driver noted a funny smell when he opened the door but started to unload the trailer.  After he removed a few pieces he noticed there was a green puddle in the middle of the trailer.  He then removed the dunnage from around the next 2 pieces of freight and saw one was a 120 gallon tote that was covered in a green liquid that appeared to be dry.  When I approached the trailer I did not notice a smell but did see the green puddle and residue on the top and sides of the tote in question.  I retrieved the Hazmat Bill from the driver and looked up the shipping name.  When I saw that it was toxic as well as corrosive I shut the trailer door and dock door as well and instructed the Supervisor not to open the door up until I called the safety department.

The spillage was contained by absorbent booms and granular absorbent. HLXU 116546 was up righted onto protective plastic sheeting. Lading inspection revealed two composite poly IBC's incurred punctures by their outer metal framing system which was damaged during interior load shift impacts when HLXU 116546 landed on its side. Also, other IBC's were noted with commodity seepage from their closure caps. The free commodity liquid on the asphalt was vacuumed with absorbent materials collected. Afterwards, the ground impact area was power-washed. The remaining commodity within the leaking IBC's was transferred into other suitable IBC's. After all lading in HLXU 116545 was removed, inspected for damages and decontaminated; the interior of HLXU 116545 was power-washed and cleaned. Several other non-leaking IBC's were transferred into new suitable IBC's due to outer metal frame damage and spilled commodity contamination.

UNIT 1, A TRACTOR TRAILER HAD GONE THROUGH THE GUARDRAIL AND DOWN AN EMBANKMENT. THE SEMI ROLLED OVER AN UNDETERMINED AMOUNT OF TIMES, HIT SEVERAL TREES ON A WOOD LINE, AND CAME TO REST ON THE DRIVER SIDE. THERE WAS A STRONG ODOR OF DIESEL FUEL AND FIRE UNITS FOUND THAT DIESEL FUEL WAS LEAKING FROM THE TRUCK IN TO THE CORN FIELD BEHIND THE TREE LINE. FIRE UNITS WORKED ON CUTTING THE DRIVER FREE FROM THE SEMI. HE WAS REMOVED AND TRANSPORTED TO OMHS. FIRE UNITS WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE FUEL WAS COMING FROM THE TANKS THE TRACTOR AND NOT THE TRAILER. THE TRUCK WAS HAULING A TANKER THAT HAD APPROXIMATELY 8500 GALLONS GASOLINE. NONE OF THE GASOLINE HAD BEEN REPORTED TO THIS DEPUTY TO HAVE LEAKED FROM THE TANKER AFTER LEAVING THE SCENE. DAVIESS CO. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND STATE FIRE MARSHALL WERE ALSO ON SCENE DUE TO THE FUEL LEAK. THE DIESEL FUEL THAT ESCAPED FROM THE TRACTOR HAD RUN OFF ON TO A DITCH NEARBY. A BACK HOE WAS BROUGHT IN AND THEY CONSTRUCTED A DAM TO STOP MORE FUEL FROM GETTING IN THE DITCH. EMA AND THE FIRE MARSHALL CONTACTED A COMPANY TO COME IN AND PUMP THE FUEL OUT OF THE TANKER BEFORE MOVING IT. A LAWN CARE COMPANY WAS ALSO CALLED IN TO REMOVE THE TREES THAT WERE KNOCKED DOWN BY THE SEMI AND THAT WERE UNDER THE SEMI. MCCARTY'S TOWING CAME TO REMOVE THE TRUCK. THE STATE ROAD DEPT. ALSO ARRIVED TO PUT UP BARRELS WERE THE GUARDRAIL HAD BEEN KNOCKED OUT AND TO CLOSE THE RAMP SO THAT CREWS COULD CLEAN THE WRECK UP. THE DAMAGED PROPERTY WAS A GUARDRAIL AND STREET LIGHT. THE DIRT FROM THE FIELD WAS ALSO CONTAMINATED AND HAD TO BE REMOVED. THE FIELD ALSO HAD CROP PLANTED AND WAS DESTROYED. THE OWNER OF THE FARM IS JOE GOETZ. HE STATED THAT THE FARM DOES NOT HAVE AN ADDRESS BUT IS TO THE NORTH OF THE NATCHER WEST BOUND RAMP AND IS TO THE EAST OF THE CROSS CREEK SUBDIVISION. THE TANKER WAS EMPTIED AND REMOVED.

THERE ARE SEVERAL MORE GOUGE MARKS ON THE GROUND BETWEEN THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL AND WHERE THE TRUCK CAME TO REST. THE TRUCK HAD ROLLED AND HIT A TREE LINE ON THE EDGE OF THE CORNFIELD KNOCKING DOWN THE TREES AND COMING TO A REST ON THE DRIVER SIDE. THE ROOF WAS CUT OFF TO REMOVE THE DRIVER. A DEPUTY WENT TO THE HOSPITAL TO SPEAK WITH THE DRIVER AND HE STATED THAT HE WAS NOT SPEEDING, NOT DRINKING, AND DID NOT FALL ASLEEP.

TIM ODEN, MANAGER OF OUR LITTLE ROCK TERMINAL CALLED U.S.E.S. TO DO THE CLEAN UP OF THE SPILL. ANOTHER ASPHALT TRANSPORT TRUCK AND TRAILER WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE TO HAVE THE CONTENTS OF THE OVERTURNED TRAILER PUMPED INTO THE 2ND TRAILER. AFTER THE TRANSFER WAS COMPLETE THE 2ND TRUCK CONTINUED TO THE ORIGINAL DESTINATION AND UNLOADED. A WRECKER SERVICE WAS CALLED TO TOW THE OVER TURNED TRUCK AND TRAILER TO OUR TERMINAL IN LITTLE ROCK ARKANSAS. U.S.E.S. CLEANED UP THE SPILLED PRODUCT AND TOOK CARE OF THE DISPOSAL OF THE WASTE. I SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER OF THE MANUFACTURER OF THE HARMON TANK TRAILER THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT, MR. LOY MCGEE. HE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THIS VENT ACCORDING TO DOT LAW MUST BE DESIGNED WITH NO MOVING PARTS. IT IS A PRESSURE VENT FOR TRAILERS HAULING ELEVATED TEMPERATURE PRODUCTS. IN OTHER WORDS IT CANNOT BE DESIGNED TO CLOSE UNDER ANY CONDITION. THE TRAILER VENT SHOULD NOT LEAK IF THE TRAILER IS UPRIGHT OR UPSIDE DOWN. AT ANY OTHER ANGLE THERE IS WAY TO STOP THIS VENT FROM LEAKING PRODUCT. THAT WAS THE EXPLANATION I GOT AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. CONTACT: HARMON TANK CO.
