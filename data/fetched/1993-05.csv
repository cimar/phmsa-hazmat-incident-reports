WHEN THE LOAD ARRIVED IN ELLWOOD CITY, THE TRUCK MADE A SHARP TURN AT THE INTERSECTION OF RT 288 (ELLWOOD-WAMPUM ROAD) ONTO 5TH STREET.  AT THAT POINT, THE LOAD IN THE CONTAINER ON THE PUP TRAILER APPARENTLY SHIFTED AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF FILTER CAKE SLIPPED OUT FROM UNDER THE TARPED LUGGER BOX AND ONTO THE ROADWAY.  THE DRIVER STOPPED AND CLEANED UP THE SPILL MATERIAL.  OUR DRIVER ESTIMATED THE SPILL AT TWO TO THREE POUNDS PLUS ABOUT ONE-HALF GALLONS OF WATER.  HE SOAKED THIS WITH FLOOR DRY AND PLACED IT BACK INTO THE BOX.  APPARENTLY, THE ELLWOOD CITY POLICE HAD RECEIVED A COMPLAINT THAT SOMETHING HAD BEEN SPILLED AT THIS LOCATION AS THE DRIVER WAS SEEN CLEANING IT UP.  THE MATERIAL HAS A BRIGHT GREEN CHARACTERISTIC WHICH COULD HAVE BROUGHT ATTENTION TO WHOMEVER SAW HIM CLEANING IT UP.  LIEUTENANT WILLIAM R. BETTS, OF THE ELLWOOD CITY POLICE, NOT KNOWING WHAT THE MATERIAL WAS, CONTACTED THE LAWERENCE COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY.  THIS IN TURN ACTIVATED THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM (THE RESPONSE TIME BY THE DER AND THE LCEMA WAS QUITE IMPRESSIVE).  FOLLOWING A DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUCK, LIEUTENANT BETTS LOCATED THE TRUCK AT THE MAIN GATE AT INMETCO. WITH LIEUTENANT BETTS HELP, THE DRIVER AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGER OF INMETCO, JOHN ONUSKA, WENT TO THE SPILL LOCATION.  THEY SWEPT THE AREA ONCE AGAIN TO ENSURE THERE WAS NO MORE RESIDUE AND DID FIND APPROXIMATELY A HANDFUL OF MATERIAL A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY, WHICH WAS COLLECTED AND THE AREA CLEANED UP.  THE REPORTABLE QUATITY OF THIS MATERIAL IS 10 POUNDS. THE TOTAL COLLECTION OF THIS MATERIAL WAS APPROXIMATELY  ONE COFFEE CAN FULL (2 TO 3 POUNDS).
