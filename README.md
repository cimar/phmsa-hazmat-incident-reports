# PHMSA "5800.1" Hazardous Materials Incident Reports

[Federal law](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-171/subpart-B/section-171.16)Â requires spills, explosions, and other safety-endangering [incidents involving hazardous materials](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-171/subpart-B/section-171.15#p-171.15\(b\)) to be reported to the [Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/) (PHMSA).

Specifically, "each person in physical possession of a hazardous material at the time that any of [certain types of incidents] occurs during transportation (including loading, unloading, and temporary storage) must submit a Hazardous Materials Incident Report on DOT Form F 5800.1 [...] within 30 days of discovery of the incident".

PHSMA publishes those "5800.1" reports [through an online portal](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat-program-management-data-and-statistics/data-operations/incident-statistics). That portal, however, is brittle and does not provide a straightforward mechanism to download the full set of submitted reports.

This repository, developed by the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/), aims to do the following:

- Automate the downloading of all data available through the portal
    - Status: ðŸ”µ Data available for the past 20 years (back to January 2003), the rest (going back to 1971) to be added soon
- Develop documentation to aid in the interpretation of the reports
    - Status: ðŸ”µ In progress
- Generate one file that contains a subset of fields (to keep size within GitHub's limits) for *all* reports
    - Status: ðŸŸ  Not yet started
- Provide RSS feeds with the latest available incidents, nationally and by state
    - Status: ðŸŸ  Not yet started
- Provide RSS feeds listing incident [updates](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-171/subpart-B/section-171.16#p-171.16\(c\))
    - Status: ðŸŸ  Not yet started
- Standardize/normalize the data
    - Status: ðŸŸ  Not yet started

## Available Data

In the [`data/fetched`](data/fetched/) directory, you can find CSVs containing the report information, with one month of data per CSV. Note that recent months' data may be incomplete (due to yet-unsubmitted reports), and will be regularly updated.

(The files are split into months to stay within GitHub's file size limits. You can combine them with your preferred toolset. For example, using [`xsv`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv#installation), you could run `xsv cat rows data/fetched/*.csv > combined.csv`.)

### Resources

- [PHMSA's data dictionary for the report data](https://portal.phmsa.dot.gov/HIP_Help/DataDictionary.pdf)
- [PHMSA's *Serious Incident Definition*](https://portal.phmsa.dot.gov/HIP_Help/DataDictionary.pdf)

### Notes

- Some reports are represented by *more than one row*. This happens when the report includes multiple values for a field that the data exports only represent as a single column, such as the name and quantity of the material released. You can identify these multiple-row reports via the `Multiple Rows Per Incident` column.
- Although the vast majority of entries represent hazardous materials incident, some do not. The `Report Type` column provides that detail, and includes values such as "Undeclared Shipment with no Release" and "A specification cargo tank 1,000 gallons or greater containing any hazardous materials that [...]".
